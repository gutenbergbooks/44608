<h3><span class="smcap">Introductory.</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> book is a translation of Babur Padshah’s Autobiography, made
from the original Turki text. It was undertaken after a purely-Turki
manuscript had become accessible in England, the Haidarabad
Codex (1915) which, being in Babur’s <i>ipsissima verba</i>, left to him
the control of his translator’s diction&mdash;a control that had been
impracticable from the time when, under Akbar (1589), his book was
translated into Persian. What has come down to us of pure text is,
in its shrunken amount, what was translated in 1589. It is difficult,
here and there, to interpret owing to its numerous and in some places
extensive <i>lacunæ</i>, and presents more problems than one the solution
of which has real importance because they have favoured suggestions
of malfeasance by Babur.</p>

<p>My translation has been produced under considerable drawback,
having been issued in four <i>fasciculi</i>, at long intervals, respectively in
June 1912, May 1914, October 1917, and September 1921. I have put
with it of supplementary matter what may be of service to those
readers whom Babur’s personality attracts and to those who study
Turki as a linguistic entertainment, but owing to delays in production
am unable to include the <i>desiderata</i> of maps.</p>

<small>BABUR’S EXEMPLARS IN THE ARTS OF PEACE.</small></h3>

<p>Babur’s civilian aptitudes, whether of the author and penman, the
maker of gardens, the artist, craftsman or sportsman, were nourished
in a fertile soil of family tradition and example. Little about his
teaching and training is now with his mutilated book, little indeed of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[Pg xxviii]</a></span>
any kind about his præ-accession years, not the date of his birth
even, having escaped destruction.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> Happily Haidar Mirza (<i>q.v.</i>)
possessed a more complete Codex than has come down to us through
the Timurid libraries, and from it he translated many episodes of
Baburiana that help to bridge gaps and are of special service here
where the personalities of Bābur’s early environment are being
named.</p>

<p>Babur’s home-milieu favoured excellence in the quiet Arts and
set before its children high standard and example of proficiency.
Moreover, by schooling him in obedience to the Law, it planted
in him some of Art’s essentials, self-restraint and close attention.
Amongst primal influences on him, his mother Qut-luq-nigar’s ranked
high; she, well-born and a scholar’s daughter, would certainly be
educated in Turki and Persian and in the home-accomplishments
her governess possessed <i>(ātūn</i> q.v.). From her and her mother
Aisan-daulat, the child would learn respect for the attainments of his
wise old grandfather Yunas Khan. Aisan-daulat herself brought to
her grandson much that goes to the making of a man; nomad-born
and sternly-bred, she was brave to obey her opinion of right, and was
practically the boy’s ruling counsellor through his early struggle to
hold Farghana. With these two in fine influence must be counted
Khan-zada, his five-years elder sister who from his birth to his death
proved her devotion to him. Her life-story tempts, but is too long to
tell; her girlish promise is seen fulfilled in Gul-badan’s pages. ‘Umar
Shaikh’s own mother Shah Sultan Begim brought in a type of merit
widely differing from that of Aisan-daulat Begim; as a town-lady of
high Tarkhan birth, used to the amenities of life in a wealthy house
of Samarkand, she was, doubtless, an accomplished and cultured
woman.</p>

<p>‘Umar Shaikh’s environment was dominated for many years by
two great men, the scholar and lover of town-life Yunas Khan and
the saintly Ahrari (<i>i.e.</i> Khwaja ‘Ubaidu’l-lah) who were frequently
with him in company, came at Babur’s birth and assisted at his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[Pg xxix]</a></span>naming. Ahrari died in 895-1491 when the child was about seven
years old but his influence was life-long; in 935-1529 he was invoked
as a spiritual helper by the fever-stricken Babur and his mediation
believed efficacious for recovery (pp. <a href="#Page_619">619</a>, <a href="#Page_648">648</a>). For the babe or boy
to be where the three friends held social session in high converse,
would be thought to draw blessing on him; his hushed silence in
the presence would sow the seed of reverence for wisdom and virtue,
such, for example, as he felt for Jami (<i>q.v.</i>). It is worth while to tell
some part at least of Yunas’ attainments in the gentler Arts, because
the biography from which they are quoted may well have been written
on the information of his wife Aisan-daulat, and it indicates the
breadth of his exemplary influence. Yunas was many things&mdash;penman,
painter, singer, instrumentalist, and a past master in the
crafts. He was an expert in good companionship, having even
temper and perfect manners, quick perception and conversational
charm. His intellectual distinction was attributed to his twelve
years of wardship under the learned and highly honoured Yazdi
(Sharafu’d-din ’Ali), the author of the <i>Zafar-nama</i> [Timur’s Book
of Victory]. That book was in hand during four years of Yunas’
education; he will thus have known it and its main basis Timur’s
Turki <i>Malfūzāt</i> (annals). What he learned of either book he would
carry with him into ‘Umar Shaikh’s environment, thus magnifying
the family stock of Timuriya influence. He lived to be some 74 years
old, a length of days which fairly bridged the gap between Timur’s
death [807-1404] and Babur’s birth (888-1483). It is said that no
previous Khan of his (Chaghatai) line had survived his 40th year;
his exceptional age earned him great respect and would deepen his
influence on his restless young son-in-law ‘Umar Shaikh. It appears
to have been in ‘Umar’s 20th year (<i>cir.</i>) that Yunas Khan began the
friendly association with him that lasted till Yunas’ death (892-1483),
a friendship which, as disparate ages would dictate, was rather that
of father and son than of equal companionship. One matter
mentioned in the Khan’s biography would come to Babur’s
remembrance in the future days when he, like Yunas, broke the Law
against intoxicants and, like him, repented and returned.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[Pg xxx]</a></span></p>

<p>That two men of the calibre and high repute of Ahrari and Yunas
maintained friendly guidance so long over ‘Umar cannot but be held
an accreditment and give fragrance of goodness to his name. Apart
from the high justice and generosity his son ascribes to him, he could
set other example, for he was a reader of great books, the Qoran and
the <i>Masnawi</i> being amongst his favourites. This choice, it may be,
led Abu’l-faẓl to say he had the darwesh-mind. Babur was old
enough before ‘Umar’s death to profit by the sight of his father
enjoying the perusal of such books. As with other parents and other
children, there would follow the happy stilling to a quiet mood, the
piquing of curiosity as to what was in the book, the sight of refuge
taken as in a haven from self and care, and perhaps, Babur being
intelligent and of inquiring mind and ‘Umar a skilled reciter, the
boy would marvel at the perennial miracle that a lifeless page can
become eloquent&mdash;gentle hints all, pointers of the way to literary
creation.</p>

<p>Few who are at home in Baburiana but will take Timur as Babur’s
great exemplar not only as a soldier but as a chronicler. Timur
cannot have seemed remote from that group of people so well-informed
about him and his civilian doings; his Shahrukhi grandchildren in
Samarkand had carried on his author-tradition; the 74 years of
Yunas Khan’s life had bridged the gap between Timur’s death in
807-1405 and Babur’s birth in 888-1483. To Babur Timur will
have been exemplary through his grandson Aulugh Beg who has
two productions to his credit, the <i>Char-ulus</i> (Four Hordes) and the
Kurkani Astronomical Tables. His sons, again, Babur (<i>qalandar</i>)
and Ibrahim carried on the family torch of letters, the first in verse
and the second by initiating and fostering Yazdi’s labours on the
<i>Zafar-nama</i>. Wide-radiating and potent influence for the Arts of
Peace came forth from Herat during the reign of that Sultan Husain
Mirza whose Court Babur describes in one of the best supplements
to his autobiography. Husain was a Timurid of the elder branch of
Bai-qara, an author himself but far more effective as a Macænas;
one man of the shining galaxy of competence that gave him fame,
set pertinent example for Babur the author, namely, the Andijani<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[Pg xxxi]</a></span>
of noble Chaghatai family, ’Ali-sher <i>Nawa’i</i> who, in classic Turki
verse was the master Babur was to become in its prose. That the
standard of effort was high in Herat is clear from Babur’s dictum
(p. 233) that whatever work a man took up, he aspired to bring it to
perfection. Elphinstone varies the same theme to the tune of
equality of excellence apart from social status, writing to Erskine
(August, 1826), that “it gives a high notion of the time to find” (in
Babur’s account of Husain’s Court) “artists, musicians and others,
described along with the learned and great of the Age”.</p>

<p>My meagre summary of Babur’s exemplars would be noticeably
incomplete if it omitted mention of two of his life-long helpers in
the gentler Arts, his love of Nature and his admiration for great
architectural creations. The first makes joyous accompaniment
throughout his book; the second is specially called forth by Timur’s
ennoblement of Samarkand. Timur had built magnificently and laid
out stately gardens; Babur made many a fruitful pleasaunce and
gladdened many an arid halting-place; he built a little, but had
small chance to test his capacity for building greatly; never rich,
he was poor in Kabul and several times destitute in his home-lands.
But his sword won what gave wealth to his Indian Dynasty, and he
passed on to it the builder’s unused dower, so that Samarkand was
surpassed in Hindustan and the spiritual conception Timur’s creations
embodied took perfect form at Sikandra where Akbar lies entombed.</p>

<hr />

<h3><span class="smcap">Chapter II.</span><br />

<small>PROBLEMS OF THE MUTILATED BABUR-NAMA.</small></h3>

<p>Losses from the text of Babur’s book are the more disastrous
because it truly embodies his career. For it has the rare distinction
of being contemporary with the events it describes, is boyish in his
boyhood, grows with his growth, matures as he matured. Undulled
by retrospect, it is a fresh and spontaneous recital of things just seen,
heard or done. It has the further rare distinction of shewing a boy
who, setting a future task before him&mdash;in his case the revival of
Timurid power,&mdash;began to chronicle his adventure in the book which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[Pg xxxii]</a></span>
through some 37 years was his twinned comrade, which by its special
distinctions has attracted readers for nearly a half-millennium, still
attracts and still is a thing apart from autobiographies which look
back to recall dead years.</p>

<p>Much circumstance makes for the opinion that Babur left his
life-record complete, perhaps repaired in places and recently supplemented,
but continuous, orderly and lucid; this it is not now, nor
has been since it was translated into Persian in 1589, for it is fissured
by <i>lacunæ</i>, has neither Preface nor Epilogue,<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> opens in an oddly
abrupt and incongruous fashion, and consists of a series of fragments
so disconnected as to demand considerable preliminary explanation.
Needless to say, its dwindled condition notwithstanding, it has place
amongst great autobiographies, still revealing its author playing a
man’s part in a drama of much historic and personal interest. Its
revelation is however now like a portrait out of drawing, because it
has not kept the record of certain years of his manhood in which he
took momentous decisions,(1) those of 1511-12 [918] in which he
accepted reinforcement&mdash;at a great price&mdash;from Isma‘il the Shi‘a
Shah of Persia, and in which, if my reading be correct, he first
(1512) broke the Law against the use of wine,<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> (2) those of 1519-1525
[926-932], in which his literary occupations with orthodox Law (<i>see
Mubin</i>) associated with cognate matters of 932 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> indicate that his
return to obedience had begun, in which too was taken the decision
that worked out for his fifth expedition across the Indus with its
sequel of the conquest of Hind.&mdash;The loss of matter so weighty
cannot but destroy the balance of his record and falsify the drawing
of his portrait.</p>

<p class="indent">a. <i>Problem of Titles.</i></p>

<p>As nothing survives to decide what was Babur’s chosen title for
his autobiography, a modern assignment of names to distinguish it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[Pg xxxiii]</a></span>from its various descendants is desirable, particularly so since the
revival of interest in it towards which the Facsimile of its Haidarabad
Codex has contributed.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p><i>Babur-nama</i> (History of Babur) is a well-warranted name by which
to distinguish the original Turki text, because long associated with
this and rarely if ever applied to its Persian translation.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> It is
not comprehensive because not covering supplementary matter of
biography and description but it has use for modern readers of
classing Babur’s with other Timuriya and Timurid histories such as
the <i>Zafar-Humayun-Akbar-namas</i>.</p>

<p><i>Waqi‘āt-i-baburi</i> (Babur’s Acts), being descriptive of the book and
in common use for naming both the Turki and Persian texts, might
usefully be reserved as a title for the latter alone.</p>

<p>Amongst European versions of the book <i>Memoirs of Baber</i> is
Erskine’s peculium for the Leyden and Erskine Perso-English translation&mdash;<i>Mémoires
de Baber</i> is Pavet de Courteille’s title for his
French version of the Bukhara [Persified-Turki] compilation&mdash;<i>Babur-nama
in English</i> links the translation these volumes contain with its
purely-Turki source.</p>

<p class="indent">b. <i>Problems of the Constituents of the Books.</i></p>

<p>Intact or mutilated, Babur’s material falls naturally into three
territorial divisions, those of the lands of his successive rule, Farghana
(with Samarkand), Kabul and Hindustan. With these are distinct
sub-sections of description of places and of obituaries of kinsmen.</p>

<p>The book might be described as consisting of annals and diary,
which once met within what is now the gap of 1508-19 (914-925).
Round this gap, amongst others, bristle problems of which this
change of literary style is one; some are small and concern the
mutilation alone, others are larger, but all are too intricate for terse
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[Pg xxxiv]</a></span>statement and all might be resolved by the help of a second MS.
<i>e.g.</i> one of the same strain as Haidar’s.</p>

<p>Without fantasy another constituent might be counted in with the
three territorial divisions, namely, the grouped <i>lacunæ</i> which by their
engulfment of text are an untoward factor in an estimate either of
Babur or of his book. They are actually the cardinal difficulty of
the book as it now is; they foreshorten purview of his career and
character and detract from its merits; they lose it perspective and
distort its proportions. That this must be so is clear both from the
value and the preponderating amount of the lost text. It is no
exaggeration to say that while working on what survives, what is
lost becomes like a haunting presence warning that it must be
remembered always as an integral and the dominant part of the book.</p>

<p>The relative proportions of saved and lost text are highly
significant:&mdash;Babur’s commemorable years are about 47 and 10
months, <i>i.e.</i> from his birth on Feb. 14th 1483 to near his death on
Dec. 26th 1530; but the aggregate of surviving text records some
18 years only, and this not continuously but broken through by
numerous gaps. That these gaps result from loss of pages is frequently
shewn by a broken sentence, an unfinished episode. The
fragments&mdash;as they truly may be called&mdash;are divided by gaps sometimes
seeming to remove a few pages only (cf. <i>s.a.</i> 935 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>), sometimes
losing the record of 6 and <i>cir.</i> 18 months, sometimes of 6 and 11
years; besides these actual clefts in the narrative there are losses of
some 12 years from its beginning and some 16 months from its end.
Briefly put we now have the record of <i>cir.</i> 18 years where that of over
47 could have been.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<p class="indent">c. <i>Causes of the gaps.</i></p>

<p>Various causes have been surmised to explain the <i>lacunæ</i>; on the
plea of long intimacy with Babur’s and Haidar’s writings, I venture
to say that one and all appear to me the result of accident. This
opinion rests on observed correlations between the surviving and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[Pg xxxv]</a></span>lost record, which demand complement&mdash;on the testimony of Haidar’s
extracts, and firmly on Babur’s orderly and persistent bias of mind
and on the prideful character of much of the lost record. Moreover
occasions of risk to Babur’s papers are known.</p>

<p>Of these occasions the first was the destruction of his camp near
Hisar in 1512 (918; p. 357) but no information about his papers
survives; they may not have been in his tent but in the fort. The
second was a case of recorded damage to “book and sections” (p. 679)
occurring in 1529 (935). From signs of work done to the Farghana
section in Hindustan, the damage may be understood made good at
the later date. To the third exposure to damage, namely, the attrition
of hard travel and unsettled life during Humayun’s 14 years of exile
from rule in Hindustan (1441-1555) it is reasonable to attribute even
the whole loss of text. For, assuming&mdash;as may well be done&mdash;that
Babur left (1530) a complete autobiography, its volume would be safe
so long as Humayun was in power but after the Timurid exodus
(1441) his library would be exposed to the risks detailed in the
admirable chronicles of Gul-badan, Jauhar and Bayazid (<i>q.v.</i>). He
is known to have annotated his father’s book in 1555 (p. 466 n. 1)
just before marching from Kabul to attempt the re-conquest of
Hindustan. His Codex would return to Dihli which he entered in
July 1555, and there would be safe from risk of further mutilation.
Its condition in 1555 is likely to have remained what it was found
when ‘Abdu’r-rahim translated it into Persian by Akbar’s orders
(1589) for Abu’l-faẓl’s use in the <i>Akbar-nama</i>. That Persian translation
with its descendant the <i>Memoirs of Baber</i>, and the purely-Turki
Haidarabad Codex with its descendant the <i>Babur-nama in
English</i>, contain identical contents and, so doing, carry the date of
the mutilation of Babur’s Turki text back through its years of safety,
1589 to 1555, to the period of Humayun’s exile and its dangers for
camel-borne or deserted libraries.</p>

<p class="indent">d. <i>Two misinterpretations of lacunæ.</i></p>

<p>Not unnaturally the frequent interruptions of narrative caused
by <i>lacunæ</i> have been misinterpreted occasionally, and sometimes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[Pg xxxvi]</a></span>
detractory comment has followed on Babur, ranking him below the
accomplished and lettered, steadfast and honest man he was. I select
two examples of this comment neither of which has a casual origin.</p>

<p>The first is from the <i>B.M. Cat. of Coins of the Shahs of Persia</i>
p. xxiv, where after identifying a certain gold coin as shewing
vassalage by Babur to Isma‘il <i>Safawi</i>, the compiler of the Catalogue
notes, “We can now understand the omission from Babar’s ‘Memoirs’
of the occurrences between 914 <span class="smcap">H.</span> and 925 <span class="smcap">H.</span>” Can these words
imply other than that Babur suppressed mention of minting of the
coins shewing acknowledgment of Shi‘a suzerainty? Leaving aside
the delicate topic of the detraction the quoted words imply, much
negatives the surmise that the gap is a deliberate “omission” of
text:&mdash;(1) the duration of the Shi‘a alliance was 19-20 months of
917-918 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (p. 355), why omit the peaceful or prideful and victorious
record of some 9-10 years on its either verge? (2) Babur’s Transoxus
campaign was an episode in the struggle between Shaibaq Khan
(Shaibani) <i>Auzbeg</i> and Shah Isma‘il&mdash;between Sunni and Shi‘a;
how could “omission” from his book, always a rare one, hide what
multitudes knew already? “Omission” would have proved a fiasco
in another region than Central Asia, because the Babur-Haidar story
of the campaign, vassal-coinage included,<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> has been brought into
English literature by the English translation of the <i>Tarikh-i rashidi</i>.
Babur’s frank and self-judging habit of mind would, I think, lead
him to write fully of the difficulties which compelled the hated alliance
and certainly he would tell of his own anger at the conduct of the
campaign by Isma‘il’s Commanders. The alliance was a tactical
mistake; it would have served Babur better to narrate its failure.</p>

<p>The second misinterpretation, perhaps a mere surmising gloss, is
Erskine’s (<i>Memoirs</i> Supp. p. 289) who, in connection with ‘Alam
Khan’s request to Babur for reinforcement in order to oust his nephew
Ibrahim, observes that “Babur probably flattered ‘Alam Khan with
the hope of succession to the empire of Hindustan.” This idea does
not fit the record of either man. Elphinstone was angered by
Erskine’s remark which, he wrote (Aug. 26th 1826) “had a bad
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">[Pg xxxvii]</a></span>effect on the narrative by weakening the implicit confidence in
Babur’s candour and veracity which his frank way of writing is so
well-calculated to command.” Elphinstone’s opinion of Babur is not
that of a reader but of a student of his book; he was also one of
Erskine’s staunchest helpers in its production. From Erskine’s
surmise others have advanced on the detractor’s path saying that
Babur used and threw over ‘Alam Khan (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p class="indent">e. <i>Reconstruction.</i></p>

<p>Amongst the problems mutilation has created an important one is
that of the condition of the beginning of the book (p. 1 to p. 30) with
its plunge into Babur’s doings in his 12th year without previous
mention of even his day and place of birth, the names and status
of his parents, or any occurrences of his præ-accession years. Within
those years should be entered the death of Yunas Khan (1487) with
its sequent obituary notice, and the death of [Khwaja ‘Ubaidu’l-lah]
Ahrari (1491). Not only are these customary entries absent but the
very introductions of the two great men are wanting, probably with
the also missing account of their naming of the babe Babur. That
these routine matters are a part of an autobiography planned as
Babur’s was, makes for assured opinion that the record of more than
his first decade of life has been lost, perhaps by the attrition to which
its position in the volume exposed it.</p>

<p>Useful reconstruction if merely in tabulated form, might be effected
in a future edition. It would save at least two surprises for readers,
one the oddly abrupt first sentence telling of Babur’s age when he
became ruler in Farghana (p. 1), which is a misfit in time and order,
another that of the sudden interruption of ‘Umar Shaikh’s obituary
by a fragment of Yunas Khan’s (p. 19) which there hangs on a mere
name-peg, whereas its place according to Babur’s elsewhere unbroken
practice is directly following the death. The record of the missing
præ-accession years will have included at the least as follows:&mdash;Day
of birth and its place&mdash;names and status of parents&mdash;naming and
the ceremonial observances proper for Muhammadan children&mdash;visits
to kinsfolk in Tashkint, and to Samarkand (æt. 5, p. 35) where he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">[Pg xxxviii]</a></span>
was betrothed&mdash;his initiation in school subjects, in sport, the use of
arms&mdash;names of teachers&mdash;education in the rules of his Faith (p. 44),
appointment to the Andijan Command <i>etc.</i>, <i>etc.</i></p>

<p>There is now no fit beginning to the book; the present first
sentence and its pendent description of Farghana should be removed
to the position Babur’s practice dictates of entering the description
of a territory at once on obtaining it (cf. Samarkand, Kabul, Hindustan).
It might come in on p. 30 at the end of the topic (partly
omitted on p. 29 where no ground is given for the manifest anxiety
about Babur’s safety) of the disputed succession (Haidar, trs. p. 135)
Babur’s partisan begs having the better of Jahangir’s (<i>q.v.</i>), and having
testified obeisance, he became ruler in Farghana; his statement of
age (12 years), comes in naturally and the description of his newly
acquired territory follows according to rule. This removal of text
to a later position has the advantage of allowing the accession to
follow and not precede Babur’s father’s death.</p>

<p>By the removal there is left to consider the historical matter of
pp. 12-13. The first paragraph concerns matter of much earlier date
than ‘Umar’s death in 1494 (p. 13); it may be part of an obituary
notice, perhaps that of Yunas Khan. What follows of the advance
of displeased kinsmen against ‘Umar Shaikh would fall into place as
part of Babur’s record of his boyhood, and lead on to that of his
father’s death.</p>

<p>The above is a bald sketch of what might be effected in the
interests of the book and to facilitate its pleasant perusal.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chapter III.</span><br />

<small>THE TURKI MSS. AND WORK CONNECTING WITH THEM.</small></h3>

<p>This chapter is a literary counterpart of “Babur Padshah’s Stone-heap,”
the roadside cairn tradition says was piled by his army, each
man laying his stone when passing down from Kabul for Hindustan
in the year of victory 1525 (932).<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">[Pg xxxix]</a></span></p>
<p>For a title suiting its contents is “Babur Padshah’s Book-pile,”
because it is fashioned of item after item of pen-work done by
many men in obedience to the dictates given by his book. Unlike
the cairn, however, the pile of books is not of a single occasion
but of many, not of a single year but of many, irregularly spacing
the 500 years through which he and his autobiography have had
Earth’s immortality.</p>

<p class="center"><b>Part I. The MSS. themselves.</b></p>

<p><i>Preliminary.</i>&mdash;Much of the information given below was published
in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society from 1900 onwards, as
it came into my possession during a search for reliable Turki text
of the <i>Babur-nama</i>. My notes were progressive; some MSS. were
in distant places, some not traceable, but in the end I was able to
examine in England all of whose continued existence I had become
aware. It was inevitable that some of my earlier statements should
be superseded later; my Notes (<i>see s.n.</i> JRAS.) need clearing of
transitory matter and summarizing, in particular those on the
Elphinstone Codex and Klaproth’s articles. Neither they nor what
is placed here makes claim to be complete. Other workers will
supplement them when the World has renewed opportunity to
stroll in the bye-paths of literature.</p>

<p>Few copies of the <i>Babur-nama</i> seem to have been made; of the
few I have traced as existing, not one contains the complete
autobiography, and one alone has the maximum of dwindled text
shewn in the Persian translation (1589). Two books have been
reputed to contain Babur’s authentic text, one preserved in
Hindustan by his descendants, the other issuing from Bukhara.
They differ in total contents, arrangement and textual worth;
moreover the Bukhara book compiles items of divers diction and
origin and date, manifestly not from one pen.</p>

<p>The Hindustan book is a record&mdash;now mutilated&mdash;of the Acts of
Babur alone; the Bukhara book as exhibited in its fullest accessible
example, Kehr’s Codex, is in two parts, each having its preface, the
first reciting Babur’s Acts, the second Humayun’s.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl">[Pg xl]</a></span></p>

<p>The Bukhara book is a compilation of oddments, mostly translated
from compositions written after Babur’s death. Textual and
circumstantial grounds warrant the opinion that it is a distinct
work mistakenly believed to be Babur’s own; to these grounds was
added in 1903 the authoritative verdict of collation with the
Haidarabad Codex, and in 1921 of the colophon of its original MS.
in which its author gives his name, with the title and date of his
compilation (JRAS. 1900, p. 474). What it is and what are its
contents and history are told in Part III of this chapter.</p>

<p class="center"><b>Part II. Work on the Hindustan MSS.</b></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Babur’s Original Codex.</span></p>

<p>My latest definite information about Babur’s autograph MS.
comes from the <i>Padshah-nama</i> (Bib. Ind. ed. ii, 4), whose author
saw it in Shah-i-jahan’s private library between 1628 and 1638.
Inference is justified, however, that it was the archetype of the
Haidarabad Codex which has been estimated from the quality
of its paper as dating <i>cir.</i> 1700 (JRAS. 1906, p. 97). But two
subsequent historic disasters complicate all questions of MSS.
missing from Indian libraries, namely, Nadir Shah’s vengeance on
Dihli in 1739 and the dispersions and fires of the Mutiny. Faint
hope is kept alive that the original Codex may have drifted into
private hands, by what has occurred with the Rampur MS. of
Babur’s Hindustan verses (App. J), which also appears once to
have belonged to Shah-i-jahan.</p>

<p class="center">I</p>

<p>Amongst items of work done during Babur’s life are copies of
his book (or of the Hindustan section of it) he mentions sending to
sons and friends.</p>

<p class="center">II</p>

<p>The <i>Tabaqat-i-baburi</i> was written during Babur’s life by his
Persian secretary Shaikh Zainu’d-din of Khawaf; it paraphrases
in rhetorical Persian the record of a few months of Hindustan
campaigning, including the battle of Panipat.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xli" id="Page_xli">[Pg xli]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">III</p>

<p>During the first decade of Humayun’s reign (1530-40) at least
two important codices seem to have been copied.</p>

<p>The earlier (<i>see</i> Table, No. 2) has varied circumstantial warrant.
It meets the need of an archetype, one marginally annotated by
Humayun, for the Elphinstone Codex in which a few notes are
marginal and signed, others are pell-mell, interpolated in the text
but attested by a scrutineer as having been marginal in its archetype
and mistakenly copied into its text. This second set has been
ineffectually sponged over. Thus double collation is indicated
(i) with Babur’s autograph MS. to clear out extra Babur matter,
and (ii) with its archetype, to justify the statement that in this
the interpolations were marginal.&mdash;No colophon survives with the
much dwindled Elph. Codex, but one, suiting the situation, has been
observed, where it is a complete misfit, appended to the Alwar Codex
of the second Persian translation, (estimated as copied in 1589). Into
the incongruities of that colophon it is not necessary to examine
here, they are too obvious to aim at deceit; it appears fitly to be an
imperfect translation from a Turki original, this especially through
its odd fashion of entitling “Humayun Padshah.” It can be
explained as translating the colophon of the Codex (No. 2) which,
as his possession, Humayun allowably annotated and which makes
it known that he had ordered ‘Ali’u-’l-katib to copy his father’s
Turki book, and that it was finished in February, 1531, some six
weeks after Babur’s death.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></p>

<p>The later copy made in Humayun’s first decade is Haidar
Mirza’s (<i>infra</i>).</p>

<p class="center">IV</p>

<p>Muhammad Haidar Mirza <i>Dughlat’s</i> possession of a copy of the
Autobiography is known both from his mention of it and through
numerous extracts translated from it in his <i>Tarikh-i-rashidi</i>. As a
good boy-penman (p. 22) he may have copied down to 1512 (918)
while with Babur (p. 350), but for obtaining a transcript of it his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xliii" id="Page_xliii">[Pg xliii]</a></span>opportunity was while with Humayun before the Timurid exodus
of 1541. He died in 1551; his Codex is likely to have found its
way back from Kashmir to his ancestral home in the Kashghar
region and there it may still be. (<i>See</i> T.R. trs. Ney Elias’ biography
of him).</p>

<p class="center">V</p>

<p>The Elphinstone Codex<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> has had an adventurous career. The
enigma of its archetype is posed above; it may have been copied
during Akbar’s first decade (1556-67); its, perhaps first, owner
was a Bai-qara rebel (d. 1567) from amongst whose possessions it
passed into the Royal Library, where it was cleared of foreign matter
by the expunction of Humayun’s marginal notes which its scribe
had interpolated into its text. At a date I do not know, it must
have left the Royal Library for its fly-leaves bear entries of prices
and in 1810 it was found and purchased in Peshawar by Elphinstone.
It went with him to Calcutta, and there may have been seen by
Leyden during the short time between its arrival and the autumn
month of the same year (1810) when he sailed for Java. In 1813
Elphinstone in Poona sent it to Erskine in Bombay, saying that he
had fancied it gone to Java and had been writing to ‘Izzatu’l-lah
to procure another MS. for Erskine in Bukhara, but that all the
time it was on his own shelves. Received after Erskine had dolefully
compared his finished work with Leyden’s (tentative) translation,
Erskine sadly recommenced the review of his own work. The Codex
had suffered much defacement down to 908 (1502) at the hands of
“a Persian Turk of Ganj” who had interlined it with explanations.
It came to Scotland (with Erskine?) who in 1826 sent it with a
covering letter (Dec. 12th, 1826), at its owner’s desire, to the
Advocates’ Library where it now is. In 1907 it was fully described
by me in the JRAS.</p>

<p class="center">VI</p>

<p>Of two <i>Waqi’at-i-baburi</i> (Pers. trs.) made in Akbar’s reign, the
earlier was begun in 1583, at private instance, by two Mughuls
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xliv" id="Page_xliv">[Pg xliv]</a></span>Payanda-hasan of Ghazni and Muhammad-quli of Hisar. The
Bodleian and British Museum Libraries have copies of it, very
fragmentary unfortunately, for it is careful, likeable, and helpful
by its small explanatory glosses. It has the great defect of not
preserving autobiographic quality in its diction.</p>

<p class="center">VII</p>

<p>The later <i>Waqi’at-i-baburi</i> translated by ‘Abdu’r-rahim Mirza is
one of the most important items in Baburiana, both by its special
characteristics as the work of a Turkman and not of a Persian,
and by the great service it has done. Its origin is well-known;
it was made at Akbar’s order to help Abu’l-faẓl in the Akbar-nāma
account of Babur and also to facilitate perusal of the <i>Babur-nama</i>
in Hindustan. It was presented to Akbar, by its translator who
had come up from Gujrat, in the last week of November, 1589, on
an occasion and at a place of admirable fitness. For Akbar had
gone to Kabul to visit Babur’s tomb, and was halting on his return
journey at Barik-ab where Babur had halted on his march down
to Hindustan in the year of victory 1525, at no great distance
from “Babur Padshah’s Stone-heap”. Abu’l-faẓl’s account of
the presentation will rest on ‘Abdu’r-rahim’s information (A.N.
trs. cap. ci). The diction of this translation is noticeable; it gave
much trouble to Erskine who thus writes of it (<i>Memoirs</i> Preface,
lx), “Though simple and precise, a close adherence to the idioms
and forms of expression of the Turki original joined to a want of
distinctness in the use of the relatives, often renders the meaning
extremely obscure, and makes it difficult to discover the connexion
of the different members of the sentence.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> The style is frequently
not Persian.... Many of the Turki words are untranslated.”</p>

<p>Difficult as these characteristics made Erskine’s interpretation,
it appears to me likely that they indirectly were useful to him by
restraining his diction to some extent in their Turki fettering.&mdash;This
Turki fettering has another aspect, apart from Erskine’s difficulties,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlv" id="Page_xlv">[Pg xlv]</a></span><i>viz</i>. it would greatly facilitate re-translation into Turki, such as has
been effected, I think, in the Farghana section of the Bukhara
compilation.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></p>

<p class="center">VIII</p>

<p>This item of work, a harmless attempt of Salim (<i>i.e</i>. Jahangir
Padshah; 1605-28) to provide the ancestral autobiography with
certain stop-gaps, has caused much needless trouble and discussion
without effecting any useful result. It is this:&mdash;In his own autobiography,
the <i>Tuzuk-i-jahangiri s.a</i>. 1607, he writes of a Babur-nama
Codex he examined, that it was all in Babur’s “blessed handwriting”
except four portions which were in his own and each of which he
attested in Turki as so being. Unfortunately he did not specify his
topics; unfortunately also no attestation has been found to passages
reasonably enough attributable to his activities. His portions may
consist of the “Rescue-passage” (App. D) and a length of translation
from the <i>Akbar-nāma</i>, a continuous part of its Babur chapter
but broken up where only I have seen it, <i>i.e.</i> the Bukhara compilation,
into (1) a plain tale of Kanwa (1527), (2) episodes of Babur’s
latter months (1529)&mdash;both transferred to the first person&mdash;and
(3) an account of Babur’s death (December 26th, 1530) and Court.</p>

<p>Jahangir’s occupation, harmless in itself, led to an imbroglio of
Langlés with Erskine, for the former stating in the <i>Biographie
Universelle</i> art. Babour, that Babour’s Commentaries “<i>augmentés
par Jahangir</i>” were translated into Persian by ‘Abdu’r-rahim.
Erskine made answer, “I know not on what authority the learned
Langlés hazarded this assertion, which is certainly incorrect”
(<i>Memoirs</i>, Preface, p. ix). Had Langlés somewhere met with
Jahangir’s attestations? He had authority if he had seen merely the
statement of 1607, but Erskine was right also, because the Persian
translation contains no more than the unaugmented Turki text.
The royal stop-gaps are in Kehr’s MS. and through Ilminski reached
De Courteille, whence the biting and thorough analysis of the
three “Fragments” by Teufel. Both episodes&mdash;the Langlés and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlvi" id="Page_xlvi">[Pg xlvi]</a></span>Teufel ones&mdash;are time-wasters but they are comprehensible in the
circumstances that Jahangir could not foresee the consequences
of his doubtless good intentions.</p>

<p>If the question arise of how writings that had had place in
Jahangir’s library reached Bukhara, their open road is through the
Padshah’s correspondence (App. Q and references), with a descendant
of Ahrari in whose hands they were close to Bukhara.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></p>

<p>It groups scattered information to recall that Salim (Jahangir) was
‘Abdu’r-rahim’s ward, that then, as now, Babur’s Autobiography
was the best example of classic Turki, and that it would appeal on
grounds of piety&mdash;as it did appeal on some sufficient ground&mdash;to
have its broken story made good. Also that for three of the four
“portions” Abu’l-fazl’s concise matter was to hand.</p>

<p class="center">IX</p>

<p>My information concerning Baburiana under Shah-i-jahan Padshah
(1628-58) is very meagre. It consists of (1) his attestation of a
signature of Babur (App. Q and photo), (2) his possession of Babur’s
autograph Codex (<i>Padshah-nama</i>, Bib. Ind. ed., ii, 4), and (3)
his acceptance, and that by his literary entourage, of Mir Abu-talib
<i>Husaini’s</i> Persian translation of Timur’s Annals, the <i>Malfuzat</i>
whose preparation the <i>Zafar-nama</i> describes and whose link with
Babur’s writings is that of the exemplar to the emulator.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></p>

<p class="center">X</p>

<p>The Haidarabad Codex may have been inscribed under Aurang-zib
Padshah (1655-1707). So many particulars about it have been
given already that little needs saying here.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> It was the <i>grande
trouvaille</i> of my search for Turki text wherewith to revive Babur’s
autobiography both in Turki and English. My husband in 1900
saw it in Haidarabad; through the kind offices of the late Sayyid
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlvii" id="Page_xlvii">[Pg xlvii]</a></span>Ali <i>Bilgrami</i> it was lent to me; it proved to surpass, both in volume
and quality, all other Babur-nama MSS. I had traced; I made its
merits known to Professor Edward Granville Browne, just when the
E. J. Wilkinson Gibb Trust was in formation, with the happy and
accordant result that the best prose book in classic Turki became
the first item in the Memorial&mdash;<i>matris ad filium</i>&mdash;of literary work
done in the name of the Turkish scholar, and Babur’s very words
were safeguarded in hundred-fold facsimile. An event so important
for autobiography and for Turki literature may claim more than
the bald mention of its occurrence, because sincere autobiography,
however ancient, is human and social and undying, so that this
was no mere case of multiplying copies of a book, but was one of
preserving a man’s life in his words. There were, therefore, joyful
red-letter days in the English story of the Codex&mdash;outstanding from
others being those on which its merits revealed themselves (on
Surrey uplands)&mdash;the one which brought Professor Browne’s
acceptance of it for reproduction by the Trust&mdash;and the day of
pause from work marked by the accomplished fact of the safety of
the <i>Babur-nama.</i></p>

<p class="center">XI</p>

<p>The period from <i>cir.</i> 1700, the date of the Haidarabad Codex,
and 1810, when the Elphinstone Codex was purchased by its sponsor
at Peshawar, appears to have been unfruitful in work on the
Hindustan MSS. Causes for this may connect with historic events,
<i>e.g.</i> Nadir Shah’s desolation of Dihli and the rise of the East India
Company, and, in Baburiana, with the disappearance of Babur’s
autograph Codex (it was unknown to the Scots of 1800-26), and the
transfer of the Elphinstone Codex from royal possession&mdash;this,
possibly however, an accident of royal travel to and from Kabul at
earlier dates.</p>

<p>The first quarter of the nineteenth century was, on the contrary,
most fruitful in valuable work, useful impulse to which was given
by Dr. John Leyden who in about 1805 began to look into Turki.
Like his contemporary Julius Klaproth (<i>q.v.</i>), he was avid of
tongues and attracted by Turki and by Babur’s writings of which he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlviii" id="Page_xlviii">[Pg xlviii]</a></span>
had some knowledge through the ‘Abdu’r-rahim (Persian) translation.
His Turki text-book would be the MS. of the Asiatic Society
of Bengal,<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> a part-copy of the Bukhara compilation, from which he
had the India Office MS. copied. He took up Turki again in 1810,
after his return from Malay and whilst awaiting orders in Calcutta
for departure to Java. He sailed in the autumn of the year and died
in August 1811. Much can be learned about him and his Turki
occupations from letters (<i>infra</i> xiii) written to Erskine by him and
by others of the Scottish band which now achieved such fine results
for Babur’s Autobiography.</p>

<p>It is necessary to say something of Leyden’s part in producing the
<i>Memoirs</i>, because Erskine, desiring to “lose nothing that might
add to Leyden’s reputation”, has assigned to him an undue position
of collaboration in it both by giving him premier place on its title-page
and by attributing to him the beginning the translation.
What one gleans of Leyden’s character makes an impression of
unassumption that would forbid his acceptance of the posthumous
position given to him, and, as his translation shews the tyro in
Turki, there can be no ground for supposing he would wish his
competence in it over-estimated. He had, as dates show, nothing
to do with the actual work of the <i>Memoirs</i> which was finished
before Erskine had seen in 1813 what Leyden had set down before
he died in 1811. As the <i>Memoirs</i> is now a rare book, I quote
from it what Erskine says (Preface, p. ix) of Leyden’s rough
translation:&mdash;“This acquisition (<i>i.e</i>. of Leyden’s trs.) reduced me
to rather an awkward dilemma. The two translations (his own
and Leyden’s) differed in many important particulars; but as
Dr. Leyden had the advantage of translating from the original,
I resolved to adopt his translation as far as it went, changing
only such expressions in it as seemed evidently to be inconsistent
with the context, or with other parts of the <i>Memoirs</i>, or
such as seemed evidently to originate in the oversights that are
unavoidable in an unfinished work.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> This labour I had completed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlix" id="Page_xlix">[Pg xlix]</a></span>with some difficulty, when Mr. Elphinstone sent me the copy of the
<i>Memoirs of Baber</i> in the original Tūrkī (<i>i.e.</i> The Elphinstone Codex)
which he had procured when he went to Peshawar on his embassy
to Kabul. This copy, which he had supposed to have been sent
with Dr. Leyden’s manuscripts from Calcutta, he was now fortunate
enough to recover (in his own library at Poona). “The discovery
of this valuable manuscript reduced me, though heartily sick of the
task, to the necessity of commencing my work once more.”</p>

<p>Erskine’s Preface (pp. x, xi) contains various other references to
Leyden’s work which indicate its quality as tentative and unrevised.
It is now in the British Museum Library.</p>

<p class="center">XII</p>

<p>Little need be said here about the <i>Memoirs of Baber</i>.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> Erskine
worked on a basis of considerable earlier acquaintance with his
Persian original, for, as his Preface tells, he had (after Leyden’s
death) begun to translate this some years before he definitely
accepted the counsel of Elphinstone and Malcolm to undertake
the <i>Memoirs</i>. He finished his translation in 1813, and by 1816
was able to dedicate his complete volume to Elphinstone, but
publication was delayed till 1826. His was difficult pioneer-work,
and carried through with the drawback of working on a secondary
source. It has done yeoman service, of which the crowning merit
is its introduction of Babur’s autobiography to the Western world.</p>

<p class="center">XIII</p>

<p>Amongst Erskine’s literary remains are several bound volumes of
letters from Elphinstone, Malcolm, Leyden, and others of that
distinguished group of Scots who promoted the revival of Babur’s
writings. Erskine’s grandson, the late Mr. Lestocq Erskine, placed
these, with other papers, at our disposal, and they are now located
where they have been welcomed as appropriate additions:&mdash;Elphinstone’s
are in the Advocates’ Library, where already (1826) he,
through Erskine, had deposited his own Codex&mdash;and with his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_l" id="Page_l">[Pg l]</a></span>letters are those of Malcolm and more occasional correspondents;
Leyden’s letters (and various papers) are in the Memorial Cottage
maintained in his birthplace Denholm (Hawick) by the Edinburgh
Border Counties Association; something fitting went to the Bombay
Asiatic Society and a volume of diary to the British Museum.
Leyden’s papers will help his fuller biography; Elphinstone’s letters
have special value as recording his co-operation with Erskine by
much friendly criticism, remonstrance against delay, counsels and
encouragement. They, moreover, shew the estimate an accomplished
man of modern affairs formed of Babur Padshah’s character
and conduct; some have been quoted in Colebrooke’s <i>Life of
Elphinstone</i>, but there they suffer by detachment from the rest of
his Baburiana letters; bound together as they now are, and with
brief explanatory interpolations, they would make a welcome item
for “Babur Padshah’s Book-pile”.</p>

<p class="center">XIV</p>

<p>In May 1921 the contents of these volumes were completed, namely,
the <i>Babur-nama in English</i> and its supplements, the aims of which
are to make Babur known in English diction answering to his
<i>ipsissima verba</i>, and to be serviceable to readers and students of
his book and of classic Turki.</p>

<p class="center"><b>Part III. The “Bukhara Babur-nama”.</b></p>

<p>This is a singular book and has had a career as singular as its
characteristics, a very comedy of (blameless) errors and mischance.
For it is a compilation of items diverse in origin, diction, and age,
planned to be a record of the Acts of Babur and Humayun, dependent
through its Babur portion on the ‘Abdu’r-rahim Persian translation
for re-translation, or verbatim quotation, or dove-tailing effected on
the tattered fragments of what had once been Kamran’s Codex of
the Babur-nama proper, the whole interspersed by stop-gaps attributable
to Jahangir. These and other specialities notwithstanding, it
ranked for nearly 200 years as a reproduction of Babur’s authentic
text, as such was sent abroad, as such was reconstructed and
printed in Kasan (1857), translated in Paris (1871), catalogued for
the Petrograd Oriental School (1894), and for the India Office (1903).<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></p>

<p>Manifest causes for the confusion of identity are, (1) lack of the
guidance in Bukhara and Petrograd of collation with the true text,
(2) want of information, in the Petrograd of 1700-25, about Babur’s
career, coupled with the difficulties of communication with Bukhara,
(3) the misleading feature in the compiled book of its author’s
retention of the autobiographic form of his sources, without explanation
as to whether he entered surviving fragments of Kamran’s
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lii" id="Page_lii">[Pg lii]</a></span>Codex, patchings or extracts from ‘Abdu’r-rahim’s Persian translation,
or quotations of Jahangir’s stop-gaps. Of these three causes
for error the first is dominant, entailing as it does the drawbacks
besetting work on an inadequate basis.</p>

<p>It is necessary to enumerate the items of the Compilation here
as they are arranged in Kehr’s autograph Codex, because that codex
(still in London) may not always be accessible,<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> and because the
imprint does not obey its model, but aims at closer agreement of the
Bukhara Compilation with Ilminski’s gratefully acknowledged
guide&mdash;<i>The Memoirs of Baber</i>. Distinction in commenting on the
Bukhara and the Kasan versions is necessary; their discrepancy
is a scene in the comedy of errors.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_liii" id="Page_liii">[Pg liii]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Outline of the History of the Compilation.</span></p>

<p>An impelling cause for the production of the Bukhara compilation
is suggested by the date 1709 at which was finished the earliest
example known to me. For in the first decade of the eighteenth
century Peter the Great gave attention to Russian relations with
foreign states of Central Asia and negociated with the Khan of
Bukhara for the reception of a Russian mission.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> Political aims
would be forwarded if envoys were familiar with Turki; books
in that tongue for use in the School of Oriental Languages would
be desired; thus the Compilation may have been prompted and,
as will be shown later, it appears to have been produced, and not
merely copied, in 1709. The Mission’s despatch was delayed till
1719;<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> it arrived in Bukhara in 1721; during its stay a member of
its secretariat bought a Compilation MS. noted as finished in 1714
and on a fly-leaf of it made the following note:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_liv" id="Page_liv">[Pg liv]</a></span></p>

<p>“<i>I, Timur-pulad son of Mirza Rajab son of Pay-chin, bought this
book Babur-nama after coming to Bukhara with [the] Russian Florio
Beg Beneveni, envoy of the Padshah ... whose army is numerous as
the stars.... May it be well received! Amen! O Lord of both
Worlds!</i>”</p>

<p>Timur-pulad’s hope for a good reception indicates a definite
recipient, perhaps a commissioned purchase. The vendor may have
been asked for a history of Babur; he sold one, but “Babur-nama”
is not necessarily a title, and is not suitable for the
Compilation; by conversational mischance it may have seemed so
to the purchaser and thus have initiated the mistake of confusing
the “Bukhara Babur-nama” with the true one.</p>

<p>Thus endorsed, the book in 1725 reached the Foreign Office;
there in 1737 it was obtained by George Jacob Kehr, a teacher of
Turki, amongst other languages, in the Oriental School, who copied
it with meticulous care, understanding its meaning imperfectly,
in order to produce a Latin version of it. His Latin rendering was
a fiasco, but his reproduction of the Arabic forms of his archetype
was so obedient that on its sole basis Ilminski edited the Kasan
Imprint (1857). A collateral copy of the Timur-pulad Codex was
made in 1742 (as has been said).</p>

<p>In 1824 Klaproth (who in 1810 had made a less valuable extract
perhaps from Kehr’s Codex) copied from the Timur-pulad MS.
its purchaser’s note, the Auzbeg?(?) endorsement as to the transfer
of the “Kamran-docket” and Babur’s letter to Kamran (<i>Mémoires
relatifs &agrave; l’Asie</i> Paris).</p>

<p>In 1857 Ilminski, working in Kasan, produced his imprint, which
became de Courteille’s source for <i>Les Mémoires de Baber</i> in 1871.
No worker in the above series shews doubt about accepting the
Compilation as containing Babur’s authentic text. Ilminski was
in the difficult position of not having entire reliance on Kehr’s
transcription, a natural apprehension in face of the quality of the
Latin version, his doubts sum up into his words that a reliable
text could not be made from his source (Kehr’s MS.), but that a
Turki reading-book could&mdash;and was. As has been said, he did not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lv" id="Page_lv">[Pg lv]</a></span>
obey the dual plan of the Compilation Kehr’s transcript reveals,
this, perhaps, because of the misnomer Babur-nama under which
Timur-pulad’s Codex had come to Petrograd; this, certainly,
because he thought a better history of Babur could be produced
by following Erskine than by obeying Kehr&mdash;a series of errors
following the verbal mischance of 1725. Ilminski’s transformation
of the items of his source had the ill result of misleading Pavet de
Courteille to over-estimate his Turki source at the expense of
Erskine’s Persian one which, as has been said, was Ilminski’s guide&mdash;another
scene in the comedy. A mischance hampering the French
work was its falling to be done at a time when, in Paris 1871, there
can have been no opportunity available for learning the contents of
Ilminski’s Russian Preface or for quiet research and the examination
of collateral aids from abroad.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Author of the Compilation.</span></p>

<p>The Haidarabad Codex having destroyed acquiescence in the
phantasmal view of the Bukhara book, the question may be considered,
who was its author?</p>

<p>This question a convergence of details about the Turki MSS.
reputed to contain the <i>Babur-nama</i>, now allows me to answer with
some semblance of truth. Those details have thrown new light
upon a colophon which I received in 1900 from Mr. C. Salemann
with other particulars concerning the “<i>Senkovski Babur-nama</i>,”
this being an extract from the Compilation; its archetype reached
Petrograd from Bukhara a century after Kehr’s [<i>viz.</i> the Timur-pulad
Codex]; it can be taken as a direct copy of the Mulla’s
original because it bears his colophon.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> In 1900 I accepted it as
merely that of a scribe who had copied Senkovski’s archetype, but
in 1921 reviewing the colophon for this Preface, it seems to me to
be that of the original autograph MS. of the Compilation and to
tell its author’s name, his title for his book, and the year (1709) in
which he completed it.</p>

<p>Senkovski brought it over from his archetype; Mr. Salemann

<p>“<i>Known and entitled Waqi‘nama-i-padshahi (Record of Royal
Acts), [this] autograph and composition (bayad u navisht) of Mulla
‘Abdu’l-wahhāb the Teacher, of Ghaj-davan in Bukhara&mdash;God pardon
his mistakes and the weakness of his endeavour!&mdash;was finished on
Monday, Rajab 5, 1121</i> (Aug. 31st, 1709).<i>&mdash;Thank God!</i>”</p>

<p>It will be observed that the title Waqi‘nama-i-padshahi suits the
plan of dual histories (of Babur and Humayun) better than does the
“Babur-nama” of Timur-pulad’s note, that the colophon does
not claim for the Mulla to have copied the elder book (1494-1530)
but to have written down and composed one under a differing title
suiting its varied contents; that the Mulla’s deprecation and thanks
tone better with perplexing work, such as his was, than with the
steadfast patience of a good scribe; and that it exonerates the
Mulla from suspicion of having caused his compilation to be accepted
as Babur’s authentic text. Taken with its circumstanding matters,
it may be the dénoument of the play.</p>

<small>THE LEYDEN AND ERSKINE MEMOIRS OF BABER.</small></h3>

<p>The fame and long literary services of the <i>Memoirs of Baber</i>
compel me to explain why these volumes of mine contain a verbally
new English translation of the <i>Babur-nama</i> instead of a second
edition of the <i>Memoirs</i>. My explanation is the simple one of textual
values, of the advantage a primary source has over its derivative,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lviii" id="Page_lviii">[Pg lviii]</a></span>
Babur’s original text over its Persian translation which alone was
accessible to Erskine.</p>

<p>If the <i>Babur-nama</i> owed its perennial interest to its valuable
multifarious matter, the <i>Memoirs</i> could suffice to represent it, but
this it does not; what has kept interest in it alive through some
four centuries is the autobiographic presentment of an arresting
personality its whole manner, style and diction produce. It is
characteristic throughout, from first to last making known the
personal quality of its author. Obviously that quality has the better
chance of surviving a transfer of Babur’s words to a foreign tongue
when this can be effected by imitation of them. To effect this was
impracticable to Erskine who did not see any example of the Turki
text during the progress of his translation work and had little
acquaintance with Turki. No blame attaches to his results; they
have been the one introduction of Babur’s writings to English readers
for almost a century; but it would be as sensible to expect a potter
to shape a vessel for a specific purpose without a model as a translator
of autobiography to shape the new verbal container for Babur’s
quality without seeing his own. Erskine was the pioneer amongst
European workers on Baburiana&mdash;Leyden’s fragment of unrevised
attempt to translate the Bukhara Compilation being a negligible
matter, notwithstanding friendship’s deference to it; he had ready
to his hand no such valuable collateral help as he bequeathed to his
successors in the Memoirs volume. To have been able to help in
the renewal of his book by preparing a second edition of it, revised
under the authority of the Haidarabad Codex, would have been to
me an act of literary piety to an old book-friend; I experimented
and failed in the attempt; the wording of the Memoirs would not
press back into the Turki mould. Being what it is, sound in its
matter and partly representative of Babur himself, the all-round
safer plan, one doing it the greater honour, was to leave it unshorn
of its redundance and unchanged in its wording, in the place of
worth and dignity it has held so long.</p>

<p>Brought to this point by experiment and failure, the way lay open
to make bee-line over intermediaries back to the fountain-head of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lix" id="Page_lix">[Pg lix]</a></span>
re-discovered Turki text preserved in the Haidarabad Codex. Thus
I have enjoyed an advantage no translator has had since ‘Abdu’r-rahim
in 1589.</p>

<p>Concerning matters of style and diction, I may mention that three
distinct impressions of Babur’s personality are set by his own,
Erskine’s and de Courteille’s words and manner. These divergencies,
while partly due to differing textual bases, may result mainly from
the use by the two Europeans of unsifted, current English and
French. Their portrayal might have been truer, there can be no
doubt, if each had restricted himself to such under-lying component
of his mother-tongue as approximates in linguistic stature to classic
Turki. This probability Erskine could not foresee for, having no
access during his work to a Turki source and no familiarity with
Turki, he missed their lessoning.</p>

<p>Turki, as Babur writes it&mdash;terse, word-thrifty, restrained and lucid,&mdash;comes
over neatly into Anglo-Saxon English, perhaps through
primal affinities. Studying Babur’s writings in verbal detail taught
me that its structure, idiom and vocabulary dictate a certain
mechanism for a translator’s imitation. Such are the simple sentence,
devoid of relative phrasing, copied in the form found, whether abrupt
and brief or, ranging higher with the topic, gracious and dignified&mdash;the
retention of Babur’s use of “we” and “I” and of his frequent
impersonal statement&mdash;the matching of words by their root-notion&mdash;the
strict observance of Babur’s limits of vocabulary, effected by
allotting to one Turki word one English equivalent, thus excluding
synonyms for which Turki has little use because not shrinking from
the repeated word; lastly, as preserving relations of diction, the
replacing of Babur’s Arabic and Persian aliens by Greek and Latin
ones naturalized in English. Some of these aids towards shaping a
counterpart of Turki may be thought small, but they obey a model
and their aggregate has power to make or mar a portrait.</p>

<p>(1) Of the uses of pronouns it may be said that Babur’s “we” is
neither regal nor self-magnifying but is co-operative, as beseems the
chief whose volunteer and nomad following makes or unmakes his
power, and who can lead and command only by remittent consent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lx" id="Page_lx">[Pg lx]</a></span>
accorded to him. His “I” is individual. The <i>Memoirs</i> varies
much from these uses.</p>

<p>(2) The value of reproducing impersonal statements is seen by
the following example, one of many similar:&mdash;When Babur and a
body of men, making a long saddle-journey, halted for rest and
refreshment by the road-side; “There was drinking,” he writes, but
Erskine, “I drank”; what is likely being that all or all but a few
shared the local <i>vin du pays</i>.</p>

<p>(3) The importance of observing Babur’s limits of vocabulary
needs no stress, since any man of few words differs from any man of
many. Measured by the Babur-nama standard, the diction of the
<i>Memoirs</i> is redundant throughout, and frequently over-coloured. Of
this a pertinent example is provided by a statement of which a
minimum of seven occurrences forms my example, namely, that such
or such a man whose life Babur sketches was vicious or a vicious
person (<i>fisq</i>, <i>fāsiq</i>). Erskine once renders the word by “vicious”
but elsewhere enlarges to “debauched, excess of sensual enjoyment,
lascivious, libidinous, profligate, voluptuous”. The instances are
scattered and certainly Erskine could not feel their collective effect,
but even scattered, each does its ill-part in distorting the Memoirs
portraiture of the man of the one word.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Postscript of Thanks.</span></h3>

<p>I take with gratitude the long-delayed opportunity of finishing my
book to express the obligation I feel to the Council of the Royal
Asiatic Society for allowing me to record in the Journal my Notes on
the Turki Codices of the <i>Babur-nama</i> begun in 1900 and occasionally
appearing till 1921. In minor convenience of work, to be able to
gather those progressive notes together and review them, has been of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxi" id="Page_lxi">[Pg lxi]</a></span>value to me in noticeable matters, two of which are the finding and
multiplying of the Haidarabad Codex, and the definite clearance of the
confusion which had made the Bukhara (reputed) <i>Babur-nama</i> be
mistaken for a reproduction of Babur’s true text.</p>

<p>Immeasurable indeed is the obligation laid on me by the happy
community of interests which brought under our roof the translation
of the biographies of Babur, Humayun, and Akbar. What this has
meant to my own work may be surmised by those who know my
husband’s wide reading in many tongues of East and West, his
retentive memory and his generous communism in knowledge. One
signal cause for gratitude to him from those caring for Baburiana, is
that it was he made known the presence of the Haidarabad Codex
in its home library (1899) and thus led to its preservation in facsimile.</p>

<p>It would be impracticable to enumerate all whose help I keep in
grateful memory and realize as the fruit of the genial camaraderie of
letters.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap lowercase">AH.—Oct. 12th 1493 to Oct. 2nd 1494 AD.</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span><a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> the month of Ramẓān of the year 899 (June 1494) and<span class="sidenote">Ḥaidarābād<br />MS.&nbsp;fol.<br />1b.</span>
in the twelfth year of my age,<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> I became ruler<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> in the country of
Farghāna.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>a. Description of Farghāna.</i>)</p>

<p>Farghāna is situated in the fifth climate<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> and at the limit of
settled habitation. On the east it has Kāshghar; on the
west, Samarkand; on the south, the mountains of the
Badakhshān border; on the north, though in former times
there must have been towns such as Ālmālīgh, Ālmātū and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>Yāngī which in books they write Tarāz,<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> at the present time
all is desolate, no settled population whatever remaining,
because of the Mughūls and the Aūzbegs.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></p>

<p>Farghāna is a small country,<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> abounding in grain and fruits.
It is girt round by mountains except on the west, <i>i.e.</i> towards
Khujand and Samarkand, and in winter<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> an enemy can enter
only on that side.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;2.</span>The Saiḥūn River (<i>daryā</i>) commonly known as the Water
of Khujand, comes into the country from the north-east, flows
westward through it and after passing along the north of
Khujand and the south of Fanākat,<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> now known as Shāhrukhiya,
turns directly north and goes to Turkistān. It does not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>join any sea<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> but sinks into the sands, a considerable distance
below [the town of] Turkistān.</p>

<p>Farghāna has seven separate townships,<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> five on the south
and two on the north of the Saiḥūn.</p>

<p>Of those on the south, one is Andijān. It has a central
position and is the capital of the Farghāna country. It produces
much grain, fruits in abundance, excellent grapes and
melons. In the melon season, it is not customary to sell them
out at the beds.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> Better than the Andijān <i>nāshpātī</i>,<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> there is
none. After Samarkand and Kesh, the fort<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> of Andijān is the
largest in Mawārā’u’n-nahr (Transoxiana). It has three gates.
Its citadel (<i>ark</i>) is on its south side. Into it water goes by
nine channels; out of it, it is strange that none comes at even
a single place.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> Round the outer edge of the ditch<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> runs a
gravelled highway; the width of this highway divides the fort
from the suburbs surrounding it.</p>

<p>Andijān has good hunting and fowling; its pheasants grow
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>so surprisingly fat that rumour has it four people could not
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;2b.</span>finish one they were eating with its stew.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a></p>

<p>Andijānīs are all Turks, not a man in town or bāzār but
knows Turkī. The speech of the people is correct for the pen;
hence the writings of Mīr ‘Alī-shīr <i>Nawā’ī</i>,<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> though he was bred
and grew up in Hīrī (Harāt), are one with their dialect. Good
looks are common amongst them. The famous musician,
Khwāja Yūsuf, was an Andijānī.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> The climate is malarious;
in autumn people generally get fever.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></p>

<p>Again, there is Aūsh (Ūsh), to the south-east, inclining to
east, of Andijān and distant from it four <i>yīghāch</i> by road.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> It
has a fine climate, an abundance of running waters<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> and a
most beautiful spring season. Many traditions have their rise
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>in its excellencies.<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> To the south-east of the walled town
(<i>qūrghān</i>) lies a symmetrical mountain, known as the Barā
Koh;<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> on the top of this, Sl. Maḥmūd Khān built a retreat
(<i>ḥajra</i>) and lower down, on its shoulder, I, in 902<span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (1496<span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>)
built another, having a porch. Though his lies the higher,
mine is the better placed, the whole of the town and the suburbs
being at its foot.</p>

<p>The Andijān torrent<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> goes to Andijān after having traversed<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;3.</span>
the suburbs of Aūsh. Orchards (<i>bāghāt</i>)<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> lie along both its
banks; all the Aūsh gardens (<i>bāghlār</i>) overlook it; their
violets are very fine; they have running waters and in spring
are most beautiful with the blossoming of many tulips and roses.</p>

<p>On the skirt of the Barā-koh is a mosque called the Jauza
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>Masjid (Twin Mosque).<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> Between this mosque and the town,
a great main canal flows from the direction of the hill. Below
the outer court of the mosque lies a shady and delightful clover-meadow
where every passing traveller takes a rest. It is the
joke of the ragamuffins of Aūsh to let out water from the
canal<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> on anyone happening to fall asleep in the meadow. A
very beautiful stone, waved red and white<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> was found in the
Barā Koh in ‘Umar Shaikh Mīrzā’s latter days; of it are made
knife handles, and clasps for belts and many other things.
For climate and for pleasantness, no township in all Farghāna
equals Aūsh.</p>

<p>Again there is Marghīnān; seven <i>yīghāch</i><a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> by road to the west
of Andijān,&mdash;a fine township full of good things. Its apricots
(<i>aūrūk</i>) and pomegranates are most excellent. One sort of
pomegranate, they call the Great Seed (<i>Dāna-i-kalān</i>); its
sweetness has a little of the pleasant flavour of the small apricot
(<i>zard-alū</i>) and it may be thought better than the Semnān pomegranate.
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;3b.</span>Another kind of apricot (<i>aūrūk</i>) they dry after stoning
it and putting back the kernel;<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> they then call it <i>subḥānī</i>; it is
very palatable. The hunting and fowling of Marghīnān are
good; <i>āq kīyīk</i><a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> are had close by. Its people are Sārts,<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> boxers,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>noisy and turbulent. Most of the noted bullies (<i>jangralār</i>) of
Samarkand and Bukhārā are Marghīnānīs. The author of the
Hidāyat<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> was from Rashdān, one of the villages of Marghīnān.</p>

<p>Again there is Asfara, in the hill-country and nine <i>yīghāch</i><a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a>
by road south-west of Marghīnān. It has running waters,
beautiful little gardens (<i>bāghcha</i>) and many fruit-trees but
almonds for the most part in its orchards. Its people are all
Persian-speaking<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> Sārts. In the hills some two miles (<i>bīrshar‘ī</i>)
to the south of the town, is a piece of rock, known as the Mirror
Stone.<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> It is some 10 arm-lengths (<i>qārī</i>) long, as high as a man
in parts, up to his waist in others. Everything is reflected by it
as by a mirror. The Asfara district (<i>wilāyat</i>) is in four subdivisions
(<i>balūk</i>) in the hill-country, one Asfara, one Warūkh,
one Sūkh and one Hushyār. When Muḥammad <i>Shaibānī</i>
Khān defeated Sl. Maḥmūd Khān and Alacha Khān and took
Tāshkīnt and Shāhrukhiya,<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> I went into the Sūkh and Hushyār<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;4.</span>
hill-country and from there, after about a year spent in great
misery, I set out <i>(‘azīmat</i>) for Kābul.<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a></p>

<p>Again there is Khujand,<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> twenty-five <i>yīghāch</i> by road to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>west of Andijān and twenty-five <i>yīghāch</i> east of Samarkand.<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a>
Khujand is one of the ancient towns; of it were Shaikh Maṣlaḥat
and Khwāja Kamāl.<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> Fruit grows well there; its pomegranates
are renowned for their excellence; people talk of a Khujand
pomegranate as they do of a Samarkand apple; just now however,
Marghīnān pomegranates are much met with.<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> The
walled town (<i>qūrghān</i>) of Khujand stands on high ground; the
Saiḥūn River flows past it on the north at the distance, may
be, of an arrow’s flight.<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> To the north of both the town and
the river lies a mountain range called Munūghul;<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> people say
there are turquoise and other mines in it and there are many
snakes. The hunting and fowling-grounds of Khujand are
first-rate; <i>āq kīyīk</i>,<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> <i>būghū-marāl</i>,<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> pheasant and hare are all
had in great plenty. The climate is very malarious; in autumn
there is much fever;<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> people rumour it about that the very
sparrows get fever and say that the cause of the malaria is the
mountain range on the north (<i>i.e.</i> Munūghul).</p>

<p>Kand-i-badām (Village of the Almond) is a dependency of
Khujand; though it is not a township (<i>qaṣba</i>) it is rather a good
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>approach to one (<i>qaṣbacha</i>). Its almonds are excellent, hence
its name; they all go to Hormuz or to Hindūstān. It is five or<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;4b.</span>
six <i>yīghāch</i><a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> east of Khujand.</p>

<p>Between Kand-i-badām and Khujand lies the waste known as
Hā Darwesh. In this there is always (<i>hamesha</i>) wind; from it
wind goes always (<i>hameshā</i>) to Marghīnān on its east; from it
wind comes continually (<i>dā’im</i>) to Khujand on its west.<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> It has
violent, whirling winds. People say that some darweshes, encountering
a whirlwind in this desert,<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> lost one another and
kept crying, “Hāy Darwesh! Hāy Darwesh!” till all had perished,
and that the waste has been called Hā Darwesh ever since.</p>

<p>Of the townships on the north of the Saiḥūn River one is
Akhsī. In books they write it Akhsīkīt<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> and for this reason the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>poet As̤iru-d-dīn is known as <i>Akhsīkītī</i>. After Andijān no township
in Farghāna is larger than Akhsī. It is nine <i>yīghāch</i><a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> by
road to the west of Andijān. ‘Umar Shaikh Mīrzā made it his
capital.<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> The Saiḥūn River flows below its walled town
(<i>qūrghān</i>). This stands above a great ravine (<i>buland jar</i>) and it
has deep ravines (<i>‘uṃiq jarlār</i>) in place of a moat. When ‘Umar
Shaikh Mīrzā made it his capital, he once or twice cut other
ravines from the outer ones. In all Farghāna no fort is so
strong as Akhsī. *Its suburbs extend some two miles further
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;5.</span>than the walled town.* People seem to have made of Akhsī the
saying (<i>mis̤al</i>), “Where is the village? Where are the trees?”
(<i>Dih kujā? Dirakhtān kujā?</i>) Its melons are excellent; they
call one kind Mīr Tīmūrī; whether in the world there is another
to equal it is not known. The melons of Bukhārā are famous;
when I took Samarkand, I had some brought from there and
some from Akhsī; they were cut up at an entertainment and
nothing from Bukhārā compared with those from Akhsī. The
fowling and hunting of Akhsī are very good indeed; <i>āq kīyīk</i>
abound in the waste on the Akhsī side of the Saihūn; in the
jungle on the Andijān side <i>būghū-marāl</i>,<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> pheasant and hare are
had, all in very good condition.</p>

<p>Again there is Kāsān, rather a small township to the north
of Akhsī. From Kāsān the Akhsī water comes in the same way
as the Andijān water comes from Aūsh. Kāsān has excellent
air and beautiful little gardens (<i>bāghcha</i>). As these gardens all
lie along the bed of the torrent (<i>sā’ī</i>) people call them the “fine
front of the coat.”<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> Between Kāsānīs and Aūshīs there is rivalry
about the beauty and climate of their townships.</p>

<p>In the mountains round Farghāna are excellent summer-pastures
(<i>yīlāq</i>). There, and nowhere else, the <i>tabalghū</i><a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a>grows,
a tree (<i>yīghāch</i>) with red bark; they make staves of it; they<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;5b.</span>
make bird-cages of it; they scrape it into arrows;<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> it is an

(<i>i.e.</i> <i>āyīq aūtī</i>). There are turquoise and iron mines in these

<p>If people do justly, three or four thousand men<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> may be maintained

<p>As ‘Umar Shaikh Mīrzā was a ruler of high ambition and great
pretension, he was always bent on conquest. On several
occasions he led an army against Samarkand; sometimes he
was beaten, sometimes retired against his will.<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> More than
once he asked his father-in-law into the country, that is to say,
my grandfather, Yūnas Khān, the then Khān of the Mughūls
in the camping ground (<i>yūrt</i>) of his ancestor, Chaghatāī Khān,
the second son of Chīngīz Khān. Each time the Mīrzā brought
The Khān into the Farghāna country he gave him lands, but,
partly owing to his misconduct, partly to the thwarting of the
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;6.</span>Mughūls,<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> things did not go as he wished and Yūnas Khān, not
being able to remain, went out again into Mughūlistān. When
the Mīrzā last brought The Khān in, he was in possession of</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p><p>Tāshkīnt, which in books they write Shash, and sometimes
Chāch, whence the term, a Chāchī, bow.<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> He gave it to The
Khān, and from that date (890<span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1485<span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>) down to 908<span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>
(1503<span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>) it and the Shāhrukhiya country were held by the
Chaghatāī Khāns.</p>

<p>At this date (<i>i.e.</i>, 899<span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1494<span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>) the Mughūl Khānship
was in Sl. Maḥ=mūd Khān, Yūnas Khān’s younger son and a
half-brother of my mother. As he and ‘Umar Shaikh Mīrzā’s
elder brother, the then ruler of Samarkand, Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā
were offended by the Mīrzā’s behaviour, they came to an agreement
together; Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā had already given a daughter
to Sl. Maḥmūd Khān;<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a> both now led their armies against
‘Umar Shaikh Mīrzā, the first advancing along the south of
the Khujand Water, the second along its north.</p>

<p>Meantime a strange event occurred. It has been mentioned<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;6b</span>
that the fort of Akhsī is situated above a deep ravine;<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> along
this ravine stand the palace buildings, and from it, on Monday,
Ramẓān 4, (June 8th.) ‘Umar Shaikh Mīrzā flew, with his
pigeons and their house, and became a falcon.<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a></p>

<p>He was 39 (lunar) years old, having been born in Samarkand,
in 860<span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (1456<span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>) He was Sl. Abū-sa‘īd Mīrzā’s fourth
son,<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> being younger than Sl. Aḥmad M. and Sl. Muḥammad
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>M. and Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā. His father, Sl. Abū-sa‘īd Mīrzā,
was the son of Sl. Muḥammad Mīrzā, son of Tīmūr Beg’s third
son, Mīrān-shāh M. and was younger than ‘Umar Shaikh Mīrzā,
(the elder) and Jahāngīr M. but older than Shāhrukh Mīrzā.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>c. ‘Umar Shaikh Mīrzā’s country.</i></p>

<p>His father first gave him Kābul and, with Bābā-i-Kābulī<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> for
his guardian, had allowed him to set out, but recalled him from
the Tamarisk Valley<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> to Samarkand, on account of the Mīrzās’
Circumcision Feast. When the Feast was over, he gave him
Andijān with the appropriateness that Tīmūr Beg had given
Farghāna (Andijān) to his son, the elder ‘Umar Shaikh Mīrzā.
This done, he sent him off with Khudāī-bīrdī <i>Tūghchī Tīmūr-tāsh</i><a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a>
for his guardian.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>d. His appearance and characteristics.</i></p>

<p>He was a short and stout, round-bearded and fleshy-faced
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;7.</span>person.<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> He used to wear his tunic so very tight that to fasten
the strings he had to draw his belly in and, if he let himself
out after tying them, they often tore away. He was not choice
in dress or food. He wound his turban in a fold (<i>dastar-pech</i>);
all turbans were in four folds (<i>chār-pech</i>) in those days; people
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>wore them without twisting and let the ends hang down.<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> In
the heats and except in his Court, he generally wore the
Mughūl cap.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>e. His qualities and habits.</i></p>

<p>He was a true believer (<i>Ḥanafī maẕhablīk</i>) and pure in the
Faith, not neglecting the Five Prayers and, his life through,
making up his Omissions.<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> He read the Qur’ān very
frequently and was a disciple of his Highness Khwāja
‘Ubaidu’l-lāh (<i>Aḥrārī</i>) who honoured him by visits and
even called him son. His current readings<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a> were the two
Quintets and the <i>Mas̤nawī</i>;<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a> of histories he read chiefly
the <i>Shāh-nāma</i>. He had a poetic nature, but no taste for
composing verses. He was so just that when he heard of a
caravan returning from Khitāī as overwhelmed by snow in
the mountains of Eastern Andijān,<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a> and that of its thousand
heads of houses (<i>awīlūq</i>) two only had escaped, he sent his
overseers to take charge of all goods and, though no heirs were<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;7b.</span>
near and though he was in want himself, summoned the heirs
from Khurāsān and Samarkand, and in the course of a year
or two had made over to them all their property safe and
sound.</p>

<p>He was very generous; in truth, his character rose altogether
to the height of generosity. He was affable, eloquent and
sweet-spoken, daring and bold. Twice out-distancing all his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>braves,<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> he got to work with his own sword, once at the Gate
of Akhsī, once at the Gate of Shāhrukhiya. A middling archer,
he was strong in the fist,&mdash;not a man but fell to his blow.
Through his ambition, peace was exchanged often for war,
friendliness for hostility.</p>

<p>In his early days he was a great drinker, later on used to have
a party once or twice a week. He was good company, on
occasions reciting verses admirably. Towards the last he
rather preferred intoxicating confects<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a> and, under their sway,
used to lose his head. His disposition<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> was amorous, and he
bore many a lover’s mark.<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> He played draughts a good deal,
sometimes even threw the dice.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>f. His battles and encounters.</i></p>

<p>He fought three ranged battles, the first with Yūnas Khān,
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;8.</span>on the Saiḥūn, north of Andijān, at the Goat-leap,<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> a village
so-called because near it the foot-hills so narrow the flow of
the water that people say goats leap across.<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a> There he was
beaten and made prisoner. Yūnas Khān for his part did well
by him and gave him leave to go to his own district (Andijān).
This fight having been at that place, the Battle of the Goat-leap
became a date in those parts.</p>

<p>His second battle was fought on the Urūs,<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> in Turkistān, with
Aūzbegs returning from a raid near Samarkand. He crossed
the river on the ice, gave them a good beating, separated off all
their prisoners and booty and, without coveting a single thing
for himself, gave everything back to its owners.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p><p>His third battle he fought with (his brother) Sl. Aḥmad
Mīrzā at a place between Shāhrukhiya and Aūrā-tīpā, named
Khwāṣ.<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a> Here he was beaten.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>g. His country.</i></p>

<p>The Farghāna country his father had given him; Tāshkīnt
and Sairām, his elder brother, Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā gave, and
they were in his possession for a time; Shāhrukhiya he took
by a ruse and held awhile. Later on, Tāshkīnt and Shāhrukhiya
passed out of his hands; there then remained the Farghāna
country and Khujand,&mdash;some do not include Khujand in<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;8b.</span>
Farghāna,&mdash;and Aūrā-tīpā, of which the original name was
Aūrūshnā and which some call Aūrūsh. In Aūrā-tīpā, at the
time Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā went to Tāshkīnt against the Mughūls,
and was beaten on the Chīr<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a> (893<span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1488<span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>) was Ḥafiẓ Beg
<i>Dūldāī</i>; he made it over to ‘Umar Shaikh M. and the Mīrzā
held it from that time forth.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>h. His children.</i></p>

<p>Three of his sons and five of his daughters grew up. I,
Z̤ahīru’d-dīn Muḥammad Bābur,<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a> was his eldest son; my
mother was Qūtlūq-nigār Khānīm. Jahāngīr Mīrzā was his
second son, two years younger than I; his mother, Fāt̤ima-sult̤ān
by name, was of the Mughūl <i>tūmān</i>-begs.<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a> Nāṣir Mīrzā

named Umīd. He was four years younger than I.</p>

<p>‘Umar Shaikh Mīrzā’s eldest daughter was Khān-zāda
Begīm,<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a> my full sister, five years older than I. The second

Sar-i-pul,<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a> I went back and held it through a five months’ siege,
but as no sort of help or reinforcement came from any beg or
ruler thereabouts, I left it in despair and got away; in that
throneless time (<i>fatrat</i>) Khān-zāda Begīm fell<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> to Muḥammad
<i>Shaibānī</i> Khān. She had one child by him, a pleasant boy,<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a>
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;9.</span>named Khurram Shāh. The Balkh country was given to
him; he went to God’s mercy a few years after the death of
his father (916<span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1510<span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>). Khān-zāda Begīm was in Merv
when Shāh Ismā‘īl (<i>Ṣafawī</i>) defeated the Aūzbegs near that
town (916<span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1510<span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>); for my sake he treated her well, giving
her a sufficient escort to Qūndūz where she rejoined me. We
had been apart for some ten years; when Muḥammadī
<i>kūkūldāsh</i> and I went to see her, neither she nor those about
her knew us, although I spoke. They recognized us after
a time.</p>

<p>Mihr-bānū Begīm was another daughter, Nāṣir Mīrzā’s full-sister,
two years younger than I. Shahr-bānū Begīm was
another, also Nāṣir Mīrzā’s full-sister, eight years younger
than I. Yādgār-sult̤ān Begīm was another, her mother
was a mistress, called Āghā-sult̤ān. Ruqaiya-sult̤ān Begīm
was another; her mother, Makhdūm-sult̤ān Begīm, people
used to call the Dark-eyed Begīm. The last-named two
were born after the Mīrzā’s death. Yādgār-sult̤ān Begīm was
brought up by my grandmother, Aīsān-daulat Begīm; she fell
to ‘Abdu’l-lat̤īf Sl., a son of Ḥamza Sl. when Shaibānī Khān
took Andijān and Akhsī (908<span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1503<span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>). She rejoined me
when (917<span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1511<span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>) in Khutlān I defeated Ḥamza Sl. and
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;9b.</span>other sult̤āns and took Ḥiṣār. Ruqaiya-sult̤ān Begīm fell in that

<p>Yūnas Khān (d. 892 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1487 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>) and Aīsān-būghā Khān
(d. 866 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1462 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>) were sons of Wais Khān (d. 832 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1428

grand-daughter of Shaikh Nūru’d-dīn Beg, a Turkistānī
Qīpchāq favoured by Tīmūr Beg. When Wais Khān died, the
Mughūl horde split in two, one portion being for Yūnas Khān,
the greater for Aīsān-būghā Khān. For help in getting the
upper hand in the horde, Aīrzīn (var. Aīrāzān) one of the
Bārīn <i>tūmān</i>-begs and Beg Mīrik <i>Turkmān</i>, one of the Chīrās
<i>tūmān</i>-begs, took Yūnas Khān (aet. 13) and with him<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;10.</span>
three or four thousand Mughūl heads of houses (<i>awīlūq</i>), to
Aūlūgh Beg Mīrzā (<i>Shāhrukhī</i>) with the fittingness that Aūlūgh
Beg M. had taken Yūnas Khān’s elder sister for his son, ‘Abdu’l-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>‘azīz Mīrzā. Aūlūgh Beg Mīrzā did not do well by them;

one. The Dispersion of Aīrzīn became a date in the Mughūl
horde.</p>

<p>Yūnas Khān himself was made to go towards ‘Irāq; one
year he spent in Tabrīz where Jahān Shāh <i>Barānī</i> of the Black
Sheep Turkmāns was ruling. From Tabrīz he went to Shīrāz
where was Shāhrukh Mīrzā’s second son, Ibrāhīm Sult̤ān
Mīrzā.<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> He having died five or six months later (Shawwal 4,

his place. Of this ‘Abdu’l-lāh Mīrzā Yūnas Khān became a
retainer and to him used to pay his respects. The Khān was
in those parts for 17 or 18 years.</p>

<p>In the disturbances between Aūlūgh Beg Mīrzā and his sons,
Aīsān-būghā Khān found a chance to invade Farghāna; he

wife Aīsān-daulat Begīm, the daughter of their chief, ‘Alī-shīr

<p>By this Aīsān-daulat Begīm, Yūnas Khān had three
daughters. Mihr-nigār Khānīm was the eldest; Sl. Abū-sa‘īd
Mīrzā set her aside<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a> for his eldest son, Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā; she
had no child. In a throneless time (905 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>) she fell to
Shaibānī Khān; she left Samarkand<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> with Shāh Begīm for
Khurāsān (907 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>) and both came on to me in Kābul (911 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>).

captured, together with the wives and families of all their

(<i>circa</i> 913 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1507 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>).</p>

<p>Qūtlūq-nigār Khānīm, my mother, was Yūnas Khān’s
second daughter. She was with me in most of my guerilla
expeditions and throneless times. She went to God’s mercy in
Muḥarram 911 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (June 1505 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>) five or six months after the
capture of Kābul.</p>

<p>Khūb-nigār Khānīm was his third daughter. Her they gave
to Muḥammad Ḥusain <i>Kūrkān Dūghlāt</i> (899 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>). She had
one son and one daughter by him. ‘Ubaid Khān (<i>Aūzbeg</i>) took

Her first-born but younger than all Aīsān-daulat Begīm’s

many in and about Samarkand. Next younger than he was
Sl. Aḥmad Khān, known as Alacha Khān. People say he was
called this because he killed many Qālmāqs on the several
occasions he beat them. In the Mughūl and Qālmāq tongues,
one who will kill (<i>aūltūrgūchī</i>) is called <i>ālāchī</i>; Alāchī they
called him therefore and this by repetition, became Alacha.<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a>
As occasion arises, the acts and circumstances of these two
Khāns will find mention in this history (<i>tārīkh</i>).</p>

<p>Sult̤ān-nigār Khānīm was the youngest but one of Yūnas
Khān’s children. Her they made go forth (<i>chīqārīb īdīlār</i>)<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;12.</span>
to Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā; by him she had one child, Sl.
Wais (Khān Mīrzā), mention of whom will come into this
history. When Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā died (900 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1495 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>),
she took her son off to her brothers in Tāshkīnt without a
word to any single person. They, a few years later, gave her
to Adik (Aūng) Sult̤ān,<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a> a Qāzāq sult̤ān of the line of Jūjī Khān,
Chīngīz Khān’s eldest son. When Shaibānī Khān defeated
the Khāns (her brothers), and took Tāshkīnt and Shāhrukhiya
(908 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>), she got away with 10 or 12 of her Mughūl servants,
to (her husband), Adik Sult̤ān. She had two daughters by
Adik Sult̤ān; one she gave to a Shaibān sult̤ān, the other to
Rashīd Sult̤ān, the son of (her cousin) Sl. Sa‘īd Khān. After
Adik Sult̤ān’s death, (his brother), Qāsim Khān, Khān of the

<span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>), spent three or four years in the Badakhshān country,
then went (923 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1420 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>) to Sl. Sa‘īd Khān’s presence in

<p class="indent">(<i>k. Account resumed of Bābur’s father’s family.</i>)</p>

<p>In ‘Umar Shaikh Mīrzā’s <i>ḥaram</i> was also Aūlūs Āghā, a
daughter of Khwāja Ḥusain Beg; her one daughter died in
infancy and they sent her out of the <i>ḥaram</i> a year or eighteen
months later. Fāt̤ima-sult̤ān Āghā was another; she was of
the Mughūl <i>tūmān</i>-begs and the first taken of his wives. Qarāgūz
(Makhdūm sult̤ān) Begīm was another; the Mīrzā took her
towards the end of his life; she was much beloved, so to please
him, they made her out descended from (his uncle) Minūchihr
Mīrzā, the elder brother of Sl. Abū-sa‘īd Mīrzā. He had many
mistresses and concubines; one, Umīd Āghāchā died before
him. Latterly there were also Tūn-sult̤ān (var. Yun) of the
Mughūls and Āghā Sult̤ān.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>l. ‘Umar Shaikh Mīrzā’s Amīrs.</i></p>

<p>There was Khudāī-bīrdī <i>Tūghchī Tīmūr-tāsh</i>, a descendant of
the brother of Āq-būghā Beg, the Governor of Hīrī (Herāt, for
Tīmūr Beg.) When Sl. Abū-sa‘īd Mīrzā, after besieging Jūkī
Mīrzā (<i>Shāhrukhī</i>) in Shāhrukhiya (868<span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1464<span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>) gave the
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;13.</span>Farghāna country to ‘Umar Shaikh Mīrzā, he put this Khudāī-bīrdī

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>then 25 but youth notwithstanding, his rules and management
were very good indeed. A few years later when Ibrāhīm
<i>Begchīk</i> was plundering near Aūsh, he followed him up, fought
him, was beaten and became a martyr. At the time, Sl. Aḥmad
Mīrzā was in the summer pastures of Āq Qāchghāī, in Aūrā-tīpā,
18 <i>yīghāch</i> east of Samarkand, and Sl. Abū-sa‘īd Mīrzā
was at Bābā Khākī, 12 <i>yīghāch</i> east of Hīrī. People sent the
news post-haste to the Mīrzā(s),<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a> having humbly represented it
through ‘Abdu’l-wahhāb <i>Shaghāwal</i>. In four days it was carried
those 120 <i>yīghāch</i> of road.<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a></p>

<p>Ḥāfiẓ Muḥammad Beg <i>Dūldāī</i> was another, Sl. Malik <i>Kāshgharī’s</i>
son and a younger brother of Aḥmad Ḥājī Beg. After
the death of Khudāī-bīrdī Beg, they sent him to control ‘Umar
Shaikh Mīrzā’s Gate, but he did not get on well with the
Andijān begs and therefore, when Sl. Abū-sa‘īd Mīrzā died,
went to Samarkand and took service with Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā.
At the time of the disaster on the Chīr, he was in Aūrā-tīpā
and made it over to ‘Umar Shaikh Mīrzā when the Mīrzā
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;13b.</span>passed through on his way to Samarkand, himself taking
service with him. The Mīrzā, for his part, gave him the
Andijān Command. Later on he went to Sl. Maḥmūd Khān
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>in Tāshkīnt and was there entrusted with the guardianship of
Khān Mīrzā (Wais) and given Dīzak. He had started for Makka
by way of Hind before I took Kābul (910<span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> Oct. 1504<span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>), but
he went to God’s mercy on the road. He was a simple person,
of few words and not clever.</p>

<p>Khwāja Ḥusain Beg was another, a good-natured and simple
person. It is said that, after the fashion of those days, he used
to improvise very well at drinking parties.<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a></p>

<p>Shaikh Mazīd Beg was another, my first guardian, excellent
in rule and method. He must have served (<i>khidmat qīlghān
dūr</i>) under Bābur Mīrzā (<i>Shāhrukhī</i>). There was no greater beg
in ‘Umar Shaikh Mīrzā’s presence. He was a vicious person
and kept catamites.</p>

<p>‘Alī-mazīd <i>Qūchīn</i> was another;<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a> he rebelled twice, once at
Akhsī, once at Tāshkīnt. He was disloyal, untrue to his salt,
vicious and good-for-nothing.</p>

<p>Ḥasan (son of) Yaq‘ūb was another, a small-minded, good-tempered,
smart and active man. This verse is his:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div></div></div>

<p><span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;14.</span>He was brave, a good archer, played polo (<i>chaughān</i>) well and
leapt well at leap-frog.<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a> He had the control of my Gate after
‘Umar Shaikh Mīrzā’s accident. He had not much sense, was
narrow-minded and somewhat of a strife-stirrer.</p>

<p>Qāsim Beg <i>Qūchīn</i>, of the ancient army-begs of Andijān, was
another. He had the control of my Gate after Ḥasan Yaq‘ūb
Beg. His life through, his authority and consequence waxed
without decline. He was a brave man; once he gave some
Aūzbegs a good beating when he overtook them raiding near
Kāsān; his sword hewed away in ‘Umar Shaikh Mīrzā’s
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>presence; and in the fight at the Broad Ford (Yāsī-kījīt <i>circa</i>
904<span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-July, 1499<span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>) he hewed away with the rest. In the
guerilla days he went to Khusrau Shāh (907<span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>) at the time I
was planning to go from the Macha hill-country<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a> to Sl. Maḥmūd
Khān, but he came back to me in 910<span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (1504<span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>) and I shewed
him all my old favour and affection. When I attacked the
Turkmān Hazāra raiders in Dara-i-khwush (911<span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>) he made
better advance, spite of his age, than the younger men; I gave
him Bangash as a reward and later on, after returning to Kābul,
made him Humāyūn’s guardian. He went to God’s mercy<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;14b.</span>
about the time Zamīn-dāwar was taken (<i>circa</i> 928<span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1522<span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>).
He was a pious, God-fearing Musalmān, an abstainer from
doubtful aliments; excellent in judgment and counsel, very
facetious and, though he could neither read nor write (<i>ummiy</i>),
used to make entertaining jokes.</p>

<p>Bābā Beg’s Bābā Qulī (‘Alī) was another, a descendant of
Shaikh ‘Alī <i>Bahādur</i>.<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a> They made him my guardian when
Shaikh Mazīd Beg died. He went over to Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā
when the Mīrzā led his army against Andijān (899<span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>), and
gave him Aūrā-tīpā. After Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā’s death, he left
Samarkand and was on his way to join me (900<span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>) when Sl.
‘Alī Mīrzā, issuing out of Aūrā-tīpā, fought, defeated and slew
him. His management and equipment were excellent and he
took good care of his men. He prayed not; he kept no fasts;
he was like a heathen and he was a tyrant.</p>

<p>‘Alī-dost T̤aghāī<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a> was another, one of the Sāghārīchī <i>tumān</i>-begs
and a relation of my mother’s mother, Aīsān-daulat Begīm.
I favoured him more than he had been favoured in ‘Umar
Shaikh Mīrzā’s time. People said, “Work will come from his
hand.” But in the many years he was in my presence, no
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;15.</span>work to speak of<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a> came to sight. He must have served Sl.
Abū-sa‘īd Mīrzā. He claimed to have power to bring on rain
with the jade-stone. He was the Falconer (<i>qūshchī</i>),worthless
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>by nature and habit, a stingy, severe, strife-stirring person, false,
self-pleasing, rough of tongue and cold-of-face.</p>

<p>Wais <i>Lāgharī</i>,<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a> one of the Samarkand <i>Tūghchī</i> people, was
another. Latterly he was much in ‘Umar Shaikh Mīrzā’s confidence;
in the guerilla times he was with me. Though somewhat
factious, he was a man of good judgment and counsel.</p>

<p>Mīr Ghiyās̤ T̤aghāi was another, a younger brother of ‘Ali-dost
T̤aghāī. No man amongst the leaders in Sl. Abū-sa‘īd Mīrzā’s
Gate was more to the front than he; he had charge of the
Mīrzā’s square seal<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a> and was much in his confidence latterly.
He was a friend of Wais <i>Lāgharī</i>. When Kāsān had been given
to Sl. Maḥmūd Khān (899<span class="smcap lowercase">AH</span>.-1494<span class="smcap lowercase">AD</span>. ), he was continuously in
The Khān’s service and was in high favour. He was a laugher,
a joker and fearless in vice.</p>

<p>‘Ali-darwesh <i>Khurāsānī</i> was another. He had served in the
Khurāsān Cadet Corps, one of two special corps of serviceable
young men formed by Sl. Abū-sa‘īd Mīrzā when he first began
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;15b.</span>to arrange the government of Khurāsān and Samarkand, and,
presumably, called by him the Khurāsān Corps and the Samarkand
Corps. ‘Alī-darwesh was a brave man; he did well in my
presence at the Gate of Bīshkārān.<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a> He wrote the <i>naskh ta‘līq</i>
hand clearly.<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a> His was the flatterer’s tongue and in his
character avarice was supreme.</p>

<p>Qaṃbar-‘alī <i>Mughūl</i> of the Equerries (<i>akhtachī</i>) was another.
People called him The Skinner because his father, on first
coming into the (Farghāna) country, worked as a skinner.
Qaṃbar-‘alī had been Yūnas Khān’s water-bottle bearer,<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a> later
on he became a beg. Till he was a made man, his conduct
was excellent; once arrived, he was slack. He was full of
talk and of foolish talk,&mdash;a great talker is sure to be a foolish
one,&mdash;his capacity was limited and his brain muddy.</p>

<p>At the time of ‘Umar Shaikh Mīrzā’s accident, I was in the
Four Gardens (<i>Chār-bāgh</i>) of Andijān.<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a> The news reached
Andijān on Tuesday, Ramẓan 5 (June 9th); I mounted at once,
with my followers and retainers, intending to go into the fort

(<i>bāyrī</i>) of my father and the foster-father of one of his daughters.
He dispelled our fears and, turning back from near the Praying

Khwāja Maulānā-i-qāẓī and the begs came to my

the fort.<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a> A few days later, Ḥasan, son of Yaq‘ūb, and Qāsim

country.</p></div>

<p>Meantime Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā took Aūrā-tīpā, Khujand and
Marghīnān, came on to Qabā,<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a> 4 <i>yīghāch</i> from Andijān and
there made halt. At this crisis, Darwesh Gau, one of the
Andijān notables, was put to death on account of his improper
proposals; his punishment crushed the rest.</p>

<p>Khwāja Qāẓī and Aūzūn (Long) Ḥasan,<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a> (brother) of Khwāja
Ḥusain, were then sent to Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā to say in effect
that, as he himself would place one of his servants in the
country and as I was myself both a servant and (as) a son, he
would attain his end most readily and easily if he entrusted the
service to me. He was a mild, weak man, of few words who,
without his begs, decided no opinion or compact (<i>aun</i>), action
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>or move; they paid attention to our proposal, gave it a harsh
answer and moved forward.</p>

<p>But the Almighty God, who, of His perfect power and without
mortal aid, has ever brought my affairs to their right issue,
made such things happen here that they became disgusted at
having advanced (<i>i.e.</i> from Qabā), repented indeed that they
had ever set out on this expedition and turned back with
nothing done.</p>

<p>One of those things was this: Qabā has a stagnant, morass-like
Water,<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a> passable only by the bridge. As they were many,
there was crowding on the bridge and numbers of horses and<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;17.</span>
camels were pushed off to perish in the water. This disaster
recalling the one they had had three or four years earlier when
they were badly beaten at the passage of the Chīr, they gave
way to fear. Another thing was that such a murrain broke
out amongst their horses that, massed together, they began to
die off in bands.<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a> Another was that they found in our soldiers
and peasants a resolution and single-mindedness such as would
not let them flinch from making offering of their lives<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a> so long
as there was breath and power in their bodies. Need being
therefore, when one <i>yīghāch</i> from Andijān, they sent Darwesh
Muḥammad Tarkhān<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a> to us; Ḥasan of Yaq’ūb went out from
those in the fort; the two had an interview near the Praying
Place and a sort of peace was made. This done, Sl. Aḥmad
Mīrzā’s force retired.</p>

<p>Meantime Sl. Maḥmūd Khān had come along the north of
the Khujand Water and laid siege to Akhsī.<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a> In Akhsī was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>Jahāngīr Mīrzā (aet. 9) and of begs, ‘Alī-darwesh Beg, Mīrzā
Qulī <i>Kūkūldāsh</i>, Muḥ. Bāqir Beg and Shaikh ‘Abdu’l-lāh, Lord
of the Gate. Wais <i>Lāgharī</i> and Mīr Ghiyās̤ T̤aghāī had been
there too, but being afraid of the (Akhsī) begs had gone off to
Kāsān, Wais <i>Lāgharī’s</i> district, where, he being Nāṣir Mīrzā’s
guardian, the Mīrzā was.<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a> They went over to Sl. Maḥmūd
Khān when he got near Akhsī; Mīr Ghiyās̤ entered his service;
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;17b.</span>Wais <i>Lāgharī</i> took Nāṣir Mīrzā to Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā, who
entrusted him to Muh. Mazīd Tarkhān’s charge. The Khān,
though he fought several times near Akhsī, could not effect anything
because the Akhsī begs and braves made such splendid
offering of their lives. Falling sick, being tired of fighting too,
he returned to his own country (<i>i.e.</i> Tāshkīnt).</p>

<p>For some years, Ābā-bikr <i>Kāshgharī Dūghlāt</i>,<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a> bowing the
head to none, had been supreme in Kāshgar and Khutan. He
now, moved like the rest by desire for my country, came to the
neighbourhood of Aūzkīnt, built a fort and began to lay the
land waste. Khwāja Qāzī and several begs were appointed to
drive him out. When they came near, he saw himself no match
for such a force, made the Khwāja his mediator and, by a
hundred wiles and tricks, got himself safely free.</p>

<p>Throughout these great events, ‘Umar Shaikh Mīrzā’s former
begs and braves had held resolutely together and made daring
offer of their lives. The Mīrzā’s mother, Shāh Sult̤ān Begīm,<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a>
and Jaḥāngīr Mīrzā and the <i>ḥaram</i> household and the begs came
from Akhsī to Andijān; the customary mourning was fulfilled
and food and victuals spread for the poor and destitute.<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;18.</span>In the leisure from these important matters, attention was
given to the administration of the country and the ordering of
the army. The Andijān Government and control of my Gate
were settled (<i>mukarrar</i>) for Ḥasan (son) of Yaq’ūb; Aūsh was
decided on (<i>qarār</i>) for Qāsim <i>Qūchīn</i>; Akhsī and Marghīnān
assigned (<i>ta’īn</i>) to Aūzun Ḥasan and ‘Alī-dost T̤aghāī. For the
rest of ‘Umar Shaikh Mīrzā’s begs and braves, to each according
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
to his circumstances, were settled and assigned district
(<i>wilāyat</i>) or land (<i>yīr</i>) or office (<i>mauja</i>) or charge (<i>jīrga</i>) or
stipend (<i>wajh</i>).</p>

<p>When Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā had gone two or three stages on his
return-march, his health changed for the worse and high fever
appeared. On his reaching the Āq Sū near Aūrā-tīpā, he bade
farewell to this transitory world, in the middle of Shawwāl of
the date 899 (mid July 1494 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>) being then 44 (lunar) years old.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>m. Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā’s birth and descent.</i></p>

<p>He was born in 855 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (1451 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>) the year in which his father
took the throne (<i>i.e.</i> Samarkand). He was Sl. Abū-sa‘īd Mīrzā’s
eldest son; his mother was a daughter of Aūrdū-būghā Tarkhān
(<i>Arghūn</i>), the elder sister of Darwesh Muḥammad Tarkhān, and
the most honoured of the Mīrzā’s wives.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>n. His appearance and habits.</i></p>

<p>He was a tall, stout, brown-bearded and red-faced man. He
had beard on his chin but none on his cheeks. He had very<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;18b.</span>
pleasing manners. As was the fashion in those days, he wound
his turban in four folds and brought the end forward over his
brows.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>o. His characteristics and manners.</i></p>

<p>He was a True Believer, pure in the Faith; five times daily,
without fail, he recited the Prayers, not omitting them even on
drinking-days. He was a disciple of his Highness Khwāja
‘Ubaidu’l-lāh (<i>Aḥrārī</i>), his instructor in religion and the
strengthener of his Faith. He was very ceremonious, particularly
when sitting with the Khwāja. People say he never drew
one knee over the other<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a> at any entertainment of the Khwāja.
On one occasion contrary to his custom, he sat with his feet
together. When he had risen, the Khwāja ordered the place
he had sat in to be searched; there they found, it may have been,
a bone.<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">200</a> He had read nothing whatever and was ignorant
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>(<i>‘amī</i>), and though town-bred, unmannered and homely. Of
genius he had no share. He was just and as his Highness the
Khwāja was there, accompanying him step by step,<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a> most of his
affairs found lawful settlement. He was true and faithful to
his vow and word; nothing was ever seen to the contrary. He
had courage, and though he never happened to get in his own
hand to work, gave sign of it, they say, in some of his encounters.
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;19.</span>He drew a good bow, generally hitting the duck<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a>
both with his arrows (<i>aūq</i>) and his forked-arrows (<i>tīr-giz</i>), and,
as a rule, hit the gourd<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a> in riding across the lists (<i>maidān</i>).
Latterly, when he had grown stout, he used to take quail and
pheasant with the goshawks,<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a> rarely failing. A sportsman he
was, hawking mostly and hawking well; since Aūlūgh Beg
Mīrzā, such a sporting <i>pādshāh</i> had not been seen. He was
extremely decorous; people say he used to hide his feet even in
the privacy of his family and amongst his intimates. Once
settled down to drink, he would drink for 20 or 30 days at a
stretch; once risen, would not drink again for another 20 or
30 days. He was a good drinker;<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a> on non-drinking days he ate
without conviviality (<i>basīt̤</i>). Avarice was dominant in his
character. He was kindly, a man of few words whose will was
in the hands of his begs.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>p. His battles.</i></p>

<p>He fought four battles. The first was with Ni’mat <i>Arghūn</i>,
Shaikh Jamāl <i>Arghūn’s</i> younger brother, at Āqār-tūzī, near
Zamīn. This he won. The second was with ‘Umar Shaikh
Mīrzā at Khwaṣ; this also he won. The third affair was when
he encountered Sl. Maḥmūd Khān on the Chīr, near Tāshkīnt
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;19b.</span>(895 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1469 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>). There was no real fighting, but some Mughūl
plunderers coming up, by ones and twos, in his rear and laying
hands on his baggage, his great army, spite of its numbers,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
broke up without a blow struck, without an effort made, without
a coming face to face, and its main body was drowned in the
Chīr.<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">206</a> His fourth affair was with Ḥaidar <i>Kūkūldāsh</i> (<i>Mughūl</i>),
near Yār-yīlāq; here he won.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>q. His country.</i></p>

<p>Samarkand and Bukhārā his father gave him; Tāshkīnt and
Sairām he took and held for a time but gave them to his
younger brother, ‘Umar Shaikh Mīrzā, after ‘Abdu’l-qadūs
(<i>Dūghlāt</i>) slew Shaikh Jamāl (<i>Arghūn</i>); Khujand and Aūrātīpā
were also for a time in his possession.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>r. His children.</i></p>

<p>His two sons did not live beyond infancy. He had five
daughters, four by Qātāq Begīm.<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a></p>

<p>Rābi‘a-sult̤ān Begīm, known as the Dark-eyed Begīm, was
his eldest. The Mīrzā himself made her go forth to Sl. Maḥmūd
Khān;<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a> she had one child, a nice little boy, called Bābā
Khān. The Aūzbegs killed him and several others of age as
unripe as his when they martyred (his father) The Khān, in
Khujand, (914 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1508 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>). At that time she fell to Jānī
Beg Sult̤ān (<i>Aūzbeg</i>).<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;20.</span></p>

<p>Ṣāliḥa-sult̤ān (Ṣalīqa) Begīm was his second daughter;
people called her the Fair Begīm. Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā, after
her father’s death, took her for his eldest son, Sl. Mas‘ūd
Mīrzā and made the wedding feast (900 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>). Later on she
fell to the Kāshgharī with Shāh Begīm and Mihr-nigār Khānim.</p>

<p>‘Āyisha-sult̤ān Begīm was the third. When I was five and
went to Samarkand, they set her aside for me; in the guerilla
times<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a> she came to Khujand and I took her (905 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>); her one
little daughter, born after the second taking of Samarkand,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>went in a few days to God’s mercy and she herself left me at
the instigation of an older sister.</p>

<p>Sult̤ānīm Begīm was the fourth daughter; Sl. ‘Alī Mīrzā
took her; then Tīmūr Sult̤ān (<i>Aūzbeg</i>) took her and after him,
Mahdī Sult̤ān (<i>Aūzbeg</i>).</p>

<p>Ma‘sūma-sult̤ān Begīm was the youngest of Sl. Aḥmad
Mīrzā’s daughters. Her mother, Ḥabība-sult̤ān Begīm, was of
the Arghūns, a daughter of Sl. Ḥusain <i>Arghūn’s</i> brother. I
saw her when I went to Khurāsān (912 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1506 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>), liked her,
asked for her, had her brought to Kābul and took her (913 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1507
<span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>). She had one daughter and there and then, went to
God’s mercy, through the pains of the birth. Her name was at
once given to her child.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>s. His ladies and mistresses.</i></p>

<p>Mihr-nigār Khānīm was his first wife, set aside for him by
his father, Sl. Abū-sa‘īd Mīrzā. She was Yūnas Khān’s eldest
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;20b.</span>daughter and my mother’s full-sister.</p>

<p>Tarkhān Begīm of the Tarkhāns was another of his wives.</p>

<p>Qātāq Begīm was another, the foster-sister of the Tarkhān
Begīm just mentioned. Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā took her <i>par amours</i>
(<i>‘āshiqlār bīlā</i>): she was loved with passion and was very
dominant. She drank wine. During the days of her ascendancy
(<i>tīrīklīk</i>), he went to no other of his <i>ḥaram</i>; at last he took up a
proper position (<i>aūlnūrdī</i>) and freed himself from his reproach.<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">210</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>
<p>Khān-zāda Begīm, of the Tīrmīẕ Khāns, was another. He
had just taken her when I went, at five years old, to Samarkand;
her face was still veiled and, as is the Turkī custom,
they told me to uncover it.<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">211</a></p>

<p>Lat̤īf Begīm was another, a daughter’s child of Aḥmad Ḥājī
Beg <i>Dūldāī</i> (<i>Barlās</i>). After the Mīrzā’s death, Ḥamza Sl. took
her and she had three sons by him. They with other sult̤āns’
children, fell into my hands when I took Ḥiṣār (916 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1510 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>)
after defeating Ḥamza Sult̤ān and Tīmūr Sult̤ān. I set all free.</p>

<p>Ḥabība-sult̤ān Begīm was another, a daughter of the brother
of Sl. Ḥusain <i>Arghūn</i>.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>t. His amīrs.</i></p>

<p>Jānī Beg <i>Dūldāī</i> (<i>Barlās</i>) was a younger brother of Sl. Malik
<i>Kāshgharī</i>. Sl. Abū-sa‘īd Mīrzā gave him the Government of
Samarkand and Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā gave him the control of
his own Gate.<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">212</a> He must have had singular habits and<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;21.</span>
manners;<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a> many strange stories are told about him. One is
this:&mdash;While he was Governor in Samarkand, an envoy came
to him from the Aūzbegs renowned, as it would seem, for his
strength. An Aūzbeg, is said to call a strong man a bull (<i>būkuh</i>).
“Are you a <i>būkuh</i>?” said Jānī Beg to the envoy, “If you are,
come, let’s have a friendly wrestle together (<i>kūrāshālīng</i>).”
Whatever objections the envoy raised, he refused to accept.
They wrestled and Jānī Beg gave the fall. He was a brave
man.</p>

<p>Aḥmad Ḥājī (<i>Dūldāī Barlās</i>) was another, a son of Sl. Malik
<i>Kāshgharī</i>. Sl. Abū-sa‘īd Mīrzā gave him the Government of
Hīrī (Harāt) for a time but sent him when his uncle, Jānī Beg
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>died, to Samarkand with his uncle’s appointments. He was
pleasant-natured and brave. Wafā’ī was his pen-name and he
put together a dīwān in verse not bad. This couplet is his:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">“I am drunk, Inspector, to-day keep your hand off me,</div>
<div class="line">“Inspect me on the day you catch me sober.”</div>

<p>Mīr ‘Alī-sher Nāwā’ī when he went from Hīrī to Samarkand,
was with Aḥmad Ḥājī Beg but he went back to Hīrī when
Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā (Bāī-qarā) became supreme (873 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1460 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>)
and he there received exceeding favour.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;21b.</span>Aḥmad Ḥājī Beg kept and rode excellent <i>tīpūchāqs</i>,<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">214</a> mostly
of his own breeding. Brave he was but his power to command
did not match his courage; he was careless and what
was necessary in his affairs, his retainers and followers put
through. He fell into Sl. ‘Alī Mīrzā’s hands when the Mīrzā
defeated Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā in Bukhārā (901 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>), and was then
put to a dishonourable death on the charge of the blood of
Darwesh Muḥammad Tarkhān.<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a></p>

<p>Darwesh Muḥammad Tarkhān (<i>Arghūn</i>) was another, the
son of Aūrdū-būghā Tarkhān and full-brother of the mother of
Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā and Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā.<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">216</a> Of all begs in

chess often and well, thoroughly understood the science of

<p>‘Abdu’l-‘alī Tarkhān was another, a near relation of Darwesh
Muḥammad Tarkhān, possessor also of his younger sister,<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">219</a>
that is to say, Bāqī Tarkhān’s mother. Though both by the
Mughūl rule (<i>tūrā</i>) and by his rank, Darwesh Muḥammad

regarded him not at all. For some years he had the
Government of Bukhārā. His retainers were reckoned at<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;22.</span>
3,000 and he kept them well and handsomely. His gifts
(<i>bakhshīsh</i>), his visits of enquiry (<i>purshīsh</i>), his public audience
(<i>dīwān</i>), his work-shops (<i>dast-gāh</i>), his open-table (<i>shīlān</i>) and
his assemblies (<i>majlis</i>) were all like a king’s. He was a strict
disciplinarian, a tyrannical, vicious, self-infatuated person.
Shaibānī Khān, though not his retainer, was with him for a
time; most of the lesser (Shaibān) sult̤āns did themselves take
service with him. This same ‘Abdu’l-‘alī Tarkhān was the
cause of Shaibānī Khān’s rise to such a height and of the downfall
of such ancient dynasties.<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">220</a></p>

<p>Sayyid Yūsuf, the Grey Wolfer<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">221</a> was another; his grandfather
will have come from the Mughūl horde; his father was favoured
by Aūlūgh Beg Mīrzā (<i>Shāhrukhī</i>). His judgment and counsel
were excellent; he had courage too. He played well on the
guitar (<i>qūbuz</i>). He was with me when I first went to Kābul; I
shewed him great favour and in truth he was worthy of favour.
I left him in Kābul the first year the army rode out for Hindūstān;
at that time he went to God’s mercy.<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">222</a></p>

<p>Darwesh Beg was another; he was of the line of Aīku-tīmūr
Beg,<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">223</a> a favourite of Tīmūr Beg. He was a disciple of his
Highness Khwāja ‘Ubaidu’l-lāh (<i>Aḥrārī</i>), had knowledge of the
science of music, played several instruments and was naturally<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;22b.</span>
disposed to poetry. He was drowned in the Chīr at the time of
Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā’s discomfiture.</p>

<p>Muḥammad Mazīd Tarkhān was another, a younger full-brother
of Darwesh Muḥ. Tarkhān. He was Governor in
Turkistān for some years till Shaibānī Khān took it from him.
His judgment and counsel were excellent; he was an
unscrupulous and vicious person. The second and third times
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>I took Samarkand, he came to my presence and each time I
shewed him very great favour. He died in the fight at Kūl-i-malik
(918 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1512 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>).</p>

<p>Bāqī Tarkhān was another, the son of ‘Abdu’l-‘alī Tarkhān
and Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā’s aunt. When his father died, they gave
him Bukhārā. He grew in greatness under Sl. ‘Alī Mīrzā, his
retainers numbering 5 or 6,000. He was neither obedient nor
very submissive to Sl. ‘Alī Mīrzā. He fought Shaibānī Khān at
Dabūsī (905 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>) and was crushed; by the help of this defeat,
Shaibānī Khān went and took Bukhārā. He was very fond of
hawking; they say he kept 700 birds. His manners and habits
were not such as may be told;<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">224</a> he grew up with a Mīrzā’s
state and splendour. Because his father had shewn favour
to Shaibānī Khān, he went to the Khān’s presence, but that
inhuman ingrate made him no sort of return in favour and kindness.
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;23.</span>He left the world at Akhsī, in misery and wretchedness.</p>

<p>Sl. Ḥusain <i>Arghūn</i> was another. He was known as Qarā-kūlī
because he had held the Qarā-kūl government for a time.
His judgment and counsel were excellent; he was long in my
presence also.</p>

<p>Qulī Muḥammad <i>Būghdā</i><a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">225</a> was another, a <i>qūchīn</i>; he must
have been a brave man.</p>

<p>‘Abdu’l-karīm <i>Ishrit</i><a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">226</a> was another; he was an Aūīghūr, Sl.
Aḥmad Mīrzā’s Lord of the Gate, a brave and generous man.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>u. Historical narrative resumed.</i>)</p>

<p>After Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā’s death, his begs in agreement, sent a
courier by the mountain-road to invite Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā.<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">227</a></p>

<p>Malik-i-Muḥammad Mīrzā, the son of Minūchihr Mīrzā, Sl.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>Abū-sa‘īd Mīrzā’s eldest brother, aspired for his own part to
rule. Having drawn a few adventurers and desperadoes to
himself, they dribbled away<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">228</a> from (Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā’s) camp
and went to Samarkand. He was not able to effect anything,
but he brought about his own death and that of several innocent
persons of the ruling House.</p>

<p>At once on hearing of his brother’s death, Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā
went off to Samarkand and there seated himself on the throne,
without difficulty. Some of his doings soon disgusted and
alienated high and low, soldier and peasant. The first of these
was that he sent the above-named Malik-i-Muḥammad to the<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;23b.</span>
Kūk-sarāī,<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">229</a> although he was his father’s brother’s son and his
own son-in-law.<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">230</a> With him he sent others, four Mīrzās in all.
Two of these he set aside; Malik-i-Muḥammad and one other
he martyred. Some of the four were not even of ruling rank
and had not the smallest aspiration to rule; though Malik-i-Muḥammad
Mīrzā was a little in fault, in the rest there was no
blame whatever. A second thing was that though his methods
and regulations were excellent, and though he was expert in
revenue matters and in the art of administration, his nature
inclined to tyranny and vice. Directly he reached Samarkand,
he began to make new regulations and arrangements and to
rate and tax on a new basis. Moreover the dependants of his
(late) Highness Khwāja ‘Ubaid’l-lāh, under whose protection
formerly many poor and destitute persons had lived free from
the burden of dues and imposts, were now themselves treated
with harshness and oppression. On what ground should hardship
have touched them? Nevertheless oppressive exactions
were made from them, indeed from the Khwāja’s very children.
Yet another thing was that just as he was vicious and tyrannical,
so were his begs, small and great, and his retainers and followers.
The Ḥiṣārīs and in particular the followers of Khusrau Shāh
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>engaged themselves unceasingly with wine and fornication.
Once one of them enticed and took away a certain man’s wife.
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;24.</span>When her husband went to Khusrau Shāh and asked for justice,
he received for answer: “She has been with you for several
years; let her be a few days with him.” Another thing was
that the young sons of the townsmen and shopkeepers, nay!
even of Turks and soldiers could not go out from their houses
from fear of being taken for catamites. The Samarakandīs,
having passed 20 or 25 years under Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā in ease
and tranquillity, most matters carried through lawfully and with
justice by his Highness the Khwāja, were wounded and
troubled in heart and soul, by this oppression and this vice.
Low and high, the poor, the destitute, all opened the mouth to
curse, all lifted the hand for redress.</p>

<p>By reason of his infamous violence and vice Sl. Maḥmud

<p>This year Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā sent an envoy, named ‘Abdu’l-qadūs
Beg,<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">233</a> to bring me a gift from the wedding he had
made with splendid festivity for his eldest son, Mas‘ūd Mīrzā
with (Ṣāliḥa-sult̤ān), the Fair Begīm, the second daughter of
his elder brother, Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā. They had sent gold and
silver almonds and pistachios.</p>

<p>There must have been relationship between this envoy and
Ḥasan-i-yaq‘ūb, and on its account he will have been the man
sent to make Ḥasan-i-yaq‘ūb, by fair promises, look towards
Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā. Ḥasan-i-yaq‘ūb returned him a smooth
answer, made indeed as though won over to his side, and gave
him leave to go. Five or six months later, his manners
changed entirely; he began to behave ill to those about me
and to others, and he carried matters so far that he would
have dismissed me in order to put Jahāngīr Mīrzā in my place.
Moreover his conversation with the whole body of begs and
soldiers was not what should be; every-one came to know what
was in his mind. Khwāja-i-Qāzī and (Sayyid) Qāsim <i>Qūchīn</i>
and ‘Alī-dost T̤aghāī met other well-wishers of mine in the
presence of my grandmother, Āīsān-daulat Begīm and decided
to give quietus to Ḥasan-i-yaq‘ūb’s disloyalty by his deposition.</p>

<p>Few amongst women will have been my grandmother’s
equals for judgment and counsel; she was very wise and far-sighted
and most affairs of mine were carried through under
her advice. She and my mother were (living) in the Gate-house
of the outer fort;<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">234</a> Ḥasan-i-yaq‘ūb was in the citadel.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p><p>When I went to the citadel, in pursuance of our decision, he had
ridden out, presumably for hawking, and as soon as he had
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;25.</span>our news, went off from where he was towards Samarkand.
The begs and others in sympathy with him,<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">235</a> were arrested;
one was Muḥammad Bāqir Beg; Sl. Maḥmud <i>Dūldāī</i>, Sl.
Muḥammad <i>Dūldāī’s</i> father, was another; there were several
more; to some leave was given to go for Samarkand. The
Andijān Government and control of my Gate were settled on
(Sayyid) Qāsim <i>Qūchīn</i>.</p>

<p>A few days after Ḥasan-i-yaq‘ūb reached Kand-i-badām on
the Samarkand road, he went to near the Khūqān sub-division
(<i>aūrchīn</i>) with ill-intent on Akhsī. Hearing of it, we sent
several begs and braves to oppose him; they, as they went,
detached a scouting party ahead; he, hearing this, moved
against the detachment, surrounded it in its night-quarters<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">236</a>
and poured flights of arrows (<i>shība</i>) in on it. In the darkness
of the night an arrow (<i>aūq</i>), shot by one of his own men,
hit him just (<i>aūq</i>) in the vent (<i>qāchār</i>) and before he could take
vent (<i>qāchār</i>),<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">237</a> he became the captive of his own act.</p>

<p>In the month of the latter Rabī‘ (January 1495 AD.), Sl. Maḥmūd
Mīrzā was confronted by violent illness and in six days,
passed from the world. He was 43 (lunar) years old.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>b. His birth and lineage.</i></p>

<p>He was born in 857 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (1453 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>), was Sl. Abū-sa‘īd
Mīrzā’s third son and the full-brother of Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā.<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">240</a></p>

<p class="indent"><i>c. His appearance and characteristics.</i></p>

<p>He was a short, stout, sparse-bearded and somewhat ill-shaped
person. His manners and his qualities were good, his
rules and methods of business excellent; he was well-versed in
accounts, not a <i>dinār</i> or a <i>dirhām</i><a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">241</a> of revenue was spent without
his knowledge. The pay of his servants was never disallowed.
His assemblies, his gifts, his open table, were all good. Everything
of his was orderly and well-arranged;<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">242</a> no soldier or
peasant could deviate in the slightest from any plan of his.
Formerly he must have been hard set (<i>qātīrār</i>) on hawking but
latterly he very frequently hunted driven game.<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">243</a> He carried
violence and vice to frantic excess, was a constant wine-bibber
and kept many catamites. If anywhere in his territory, there
was a handsome boy, he used, by whatever means, to have him
brought for a catamite; of his begs’ sons and of his sons’ begs’
sons he made catamites; and laid command for this service on<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;26.</span>
his very foster brothers and on their own brothers. So
common in his day was that vile practice, that no person was
without his catamite; to keep one was thought a merit, not to
keep one, a defect. Through his infamous violence and vice,
his sons died in the day of their strength (<i>tamām juwān</i>).</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p><p>He had a taste for poetry and put a <i>dīwān</i><a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">244</a> together but his
verse is flat and insipid,&mdash;not to compose is better than to
compose verse such as his. He was not firm in the Faith and
held his Highness Khwāja ‘Ubaidu’l-lāh (<i>Aḥrārī</i>) in slight
esteem. He had no heart (<i>yūruk</i>) and was somewhat scant in
modesty,&mdash;several of his impudent buffoons used to do their
filthy and abominable acts in his full Court, in all men’s sight.
He spoke badly, there was no understanding him at first.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>d. His battles.</i></p>

<p>He fought two battles, both with Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā (<i>Bāīqarā</i>).
The first was in Astarābād; here he was defeated.
The second was at Chīkman (Sarāī),<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">245</a> near Andikhūd; here
also he was defeated. He went twice to Kāfiristān, on the
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;26b.</span>south of Badakhshān, and made Holy War; for this reason
they wrote him Sl. Maḥmūd <i>Ghāzī</i> in the headings of his
public papers.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>e. His countries.</i></p>

<p>Sl. Abū-sa‘īd Mīrzā gave him Astarābād.<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">246</a> After the ‘Irāq
disaster (<i>i.e.</i>, his father’s death,) he went into Khurāsān. At
that time, Qaṃbar-‘alī Beg, the governor of Ḥiṣār, by Sl. Abū-sa‘īd
Mīrzā’s orders, had mobilized the Hindūstān<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">247</a> army and
was following him into ‘Irāq; he joined Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā in
Khurāsān but the Khurāsānīs, hearing of Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā’s
approach, rose suddenly and drove them out of the country.
On this Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā went to his elder brother, Sl.
Aḥmad Mīrzā in Samarkand. A few months later Sayyid
Badr and Khusrau Shāh and some braves under Aḥmad</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mushtāq</i><a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">248</a> took him and fled to Qaṃbar-‘alī in Ḥiṣār. From
that time forth, Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā possessed the countries
lying south of Quhqa (Quhlugha) and the Kohtin Range as far
as the Hindū-kush Mountains, such as Tīrmīẕ, Chaghānīān,
Ḥiṣār, Khutlān, Qūndūz and Badakhshān. He also held
Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā’s lands, after his brother’s death.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>f. His children.</i></p>

<p>He had five sons and eleven daughters.</p>

<p>Sl. Mas‘ūd Mīrzā was his eldest son; his mother was Khān-zāda<span class="sidenote">Fol 27.</span>
Begīm, a daughter of the Great Mīr of Tīrmīẕ. Bāī-sunghar
Mīrzā was another; his mother was Pasha (or Pāshā)
Begīm. Sl. ‘Alī Mīrzā was another; his mother was an
Aūzbeg, a concubine called Zuhra Begī Āghā. Sl. Ḥusain
Mīrzā was another; his mother was Khān-zāda Begīm, a
grand-daughter of the Great Mīr of Tīrmīẕ; he went to God’s
mercy in his father’s life-time, at the age of 13. Sl. Wais
Mīrzā (Mīrzā Khān) was another; his mother, Sult̤ān-nigār
Khānīm was a daughter of Yūnas Khān and was a younger
(half-) sister of my mother. The affairs of these four Mīrzās
will be written of in this history under the years of their
occurrence.</p>

<p>Of Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā’s daughters, three were by the same
mother as Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā. One of these, Bāī-sunghar
Mīrzā’s senior, Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā made to go out to Malik-i-muḥammad
Mīrzā, the son of his paternal uncle, Minūchihr
Mīrzā.<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">249</a></p>

<p>Five other daughters were by Khān-zāda Begīm, the grand-daughter
of the Great Mīr of Tīrmīẕ. The oldest of these,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>(Khān-zāda Begīm)<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">250</a> was given, after her father’s death, to Abā-bikr
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;27b.</span>(<i>Dūghlāt</i>) <i>Kāshgharī</i>. The second was Bega Begīm. When
Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā besieged Ḥiṣār (901 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>), he took her for
Ḥaidar Mīrzā, his son by Pāyanda Begīm, Sl. Abū-sa‘īd Mīrzā’s
daughter, and having done so, rose from before the place.<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">251</a>
The third daughter was Āq (Fair) Begīm; the fourth<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">252</a>&mdash;,was
betrothed to Jahāngīr Mīrzā (<i>aet.</i> 5, <i>circa</i> 895 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>) at the time
his father, ‘Umar Shaikh Mīrzā sent him to help Sl. Maḥmūd
Mīrzā with the Andijān army, against Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā, then
attacking Qūndūz.<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">253</a> In 910 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (1504 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>) when Bāqī <i>Chaghānīānī</i><a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">254</a>
waited on me on the bank of the Amū (Oxus), these
(last-named two) Begīms were with their mothers in Tīrmīẕ
and joined me then with Bāqī’s family. When we reached
Kahmard, Jahāngīr Mīrzā took &mdash;&mdash; Begīm; one little
daughter was born; she now<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">255</a> is in the Badakhshān country
with her grandmother. The fifth daughter was Zainab-sult̤ān
Begīm; under my mother’s insistence, I took her at the time
of the capture of Kābul (910 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-Oct. 1504 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>). She did not
become very congenial; two or three years later, she left the
world, through small-pox. Another daughter was Makhdūm-sult̤ān
Begīm, Sl. ‘Alī Mīrzā’s full-sister; she is now in the
Badakhshān country. Two others of his daughters, Rajab-sult̤ān
and Muḥibb-sult̤ān, were by mistresses (<i>ghūnchachī</i>).</p>

<p class="indent"><i>g. His ladies</i> (<i>khwātīnlār</i>) <i>and concubines</i> (<i>sarārī</i>).</p>

<p>His chief wife, Khān-zāda Begīm, was a daughter of the
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;28.</span>Great Mīr of Tirmīẕ; he had great affection for her and must
have mourned her bitterly; she was the mother of Sl. Mas‘ūd
Mīrzā. Later on, he took her brother’s daughter, also called
Khān-zāda Begīm, a grand-daughter of the Great Mīr of Tīrmīẕ.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>She became the mother of five of his daughters and one of his
sons. Pasha (or Pāshā) Begīm was another wife, a daughter of
‘Alī-shukr Beg, a Turkmān Beg of the Black Sheep Bahārlū
Aīmāq.<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">256</a> She had been the wife of Jahān-shāh (<i>Barānī</i>) of the
Black Sheep Turkmāns. After Aūzūn (Long) Ḥasan Beg of
the White Sheep had taken Āẕar-bāījān and ‘Irāq from the
sons of this Jahān-shāh Mīrzā (872 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1467 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>), ‘Alī-shukr
Beg’s sons went with four or five thousand heads-of-houses
of the Black Sheep Turkmāns to serve Sl. Abū-sa‘īd Mīrzā and
after the Mīrzā’s defeat (873 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> by Aūzūn Ḥasan), came down
to these countries and took service with Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā.
This happened after Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā came to Ḥiṣār from
Samarkand, and then it was he took Pasha Begīm. She
became the mother of one of his sons and three of his daughters.
Sult̤ān-nigār Khānīm was another of his ladies; her descent
has been mentioned already in the account of the (Chaghatāī)
Khāns.<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;28b.</span></p>

<p>He had many concubines and mistresses. His most honoured
concubine (<i>mu‘atabar ghūma</i>) was Zuhra Begī Āghā; she was
taken in his father’s life-time and became the mother of one son
and one daughter. He had many mistresses and, as has been
said, two of his daughters were by two of them.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>h. His amirs.</i></p>

<p>Khusrau Shāh was of the Turkistānī Qīpchāqs. He had
been in the intimate service of the Tarkhān begs, indeed had
been a catamite. Later on he became a retainer of Mazīd Beg
(Tarkhān) <i>Arghūn</i> who favoured him in all things. He was
favoured by Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā on account of services done by
him when, after the ‘Irāq disaster, he joined the Mīrzā on his
way to Khurāsān. He waxed very great in his latter days;
his retainers, under Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā, were a clear five or six
thousand. Not only Badakhshān but the whole country from
the Amū to the Hindū-kush Mountains depended on him and
he devoured its whole revenue (<i>darobast yīr īdī</i>). His open table
was good, so too his open hand; though he was a rough getter,<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">257</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>what he got, he spent liberally. He waxed exceeding great
after Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā’s death, in whose sons’ time his retainers
approached 20,000. Although he prayed and abstained
from forbidden aliments, yet was he black-souled and vicious,
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;29.</span>dunder-headed and senseless, disloyal and a traitor to his salt.
For the sake of this fleeting, five-days world,<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">258</a> he blinded one of
his benefactor’s sons and murdered another. A sinner before
God, reprobate to His creatures, he has earned curse and
execration till the very verge of Resurrection. For this world’s
sake he did his evil deeds and yet, with lands so broad and
with such hosts of armed retainers, he had not pluck to
stand up to a hen. An account of him will come into this
history.</p>

Hazārāspī’s fight<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">260</a> he got in one challenge with his fists in Sl.
Abū-sa‘īd Mīrzā’s presence at the Gate of Balkh. He was a
brave man, continuously serving the Mīrzā (Maḥmūd) and
guiding him by his counsel. Out of rivalry to Khusrau Shāh,
he made a night-attack when the Mīrzā was besieging Qūndūz,
on Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā, with few men, without arming<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">261</a> and
without plan; he could do nothing; what was there he could
do against such and so large a force? He was pursued, threw
himself into the river and was drowned.</p>

<p>Ayūb (<i>Begchīk Mughūl</i>)<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">262</a> was another. He had served in Sl.
Abū-sa‘īd Mīrzā’s Khurāsān Cadet Corps, a brave man, Bāīsunghar
Mīrzā’s guardian. He was choice in dress and food;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>a jester and talkative, nicknamed Impudence, perhaps because
the Mīrzā called him so.<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;29b.</span></p>

<p>Walī was another, the younger, full-brother of Khusrau Shāh.
He kept his retainers well. He it was brought about the
blinding of Sl. Mas‘ūd Mīrzā and the murder of Bāī-sunghar
Mīrzā. He had an ill-word for every-one and was an evil-tongued,
foul-mouthed, self-pleasing and dull-witted mannikin.
He approved of no-one but himself. When I went from the
Qūndūz country to near Dūshī (910 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1503 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>), separated
Khusrau Shāh from his following and dismissed him, this
person (<i>i.e.</i>, Walī) had come to Andar-āb and Sīr-āb, also in
fear of the Aūzbegs. The Aīmāqs of those parts beat and
robbed him<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">263</a> then, having let me know, came on to Kābul.
Walī went to Shaibānī Khān who had his head struck off in
the town of Samarkand.</p>

<p>Shaikh ‘Abdu’l-lāh <i>Barlās</i><a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">264</a> was another; he had to wife one
of the daughters of Shāh Sult̤ān Muḥammad (<i>Badakhshī</i>) <i>i.e.</i>,
the maternal aunt of Abā-bikr Mīrzā (<i>Mīrān-shāhī</i>) and of Sl.
Maḥmūd Khān. He wore his tunic narrow and <i>pur shaqq</i><a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">265</a>; he
was a kindly well-bred man.</p>

<p>Maḥmūd <i>Barlās</i> of the Barlāses of Nūndāk (Badakhshān)
was another. He had been a beg also of Sl. Abū-sa‘īd Mīrzā
and had surrendered Karmān to him when the Mīrzā took the
‘Irāq countries. When Abā-bikr Mīrzā (<i>Mīrān-shāhī</i>) came<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;30.</span>
against Ḥiṣār with Mazīd Beg Tarkhān and the Black Sheep
Turkmāns, and Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā went off to his elder brother,
Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā in Samarkand, Maḥmūd <i>Barlās</i> did not
surrender Ḥiṣār but held out manfully.<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">266</a> He was a poet and
put a <i>dīwān</i> together.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>i. Historical narrative resumed</i>).</p>

<p>When Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā died, Khusrau Shāh kept the
event concealed and laid a long hand on the treasure. But
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>how could such news be hidden? It spread through the town
at once. That was a festive day for the Samarkand families;
soldier and peasant, they uprose in tumult against Khusrau
Shāh. Aḥmad Ḥājī Beg and the Tarkhānī begs put the rising
down and turned Khusrau Shāh out of the town with an escort
for Ḥiṣār.</p>

<p>As Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā himself after giving Ḥiṣār to Sl.
Mas‘ūd Mīrzā and Bukhārā to Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā, had dismissed
both to their governments, neither was present when he
died. The Ḥiṣār and Samarkand begs, after turning Khusrau
Shāh out, agreed to send for Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā from Bukhārā,
brought him to Samarkand and seated him on the throne.
When he thus became supreme (<i>pādshāh</i>), he was 18 (lunar)
years old.</p>

<p>At this crisis, Sl. Maḥmūd Khān (<i>Chaghatāī</i>), acting on the
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;30b.</span>word of Junaid <i>Barlās</i> and of some of the notables of
Samarkand, led his army out to near Kān-bāī with desire to
take that town. Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā, on his side, marched out
in force. They fought near Kān-bāī. Ḥaidar <i>Kūkūldāsh</i>, the
main pillar of the Mughūl army, led the Mughūl van. He and
all his men dismounted and were pouring in flights of arrows
(<i>shība</i>) when a large body of the mailed braves of Ḥiṣār and
Samarkand made an impetuous charge and straightway laid
them under their horses’ feet. Their leader taken, the Mughūl
army was put to rout without more fighting. Masses (<i>qālīn</i>) of
Mughūls were wiped out; so many were beheaded in Bāī-sunghar
Mīrzā’s presence that his tent was three times shifted
because of the number of the dead.</p>

<p>At this same crisis, Ibrāhīm <i>Sārū</i> entered the fort of Asfara,
there read Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā’s name in the <i>Khut̤ba</i> and took
up a position of hostility to me.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(<i>Author’s note.</i>) Ibrāhīm <i>Sārū</i> is of the Mīnglīgh people;<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">267</a> he had
served my father in various ways from his childhood but later on had
been dismissed for some fault.</p></div>

<p><span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;31.</span>The army rode out to crush this rebellion in the month of
Sha’bān (May) and by the end of it, had dismounted round
Asfara. Our braves in the wantonness of enterprise, on the very
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>day of arrival, took the new wall<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">268</a> that was in building outside
the fort. That day Sayyid Qāsim, Lord of my Gate, out-stripped
the rest and got in with his sword; Sl. Aḥmad <i>Taṃbal</i>
and Muḥammad-dost T̤aghāī got theirs in also but Sayyid
Qāsim won the Champion’s Portion. He took it in Shāhrukhiya
when I went to see my mother’s brother, Sl. Maḥmūd
Khān.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(<i>Author’s note.</i>) The Championship Portion<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">269</a> is an ancient usage of
the Mughūl horde. Whoever outdistanced his tribe and got in with
his own sword, took the portion at every feast and entertainment.</p></div>

<p>My guardian, Khudāī-bīrdī Beg died in that first day’s fighting,
struck by a cross-bow arrow. As the assault was made
without armour, several bare braves (<i>yīkīt yīlāng</i>)<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">270</a> perished and
many were wounded. One of Ibrāhīm <i>Sārū’s</i> cross-bowmen
was an excellent shot; his equal had never been seen; he it
was hit most of those wounded. When Asfara had been
taken, he entered my service.</p>

<p>As the siege drew on, orders were given to construct head-strikes<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">271</a>
in two or three places, to run mines and to make every<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;31b.</span>
effort to prepare appliances for taking the fort. The siege
lasted 40 days; at last Ibrāhīm <i>Sārū</i> had no resource but,
through the mediation of Khwāja Moulānā-i-qāẓī, to elect to
serve me. In the month of Shawwāl (June 1495 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>) he came
out, with his sword and quiver hanging from his neck, waited
on me and surrendered the fort.</p>

<p>Khujand for a considerable time had been dependent on
‘Umar Shaikh Mīrzā’s Court (<i>dīwān</i>) but of late had looked
towards Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā on account of the disturbance in
the Farghāna government during the interregnum.<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">272</a> As the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>opportunity offered, a move against it also was now made.
Mīr Mughūl’s father, ‘Abdu’l-wahhāb <i>Shaghāwal</i><a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">273</a> was in it; he
surrendered without making any difficulty at once on our
arrival.</p>

<p>Just then Sl. Maḥmūd Khān was in Shāhrukhiya. It has
been said already that when Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā came into
Andijān (899 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>), he also came and that he laid siege to Akhsī.
It occurred to me that if since I was so close, I went and
waited on him, he being, as it were, my father and my elder
brother, and if bye-gone resentments were laid aside, it would
be good hearing and seeing for far and near. So said, I
went.</p>

<p>I waited on The Khān in the garden Ḥaidar <i>Kūkūldāsh</i> had
made outside Shāhrukhiya. He was seated in a large four-doored
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;32.</span>tent set up in the middle of it. Having entered the
tent, I knelt three times,<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">274</a> he for his part, rising to do me
honour. We looked one another in the eyes;<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">275</a> and he returned
to his seat. After I had kneeled, he called me to his
side and shewed me much affection and friendliness. Two
or three days later, I set off for Akhsī and Andijān by the
Kīndīrlīk Pass.<a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">276</a> At Akhsī I made the circuit of my Father’s
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>tomb. I left at the hour of the Friday Prayer (<i>i.e.</i>, about midday)
and reached Andijān, by the Band-i-sālār Road between
the Evening and Bedtime Prayers. This road <i>i.e.</i> the Band-i-sālār,
people call a nine <i>yīghāch</i> road.<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">277</a></p>

<p>One of the tribes of the wilds of Andijān is the Jīgrāk<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">278</a> a
numerous people of five or six thousand households, dwelling
in the mountains between Kāshghar and Farghāna. They have
many horses and sheep and also numbers of yāks (<i>qūtās</i>), these
hill-people keeping yāks instead of common cattle. As their
mountains are border-fastnesses, they have a fashion of not
paying tribute. An army was now sent against them under
(Sayyid) Qāsim Beg in order that out of the tribute taken from
them something might reach the soldiers. He took about
20,000 of their sheep and between 1000 and 1500 of their
horses and shared all out to the men.</p>

<p>After its return from the Jīgrāk, the army set out for Aūrā-tīpā.<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;34.</span>
Formerly this was held by ‘Umar Shaikh Mīrzā but it
had gone out of hand in the year of his death and Sl. ‘Alī
Mīrzā was now in it on behalf of his elder brother, Bāīsunghar
Mīrzā. When Sl. ‘Alī Mīrzā heard of our coming, he
went off himself to the Macha hill-country, leaving his guardian,
Shaikh Ẕū’n-nūn <i>Arghūn</i> behind. From half-way between
Khujand and Aūrā-tīpā, Khalīfa<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">279</a> was sent as envoy to Shaikh
Ẕū’n-nūn but that senseless mannikin, instead of giving him a
plain answer, laid hands on him and ordered him to death.
For Khalīfa to die cannot have been the Divine will; he
escaped and came to me two or three days later, stripped bare
and having suffered a hundred <i>tūmāns</i> (1,000,000) of hardships
and fatigues. We went almost to Aūrā-tīpā but as, winter
being near, people had carried away their corn and forage, after
a few days we turned back for Andijān. After our retirement,
The Khān’s men moved on the place when the Aūrā-tīpā

The Khān then gave it to Muḥammad Ḥusain <i>Kūrkān Dūghlāt</i>
and in his hands it remained till 908 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (1503).<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">281</a></p>

<p>In the winter of this year, Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā led his army out
of Khurāsān against Ḥiṣār and went to opposite Tīrmīẕ. Sl.
Mas‘ūd Mīrzā, for his part, brought an army (from Ḥiṣār) and
sat down over against him in Tīrmīẕ. Khusrau Shāh
strengthened himself in Qūndūz and to help Sl. Mas‘ūd Mīrzā
sent his younger brother, Walī. They (<i>i.e.</i>, the opposed forces)
spent most of that winter on the river’s banks, no crossing
being effected. Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā was a shrewd and experienced
commander; he marched up the river,<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">283</a> his face set for Qūndūz
and by this having put Sl. Mas‘ūd Mīrzā off his guard, sent
‘Abdu’l-lat̤īf <i>Bakhshī</i> (pay-master) with 5 or 600 serviceable
men, down the river to the Kilīf ferry. These crossed and had
entrenched themselves on the other bank before Sl. Mas‘ūd
Mīrzā had heard of their movement. When he did hear of it,
whether because of pressure put upon him by Bāqī <i>Chaghānīānī</i>
to spite (his half-brother) Walī, or whether from his own want
of heart, he did not march against those who had crossed but
disregarding Walī’s urgency, at once broke up his camp and
turned for Ḥiṣār.<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">284</a></p>

<p>Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā crossed the river and then sent, (1) against
Khusrau Shāh, Badī‘u’z-zamān Mīrzā and Ibrāhīm Ḥusain
Mīrzā with Muḥammad Walī Beg and Ẕū’n-nūn <i>Arghūn</i>, and<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;33b.</span>

<i>Barandūq Barlās</i>. He himself moved for Ḥiṣār.</p>

<p>When those in Ḥiṣār heard of his approach, they took their
precautions; Sl. Mas‘ūd Mīrzā did not judge it well to stay in
the fort but went off up the Kām Rūd valley<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">285</a> and by way of
Sara-tāq to his younger brother, Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā in Samarkand.
Walī, for his part drew off to (his own district) Khutlān.
Bāqī <i>Chaghānīānī</i>, Maḥmūd <i>Barlās</i> and Qūch Beg’s father, Sl.
Aḥmad strengthened the fort of Ḥiṣār. Ḥamza Sl. and Mahdī
Sl. (<i>Aūzbeg</i>) who some years earlier had left Shaibānī Khān for
(the late) Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā’s service, now, in this dispersion,
drew off with all their Aūzbegs, for Qarā-tīgīn. With them
went Muḥammad <i>Dūghlāt</i><a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">286</a> and Sl. Ḥusain <i>Dūghlāt</i> and all the
Mughūls located in the Ḥiṣār country.</p>

<p>Upon this Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā sent Abū’l-muḥsin Mīrzā after
Sl. Mas‘ūd Mīrzā up the Kām Rūd valley. They were not
strong enough for such work when they reached the defile.<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">287</a>
There Mīrzā Beg <i>Fīringī-bāz</i><a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">288</a> got in his sword. In pursuit of
Ḥamza Sl. into Qarā-tīgīn, Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā sent Ibrāhīm
Tarkhān and Yaq‘ūb-i-ayūb. They overtook the sult̤āns and
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;33.</span>fought. The Mīrzā’s detachment was defeated; most of his
begs were unhorsed but all were allowed to go free.</p>

<p>As a result of this exodus, Ḥamza Sl. with his son, Mamāq

located in Ḥiṣār as (the late) Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā’s retainers,
came, after letting me know (their intention), and waited upon
me in Ramẓān (May-June) at Andijān. According to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>custom of Tīmūriya sult̤āns on such occasions, I had seated
myself on a raised seat (<i>tūshāk</i>); when Ḥamza Sl. and Mamāq
Sl. and Mahdī Sl. entered, I rose and went down to do them
honour; we looked one another in the eyes and I placed them

<p class="indent">(<i>c. Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā’s affairs resumed</i>).</p>

<p>Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā, on reaching Ḥiṣār, settled down at once to
besiege it. There was no rest, day nor night, from the labours
of mining and attack, of working catapults and mortars. Mines
were run in four or five places. When one had gone well
forward towards the Gate, the townsmen, countermining, struck
it and forced smoke down on the Mīrzā’s men; they, in turn,<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;34b.</span>
closed the hole, thus sent the smoke straight back and made the
townsmen flee as from the very maw of death. In the end, the
townsmen drove the besiegers out by pouring jar after jar of
water in on them. Another day, a party dashed out from the
town and drove off the Mīrzā’s men from their own mine’s
mouth. Once the discharges from catapults and mortars in the
Mīrzā’s quarters on the north cracked a tower of the fort; it
fell at the Bed-time Prayer; some of the Mīrzā’s braves begged
to assault at once but he refused, saying, “It is night.” Before
the shoot of the next day’s dawn, the besieged had rebuilt the
whole tower. That day too there was no assault; in fact, for
the two to two and a half months of the siege, no attack was
made except by keeping up the blockade,<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">290</a> by mining, rearing

<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;35.</span>as many more? None the less did such Mīrzās and such
Commander-begs elect for prudence and remain in their entrenchments!
Good and bad, small and great, Khusrau Shāh’s
force may have been of 4 or 5,000 men!</p>

<p>This was the one exploit of his life,&mdash;of this man who for the
sake of this fleeting and unstable world and for the sake of
shifting and faithless followers, chose such evil and such ill-repute,
practised such tyranny and injustice, seized such wide
lands, kept such hosts of retainers and followers,&mdash;latterly he led
out between 20 and 30,000 and his countries and his districts
(<i>parganāt</i>) exceeded those of his own ruler and that ruler’s sons,<a name="FNanchor_293" id="FNanchor_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">293</a>&mdash;for
an exploit such as this his name and the names of his
adherents were noised abroad for generalship and for this they
were counted brave, while those timorous laggards, in the
trenches, won the resounding fame of cowards.</p>

<p>Badī‘u’z-zamān Mīrzā marched out from that camp and after
a few stages reached the Alghū Mountain of Tāliqān<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">294</a> and there
made halt. Khusrau Shāh, in Qūndūz, sent his brother, Walī,
with serviceable men, to Ishkīmīsh, Fulūl and the hill-skirts
thereabouts to annoy and harass the Mīrzā from outside also.
Muḥibb-‘alī, the armourer, (<i>qūrchī</i>) for his part, came down
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;35b.</span>(from Walī’s Khutlān) to the bank of the Khutlān Water, met
in with some of the Mīrzā’s men there, unhorsed some, cut off
a few heads and got away. In emulation of this, Sayyidīm
‘Alī<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">295</a> the door-keeper, and his younger brother, Qulī Beg and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>Bihlūl-i-ayūb and a body of their men got to grips with the
Khurāsānīs on the skirt of ‘Aṃbar Koh, near Khwāja Changāl
but, many Khurāsānīs coming up, Sayyidīm ‘Alī and Bābā
Beg’s (son) Qulī Beg and others were unhorsed.</p>

<p>At the time these various news reached Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā,
his army was not without distress through the spring rains of
Ḥiṣār; he therefore brought about a peace; Maḥmūd <i>Barlās</i>
came out from those in the fort; Ḥājī Pīr the Taster went from
those outside; the great commanders and what there was (<i>nī
kīm</i>) of musicians and singers assembled and the Mīrzā took
(Bega Begīm), the eldest<a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">296</a> daughter of Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā by
Khān-zāda Begīm, for Ḥaidar Mīrzā, his son by Pāyanda Begīm
and through her the grandson of Sl. Abū-sa‘īd Mīrzā. This
done, he rose from before Ḥiṣār and set his face for Qūndūz.</p>

<p>At Qūndūz also Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā made a few trenches and
took up the besieger’s position but by Badī‘u’z-zamān Mīrzā’s
intervention peace at length was made, prisoners were exchanged
and the Khurāsānīs retired. The twice-repeated<a name="FNanchor_297" id="FNanchor_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">297</a>
attacks made by Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā on Khusrau Shāh and his
unsuccessful retirements were the cause of Khusrau Shāh’s<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;36.</span>
great rise and of action of his so much beyond his province.</p>

<p>When the Mīrzā reached Balkh, he, in the interests of Ṃāwarā’u’n-nahr
gave it to Badī‘u’z-zamān Mīrzā, gave Badī‘u’z-zamān
Mīrzā’s district of Astarābād to (a younger son), Muz̤affar
Ḥusain Mīrzā and made both kneel at the same assembly, one
for Balkh, the other for Astarābād. This offended Badī‘u’z-zamān
Mīrzā and led to years of rebellion and disturbance.<a name="FNanchor_298" id="FNanchor_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">298</a></p>

<p class="indent">(<i>d. Revolt of the Tarkhānīs in Samarkand</i>).</p>

<p>In Ramẓān of this same year, the Tarkhānīs revolted in
Samarkand. Here is the story:&mdash;Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā was not so
friendly and familiar with the begs and soldiers of Samarkand
as he was with those of Ḥiṣār.<a name="FNanchor_299" id="FNanchor_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">299</a> His favourite beg was Shaikh

Mīrzā that it made a relation as of Lover and Beloved. These
things displeased the Tarkhāns and the Samarkandī begs;
Darwesh Muḥammad Tarkhān went from Bukhārā to Qarshī,
brought Sl. ‘Alī Mīrzā to Samarkand and raised him to be
supreme. People then went to the New Garden where Bāī-sunghar
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;36b.</span>Mīrzā was, treated him like a prisoner, parted him
from his following and took him to the citadel. There they
seated both mīrzās in one place, thinking to send Bāī-sunghar
Mīrzā to the Gūk Sarāī close to the Other Prayer. The Mīrzā,
however, on plea of necessity, went into one of the palace-buildings
on the east side of the Bū-stān Sarāī. Tarkhānīs
stood outside the door and with him went in Muḥammad Qulī
<i>Qūchīn</i> and Ḥasan, the sherbet-server. To be brief:&mdash;A gateway,
leading out to the back, must have been bricked up for they
broke down the obstacle at once. The Mīrzā got out of the
citadel on the Kafshīr side, through the water-conduit (<i>āb-mūrī</i>),
dropped himself from the rampart of the water-way (<i>dū-tahī</i>),
and went to Khwājakī Khwāja’s<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">301</a> house in Khwāja Kafshīr.
When the Tarkhānīs, in waiting at the door, took the precaution
of looking in, they found him gone. Next day the Tarkhānīs
went in a large body to Khwājakī Khwāja’s gate but the
Khwāja said, “No!”<a name="FNanchor_302" id="FNanchor_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">302</a> and did not give him up. Even they could
not take him by force, the Khwāja’s dignity was too great for
them to be able to use force. A few days later, Khwāja Abu’l-makāram<a name="FNanchor_303" id="FNanchor_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">303</a>
and Aḥmad Ḥājī Beg and other begs, great and
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;37.</span>small, and soldiers and townsmen rose in a mass, fetched
the Mīrzā away from the Khwāja’s house and besieged
Sl. ‘Ali Mīrzā and the Tarkhāns in the citadel. They
could not hold out for even a day; Muḥ. Mazīd Tarkhān
went off through the Gate of the Four Roads for Bukhārā;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>Sl. ‘Alī Mīrzā and Darwesh Muḥ. Tarkhān were made
prisoner.</p>

<p>Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā was in Aḥmad Ḥājī Beg’s house when
people brought Darwesh Muḥammad Tarkhān in. He put him
a few questions but got no good answer. In truth Darwesh
Muḥammad’s was a deed for which good answer could not be
made. He was ordered to death. In his helplessness he clung
to a pillar<a name="FNanchor_304" id="FNanchor_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">304</a> of the house; would they let him go because he
clung to a pillar? They made him reach his doom (<i>siyāsat</i>)
and ordered Sl. ‘Alī Mīrzā to the Gūk Sarāī there to have the
fire-pencil drawn across his eyes.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(<i>Author’s note.</i>) The Gūk Sarāī is one of Tīmūr Beg’s great buildings
in the citadel of Samarkand. It has this singular and special characteristic,
if a Tīmūrid is to be seated on the throne, here he takes his
seat; if one lose his head, coveting the throne, here he loses it; therefore
the name Gūk Sarāī has a metaphorical sense (<i>kināyat</i>) and to say of
any ruler’s son, “They have taken him to the Gūk Sarāī,” means, to
death.<a name="FNanchor_305" id="FNanchor_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">305</a></p></div>

<p>To the Gūk Sarāī accordingly Sl. ‘Alī Mīrzā was taken but
when the fire-pencil was drawn across his eyes, whether by the
surgeon’s choice or by his inadvertence, no harm was done.<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;37b.</span>
This the Mīrzā did not reveal at once but went to Khwāja
Yahya’s house and a few days later, to the Tarkhāns in
Bukhārā.</p>

<p>Through these occurrences, the sons of his Highness Khwāja
‘Ubaidu’l-lāh became settled partisans, the elder (Muḥammad
‘Ubaidu’l-lāh, Khwājakī Khwāja) becoming the spiritual guide
of the elder prince, the younger (Yahya) of the younger. In a
few days, Khwāja Yahya followed Sl. ‘Alī Mīrzā to Bukhārā.</p>

<p>Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā led out his army against Bukhārā. On
his approach, Sl. ‘Alī Mīrzā came out of the town, arrayed for
battle. There was little fighting; Victory being on the side of
Sl. ‘Alī Mīrzā, Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā sustained defeat. Aḥmad
Ḥājī Beg and a number of good soldiers were taken; most of
the men were put to death. Aḥmad Ḥājī Beg himself the slaves
and slave-women of Darwesh Muḥammad Tarkhān, issuing out
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>of Bukhārā, put to a dishonourable death on the charge of their
master’s blood.</p>

<p>These news reached us in Andijān in the month of Shawwāl

we got our men to horse. Moved by a like desire, Sl. Mas’ūd

To reinforce him, Khusrau Shāh laid hands (<i>qāptī</i>) on his

town from three sides during three or four months; then
Khwāja Yahya came to me from Sl. ‘Alī Mīrzā to mediate an
agreement with a common aim. The matter was left at an
interview arranged (<i>kūrūshmak</i>); I moved my force from Soghd
to some 8m. below the town; Sl. ‘Alī Mīrzā from his side,
brought his own; from one bank, he, from the other, I crossed
to the middle of<a name="FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">307</a> the Kohik water, each with four or five men;

Bukhārā, I to Andijān.</p>

<p>Sl. Mas‘ūd Mīrzā had a penchant for a daughter of Shaikh

<p class="indent">(<i>a. Bābur’s second attempt on Samarkand.</i>)</p>

<p>This winter, Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā’s affairs were altogether in a
good way. When ‘Abdu’l-karīm <i>Ushrit</i> came on Sl. ‘Alī Mīrzā’s
part to near Kūfīn, Mahdī Sl. led out a body of Bāī-sunghar
Mīrzā’s troops against him. The two commanders meeting
exactly face to face, Mahdī Sl. pricked ‘Abdu’l-karīm’s horse
with his Chirkas<a name="FNanchor_310" id="FNanchor_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">310</a> sword so that it fell, and as ‘Abdu’l-karīm
was getting to his feet, struck off his hand at the wrist. Having
taken him, they gave his men a good beating.</p>

<p>These (Aūzbeg) sult̤āns, seeing the affairs of Samarkand and
the Gates of the (Tīmūrid) Mīrzās tottering to their fall, went off
in good time (<i>āīrtā</i>) into the open country (?)<a name="FNanchor_311" id="FNanchor_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">311</a> for Shaibānī.</p>

Mīrzā went to Sar-i-pul (Bridge-head), Sl. ‘Alī Mīrzā
to Khwāja Kārzūn. Meantime, Khwāja Abū’l-makāram, at
the instigation of Khwāja Munīr of Aūsh, rode light against<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;39.</span>
Bukhārā with Wais <i>Lāgharī</i> and Muḥammad Bāqir of the
Andijān begs, and Qāsim <i>Dūldāī</i> and some of the Mīrzā’s
household. As the Bukhāriots took precautions when the
invaders got near the town, they could make no progress.
They therefore retired.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>
<p>At the time when (last year) Sl. ‘Alī Mīrzā and I had our
interview, it had been settled<a name="FNanchor_313" id="FNanchor_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">313</a> that this summer he should
come from Bukhārā and I from Andijān to beleaguer Samarkand.
To keep this tryst, I rode out in Ramẓān (May) from
Andijān. Hearing when close to Yār Yīlāq, that the (two)
Mīrzās were lying front to front, we sent Tūlūn Khwāja
<i>Mūghūl</i><a name="FNanchor_314" id="FNanchor_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">314</a> ahead, with 2 or 300 scouting braves (<i>qāzāq yīkītlār</i>).
Their approach giving Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā news of our advance,
he at once broke up and retired in confusion. That same
night our detachment overtook his rear, shot a mass (<i>qālīn</i>) of
his men and brought in masses of spoil.</p>

<p>Two days later we reached Shīrāz. It belonged to Qāsim
Beg <i>Dūldāī</i>; his <i>dārogha</i> (Sub-governor) could not hold it and
surrendered.<a name="FNanchor_315" id="FNanchor_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">315</a> It was given into Ibrāhīm <i>Sārū’s</i> charge. After
making there, next day, the Prayer of the Breaking of the
Fast (<i>‘Īdu’l-fit̤r</i>), we moved for Samarkand and dismounted
in the reserve (<i>qūrūgh</i>) of Āb-i-yār (Water of Might). That
day waited on me with 3 or 400 men, Qāsim <i>Dūldāī</i>,
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;39b.</span>Wais <i>Lāgharī</i>, Muḥammad Sīghal’s grandson, Ḥasan,<a name="FNanchor_316" id="FNanchor_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">316</a> and Sl.
Muḥammad Wais. What they said was this: ‘Bāī-sunghar
Mīrzā came out and has gone back; we have left him therefore
and are here for the <i>pādshāh’s</i> service,’ but it was known
later that they must have left the Mīrzā at his request to
defend Shīrāz, and that the Shīrāz affair having become what
it was, they had nothing for it but to come to us.</p>

<p>When we dismounted at Qarā-būlāq, they brought in several
Mughūls arrested because of senseless conduct to humble
village elders coming in to us.<a name="FNanchor_317" id="FNanchor_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">317</a> Qāsim Beg <i>Qūchīn</i> for discipline’s

<p>Marching from Qarā-būlāq, we crossed the river (<i>i.e.</i> the
Zar-afshān) and dismounted near Yām.<a name="FNanchor_319" id="FNanchor_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">319</a> On that same day,
our men got to grips with Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā’s at the head of
the Avenue. Sl. Aḥmad <i>Taṃbal</i> was struck in the neck by
a spear but not unhorsed. Khwājakī Mullā-i-ṣadr, Khwāja-i-kalān’s
eldest brother, was pierced in the nape of the neck<a name="FNanchor_320" id="FNanchor_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">320</a> by
an arrow and went straightway to God’s mercy. An excellent
soldier, my father before me had favoured him, making him
Keeper of the Seal; he was a student of theology, had great<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;40.</span>
acquaintance with words and a good style; moreover he undertook
hawking and rain-making with the jade-stone.</p>

<p>While we were at Yām, people, dealers and other, came out
in crowds so that the camp became a bazar for buying and
selling. One day, at the Other Prayer, suddenly, a general
hubbub arose and all those Musalmān (traders) were plundered.
Such however was the discipline of our army that an order to
restore everything having been given, the first watch (<i>pahār</i>) of
the next day had not passed before nothing, not a tag of
cotton, not a broken needle’s point, remained in the possession
of any man of the force, all was back with its owners.</p>

<p>Marching from Yām, it was dismounted in Khān Yūrtī (The
Khān’s Camping Ground),<a name="FNanchor_321" id="FNanchor_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">321</a> some 6 m. (3 <i>kuroh</i>) east of Samarkand.
We lay there for 40 or 50 days. During the time, men
from their side and from ours chopped at one another (<i>chāpqū-lāshtīlār</i>)
several times in the Avenue. One day when Ibrāhīm
<i>Begchīk</i> was chopping away there, he was cut on the face;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>thereafter people called him <i>Chāpūk</i> (<i>Balafré</i>). Another time,
this also in the Avenue, at the Maghāk (Fosse) Bridge<a name="FNanchor_322" id="FNanchor_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">322</a> Abū’l-qāsim
(<i>Kohbur Chaghatāī</i>) got in with his mace. Once, again
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;40b.</span>in the Avenue, near the Mill-sluice, when Mīr Shāh <i>Qūchīn</i> also
got in with his mace, they cut his neck almost half-through;
most fortunately the great artery was not severed.</p>

<p>While we were in Khān Yūrtī, some in the fort sent the
deceiving message,<a name="FNanchor_323" id="FNanchor_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">323</a> ‘Come you to-night to the Lovers’ Cave
side and we will give you the fort.’ Under this idea, we went
that night to the Maghāk Bridge and from there sent a party
of good horse and foot to the rendezvous. Four or five of the
household foot-soldiers had gone forward when the matter got
wind. They were very active men; one, known as Ḥājī, had
served me from my childhood; another people called Maḥmūd
<i>Kūndūr-sangak</i>.<a name="FNanchor_324" id="FNanchor_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">324</a> They were all killed.</p>

<p>While we lay in Khān Yūrtī, so many Samarkandīs came
out that the camp became a town where everything looked for
in a town was to be had. Meantime all the forts, Samarkand
excepted, and the Highlands and the Lowlands were coming in
to us. As in Aūrgūt, however, a fort on the skirt of the
Shavdār (var. Shādwār) range, a party of men held fast<a name="FNanchor_325" id="FNanchor_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">325</a>, of
necessity we moved out from Khān Yūrtī against them. They
could not maintain themselves, and surrendered, making
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;41.</span>Khwāja-i-qāẓī their mediator. Having pardoned their offences
against ourselves, we went back to beleaguer Samarkand.</p>

Mīrzā and Muz̤affar Ḥusain Mīrzā had been made to kneel for
Balkh and Astarābād. From that time till this, many envoys
had come and gone, at last even ‘Alī-sher Beg had gone but
urge it as all did, Badī‘u’z-zamān Mīrzā would not consent to
give up Astarābād. ‘The Mīrzā,’ he said, ‘assigned<a name="FNanchor_327" id="FNanchor_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">327</a> it to my
son, Muḥammad Mū‘min Mīrzā at the time of his circumcision.’
A conversation had one day between him and ‘Alī-sher Beg
testifies to his acuteness and to the sensibility of ‘Alī-sher Beg’s
feelings. After saying many things of a private nature in the

‘What matters?’ rejoined the Mīrzā instantly. ‘Alī-sher Beg

Garzawān,<a name="FNanchor_330" id="FNanchor_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">330</a> went Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā; down (from Balkh) came<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;41b.</span>
Badī‘u’z-zamān Mīrzā. On the first day of Ramẓān (May 2nd.)
Abū’l-muḥsin Mīrzā advanced, leading some of his father’s
light troops. There was nothing to call a battle; Badī‘u’z-zamān
Mīrzā was routed and of his braves masses were made
prisoner. Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā ordered that all prisoners should
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>be beheaded; this not here only but wherever he defeated a
rebel son, he ordered the heads of all prisoners to be struck off.
And why not? Right was with him. The (rebel) Mīrzās
were so given over to vice and social pleasure that even when a
general so skilful and experienced as their father was within
half-a-day’s journey of them, and when before the blessed
month of Ramẓān, one night only remained, they busied themselves
with wine and pleasure, without fear of their father,
without dread of God. Certain it is that those so lost (<i>yūtkān</i>)
will perish and that any hand can deal a blow at those thus
going to perdition (<i>aūtkān</i>). During the several years of
Badī‘u’z-zamān Mīrzā’s rule in Astarābād, his coterie and his
following, his bare (<i>yālāng</i>) braves even, were in full splendour<a href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">331</a>
and adornment. He had many gold and silver drinking cups
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;42.</span>and utensils, much silken plenishing and countless tīpūchāq
horses. He now lost everything. He hurled himself in his
flight down a mountain track, leading to a precipitous fall.
He himself got down the fall, with great difficulty, but many
of his men perished there.<a name="FNanchor_331" id="FNanchor_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">331</a></p>

<p>After defeating Badī‘u’z-zamān Mīrzā, Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā
moved on to Balkh. It was in charge of Shaikh ‘Alī T̤aghāī;
he, not able to defend it, surrendered and made his submission.
The Mīrzā gave Balkh to Ibrāhīm Ḥusain Mīrzā, left
Muḥammad Walī Beg and Shāh Ḥusain, the page, with him
and went back to Khurāsān.</p>

<p>Defeated and destitute, with his braves bare and his bare
foot-soldiers<a name="FNanchor_332" id="FNanchor_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">332</a>, Badī‘u’z-zamān Mīrzā drew off to Khusrau Shāh
in Qūndūz. Khusrau Shāh, for his part, did him good service,
such service indeed, such kindness with horses and camels,
tents and pavilions and warlike equipment of all sorts, both for
himself and those with him, that eye-witnesses said between
this and his former equipment the only difference might be in
the gold and silver vessels.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">(<i>c. Dissension between Sl. Mas‘ūd Mīrzā and Khusrau Shāh.</i>)</p>

<p>Ill-feeling and squabbles had arisen between Sl. Mas‘ūd
Mīrzā and Khusrau Shāh because of the injustices of the one
and the self-magnifyings of the other. Now therefore Khusrau
Shāh joined his brothers, Walī and Bāqī to Badī‘u’z-zamān
Mīrzā and sent the three against Ḥiṣār. They could not even<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;42b.</span>
get near the fort, in the outskirts swords were crossed once or
twice; one day at the Bird-house<a name="FNanchor_333" id="FNanchor_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">333</a> on the north of Ḥiṣār,
Muḥibb-‘alī, the armourer (<i>qūrchī</i>), outstripped his people and
struck in well; he fell from his horse but at the moment of his
capture, his men attacked and freed him. A few days later a
somewhat compulsory peace was made and Khusrau Shāh’s
army retired.</p>

<p>Shortly after this, Badī‘u’z-zamān Mīrzā drew off by the
mountain-road to Ẕū’n-nūn <i>Arghūn</i> and his son, Shujā‘ <i>Arghūn</i>
in Qandahār and Zamīn-dāwar. Stingy and miserly as Ẕū’n-nūn
was, he served the Mīrzā well, in one single present
offering 40,000 sheep.</p>

<p>Amongst curious happenings of the time one was this:
Wednesday was the day Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā beat Badī‘u’z-zamān
Mīrzā; Wednesday was the day Muz̤affar Ḥusain Mīrzā beat
Muḥammad Mū‘min Mīrzā; Wednesday, more curious still,
was the name of the man who unhorsed and took prisoner,
Muḥammad Mū‘min Mīrzā.<a name="FNanchor_334" id="FNanchor_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">334</a></p>

<p class="indent">(<i>a. Resumed account of Bābur’s second attempt on Samarkand.</i>)</p>

<p>When we had dismounted in the Qulba (Plough) meadow,<a name="FNanchor_336" id="FNanchor_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">336</a>
behind the Bāgh-i-maidān (Garden of the plain), the Samarkandīs
came out in great numbers to near Muḥammad Chap’s
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;43.</span>Bridge. Our men were unprepared; and before they were ready,
Bābā ‘Alī’s (son) Bābā Qulī had been unhorsed and taken into
the fort. A few days later we moved to the top of Qulba, at
the back of Kohik.<a name="FNanchor_337" id="FNanchor_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">337</a> That day Sayyid Yūsuf,<a name="FNanchor_338" id="FNanchor_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">338</a> having been
sent out of the town, came to our camp and did me obeisance.</p>

<p>The Samarkandīs, fancying that our move from the one
ground to the other meant, ‘He has given it up,’ came out,
soldiers and townsmen in alliance (through the Turquoise
Gate), as far as the Mīrzā’s Bridge and, through the Shaikh-zāda’s
Gate, as far as Muḥammad Chap’s. We ordered our
braves to arm and ride out; they were strongly attacked from
both sides, from Muḥammad Chap’s Bridge and from the
Mīrzā’s, but God brought it right! our foes were beaten.
Begs of the best and the boldest of braves our men unhorsed
and brought in. Amongst them Ḥāfiẓ <i>Dūldāī’s</i> (son) Muḥammad
<i>Mīskin</i><a name="FNanchor_339" id="FNanchor_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">339</a> was taken, after his index-finger had been
struck off; Muḥammad Qāsim <i>Nabīra</i> also was unhorsed and
brought in by his own younger brother, Ḥasan <i>Nabīra</i>.<a name="FNanchor_340" id="FNanchor_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">340</a> There
were many other such soldiers and known men. Of the town-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>rabble, were brought in Diwāna, the tunic-weaver and <i>Kālqāshūq</i>,<a name="FNanchor_341" id="FNanchor_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">341</a>
headlong leaders both, in brawl and tumult; they<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;43b.</span>
were ordered to death with torture in blood-retaliation for our
foot-soldiers, killed at the Lovers’ Cave.<a name="FNanchor_342" id="FNanchor_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">342</a> This was a complete
reverse for the Samarkandīs; they came out no more
even when our men used to go to the very edge of the ditch
and bring back their slaves and slave-women.</p>

<p>The Sun entered the Balance and cold descended on us.<a name="FNanchor_343" id="FNanchor_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">343</a> I
therefore summoned the begs admitted to counsel and it was
decided, after discussion, that although the towns-people were
so enfeebled that, by God’s grace, we should take Samarkand,
it might be to-day, it might be to-morrow, still, rather than
suffer from cold in the open, we ought to rise from near it and
go for winter-quarters into some fort, and that, even if we had
to leave those quarters later on, this would be done without
further trouble. As Khwāja Dīdār seemed a suitable fort, we
marched there and having dismounted in the meadow lying
before it, went in, fixed on sites for the winter-houses and
covered shelters,<a name="FNanchor_344" id="FNanchor_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">344</a> left overseers and inspectors of the work and
returned to our camp in the meadow. There we lay during
the few days before the winter-houses were finished.</p>

<p>Meantime Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā had sent again and again to
ask help from Shaibānī Khān. On the morning of the very
day on which, our quarters being ready, we had moved into
Khwāja Dīdār, the Khān, having ridden light from Turkistān,<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;44.</span>
stood over against our camping-ground. Our men were not
all at hand; some, for winter-quarters, had gone to Khwāja
Rabāt̤ī, some to Kabud, some to Shīrāz. None-the-less, we
formed up those there were and rode out. Shaibānī Khān
made no stand but drew off towards Samarkand. He
went right up to the fort but because the affair had not gone as</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p><p>Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā wished, did not get a good reception. He
therefore turned back for Turkistān a few days later, in disappointment,
with nothing done.</p>

<p>Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā had sustained a seven months’ siege; his
one hope had been in Shaibānī Khān; this he had lost and he
now with 2 or 300 of his hungry suite, drew off from Samarkand,
for Khusrau Shāh in Qūndūz.</p>

<p>When he was near Tīrmīẕ, at the Amū ferry, the Governor
of Tīrmīẕ, Sayyid Ḥusain Akbar, kinsman and confidant both
of Sl. Mas‘ūd Mīrzā, heard of him and went out against him.
The Mīrzā himself got across the river but Mīrīm Tarkhān was
drowned and all the rest of his people were captured, together
with his baggage and the camels loaded with his personal
effects; even his page, Muḥammad T̤āhir, falling into Sayyid
Ḥusain Akbar’s hands. Khusrau Shāh, for his part, looked
kindly on the Mīrzā.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;44b.</span>When the news of his departure reached us, we got to horse
and started from Khwāja Dīdār for Samarkand. To give us
honourable meeting on the road, were nobles and braves, one
after another. It was on one of the last ten days of the first
Rabī‘ (end of November 1497 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>), that we entered the citadel
and dismounted at the Bū-stān Sarāī. Thus, by God’s favour,
were the town and the country of Samarkand taken and
occupied.</p>

Shāhrukhiya,&mdash;in books written Shāsh and Banākat; and on
the south, Balkh and Tīrmīẕ.</p>

<p>The Kohik Water flows along the north of Samarkand, at
the distance of some 4 miles (2 <i>kuroh</i>); it is so-called because
it comes out from under the upland of the Little Hill (<i>Kohik</i>)<a name="FNanchor_357" id="FNanchor_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">357</a>
lying between it and the town. The Dar-i-gham Water (canal)
flows along the south, at the distance of some two miles
(1 <i>sharī‘</i>). This is a large and swift torrent,<a name="FNanchor_358" id="FNanchor_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">358</a> indeed it is like a
large river, cut off from the Kohik Water. All the gardens and
suburbs and some of the <i>tūmāns</i> of Samarkand are cultivated
by it. By the Kohik Water a stretch of from 30 to 40 <i>yīghāch</i>,<a name="FNanchor_359" id="FNanchor_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">359</a>
by road, is made habitable and cultivated, as far as Bukhārā
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>and Qarā-kūl. Large as the river is, it is not too large for its
dwellings and its culture; during three or four months of the<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;45b.</span>
year, indeed, its waters do not reach Bukhārā.<a name="FNanchor_360" id="FNanchor_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">360</a> Grapes,

Its winter is mightily cold; snow falls but not so much as in
Kābul; in the heats its climate is good but not so good as

<p>In the town and suburbs of Samarkand are many fine buildings
and gardens of Tīmur Beg and Aūlūgh Beg Mīrzā.<a name="FNanchor_362" id="FNanchor_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">362</a></p>

<p>In the citadel,<a name="FNanchor_363" id="FNanchor_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">363</a> Tīmūr Beg erected a very fine building, the
great four-storeyed kiosque, known as the Gūk Sarāī.<a name="FNanchor_364" id="FNanchor_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">364</a> In the
walled-town, again, near the Iron Gate, he built a Friday
Mosque<a name="FNanchor_365" id="FNanchor_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">365</a> of stone (<i>sangīn</i>); on this worked many stone-cutters,
brought from Hindūstān. Round its frontal arch is inscribed
in letters large enough to be read two miles away, the Qu’rān
verse, <i>Wa az yerfa‘ Ibrāhīm al Qawā‘id alī akhara</i>.<a name="FNanchor_366" id="FNanchor_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">366</a> This also
is a very fine building. Again, he laid out two gardens, on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>east of the town, one, the more distant, the Bāgh-i-bulandī,<a name="FNanchor_367" id="FNanchor_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">367</a>
the other and nearer, the Bāgh-i-dilkushā.<a name="FNanchor_368" id="FNanchor_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">368</a> From Dilkushā to
the Turquoise Gate, he planted an Avenue of White Poplar,<a name="FNanchor_369" id="FNanchor_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">369</a>
and in the garden itself erected a great kiosque, painted inside
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;46.</span>with pictures of his battles in Hindūstān. He made another
garden, known as the Naqsh-i-jahān (World’s Picture), on the
skirt of Kohik, above the Qarā-sū or, as people also call it, the
Āb-i-raḥmat (Water-of-mercy) of Kān-i-gil.<a name="FNanchor_370" id="FNanchor_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">370</a> It had gone to
ruin when I saw it, nothing remaining of it except its name.
His also are the Bāgh-i-chanār,<a name="FNanchor_371" id="FNanchor_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">371</a> near the walls and below the
town on the south,<a name="FNanchor_372" id="FNanchor_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">372</a> also the Bāgh-i-shamāl (North Garden)
and the Bāgh-i-bihisht (Garden of Paradise). His own tomb
and those of his descendants who have ruled in Samarkand,
are in a College, built at the exit (<i>chāqār</i>) of the walled-town, by
Muḥammad Sult̤ān Mīrzā, the son of Tīmūr Beg’s son,
Jahāngīr Mīrzā.<a name="FNanchor_373" id="FNanchor_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">373</a></p>

<p>Amongst Aūlūgh Beg Mīrzā’s buildings inside the town are
a College and a monastery (<i>Khānqāh</i>). The dome of the
monastery is very large, few so large are shown in the world.
Near these two buildings, he constructed an excellent Hot
Bath (<i>ḥammām</i>) known as the Mīrzā’s Bath; he had the pavements
in this made of all sorts of stone (? mosaic); such
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>another bath is not known in Khurāsān or in Samarkand.<a name="FNanchor_374" id="FNanchor_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">374</a>
Again;&mdash;to the south of the College is his mosque, known as the
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;46b.</span>Masjid-i-maqat̤a‘ (Carved Mosque) because its ceiling and its
walls are all covered with <i>islīmī</i><a name="FNanchor_375" id="FNanchor_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">375</a> and Chinese pictures formed
of segments of wood.<a name="FNanchor_376" id="FNanchor_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">376</a> There is great discrepancy between the
<i>qibla</i> of this mosque and that of the College; that of the
mosque seems to have been fixed by astronomical observation.</p>

<p>Another of Aūlūgh Beg Mīrzā’s fine buildings is an observatory,
that is, an instrument for writing Astronomical Tables.<a name="FNanchor_377" id="FNanchor_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">377</a>
This stands three storeys high, on the skirt of the Kohik
upland. By its means the Mīrzā worked out the Kūrkānī
Tables, now used all over the world. Less work is done with
any others. Before these were made, people used the Aīl-khānī
Tables, put together at Marāgha, by Khwāja Naṣīr <i>Tūsī</i>,<a name="FNanchor_378" id="FNanchor_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">378</a>
in the time of Hulākū Khān. Hulākū Khān it is, people call
<i>Aīl-khānī</i>.<a name="FNanchor_379" id="FNanchor_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">379</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(<i>Author’s note.</i>) Not more than seven or eight observatories seem to
have been constructed in the world. Māmūm Khalīfa<a name="FNanchor_380" id="FNanchor_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">380</a> (Caliph) made
one with which the <i>Mamūmī</i> Tables were written. Batalmūs (Ptolemy)
constructed another. Another was made, in Hindūstān, in the time of
Rājā Vikramāditya <i>Hīndū</i>, in Ujjain and Dhar, that is, the Mālwa
country, now known as Māndū. The Hindūs of Hindūstān use the
Tables of this Observatory. They were put together 1,584 years ago.<a name="FNanchor_381" id="FNanchor_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">381</a><span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;47.</span>
Compared with others, they are somewhat defective.</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>Aūlūgh Beg Mīrzā again, made the garden known as the
Bāgh-i-maidān (Garden of the Plain), on the skirt of the
Kohik upland. In the middle of it he erected a fine building
they call Chihil Sitūn (Forty Pillars). On both storeys are
pillars, all of stone (<i>tāshdīn</i>).<a name="FNanchor_382" id="FNanchor_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">382</a> Four turrets, like minarets,
stand on its four corner-towers, the way up into them being
through the towers. Everywhere there are stone pillars, some
fluted, some twisted, some many-sided. On the four sides of
the upper storey are open galleries enclosing a four-doored
hall (<i>chār-dara</i>); their pillars also are all of stone. The raised
floor of the building is all paved with stone.</p>

<p>He made a smaller garden, out beyond Chihil Sitūn and
towards Kohik, also having a building in it. In the open
gallery of this building he placed a great stone throne, some
14 or 15 yards (<i>qārī</i>) long, some 8 yards wide and perhaps
1 yard high. They brought a stone so large by a very long
road.<a name="FNanchor_383" id="FNanchor_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">383</a> There is a crack in the middle of it which people say
must have come after it was brought here. In the same
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;47b.</span>garden he also built a four-doored hall, know as the Chīnī-khāna
(Porcelain House) because its <i>īzāra</i><a name="FNanchor_384" id="FNanchor_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">384</a> are all of porcelain;
he sent to China for the porcelain used in it. Inside the walls
again, is an old building of his, known as the Masjid-i-laqlaqa
(Mosque of the Echo). If anyone stamps on the ground under
the middle of the dome of this mosque, the sound echoes back
from the whole dome; it is a curious matter of which none
know the secret.</p>

<p>In the time also of Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā the great and lesser
begs laid out many gardens, large and small.<a name="FNanchor_385" id="FNanchor_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">385</a> For beauty, and
air, and view, few will have equalled Darwesh Muḥammad
Tarkhān’s Chār-bāgh (Four Gardens).<a name="FNanchor_386" id="FNanchor_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">386</a> It lies overlooking
the whole of Qulba Meadow, on the slope below the Bāgh-i-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>maidān. Moreover it is arranged symmetrically, terrace above
terrace, and is planted with beautiful <i>nārwān</i><a name="FNanchor_387" id="FNanchor_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">387</a> and cypresses
and white poplar. A most agreeable sojourning place, its one
defect is the want of a large stream.</p>

<p>Samarkand is a wonderfully beautified town. One of its
specialities, perhaps found in few other places,<a name="FNanchor_388" id="FNanchor_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">388</a> is that the
different trades are not mixed up together in it but each has its
own <i>bāzār</i>, a good sort of plan. Its bakers and its cooks are
good. The best paper in the world is made there; the water
for the paper-mortars<a name="FNanchor_389" id="FNanchor_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">389</a> all comes from Kān-i-gil,<a name="FNanchor_390" id="FNanchor_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">390</a> a meadow on
the banks of the Qarā-sū (Blackwater) or Āb-i-raḥmat (Water<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;48.</span>
of Mercy). Another article of Samarkand trade, carried to all
sides and quarters, is cramoisy velvet.</p>

<p>Excellent meadows lie round Samarkand. One is the
famous Kān-i-gil, some 2 miles east and a little north of the
town. The Qarā-sū or Āb-i-raḥmat flows through it, a stream
(with driving power) for perhaps seven or eight mills. Some
say the original name of the meadow must have been
Kān-i-ābgīr (Mine of Quagmire) because the river is bordered
by quagmire, but the histories all write Kān-i-gil (Mine of clay).
It is an excellent meadow. The Samarkand sult̤ans always
made it their reserve,<a name="FNanchor_391" id="FNanchor_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">391</a> going out to camp in it each year for a
month or two.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p><p>Higher up (on the river) than Kān-i-gil and to the s.e.
of it is a meadow some 4 miles east of the town, known as
Khān Yūrtī (Khān’s Camping-ground). The Qarā-sū flows
through this meadow before entering Kān-i-gil. When it
comes to Khān Yūrtī it curves back so far that it encloses,
with a very narrow outlet, enough ground for a camp. Having
noticed these advantages, we camped there for a time during
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;48b.</span>the siege of Samarkand.<a name="FNanchor_392" id="FNanchor_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">392</a></p>

<p>Another meadow is the Būdana Qūrūgh (Quail Reserve),
lying between Dil-kushā and the town. Another is the Kūl-i-maghāk
(Meadow of the deep pool) at some 4 miles from the
town. This also is a round<a name="FNanchor_393" id="FNanchor_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">393</a> meadow. People call it Kul-i-maghāk
meadow because there is a large pool on one side of it.
Sl. ‘Alī Mīrzā lay here during the siege, when I was in Khān
Yūrtī. Another and smaller meadow is Qulba (Plough); it
has Qulba Village and the Kohik Water on the north, the
Bāgh-i-maidān and Darwesh Muḥammad Tarkhān’s Chār-bāgh
on the south, and the Kohik upland on the west.</p>

<p>Samarkand has good districts and <i>tūmāns</i>. Its largest
district, and one that is its equal, is Bukhārā, 25 <i>yīghāch</i><a name="FNanchor_394" id="FNanchor_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">394</a> to
the west. Bukhārā in its turn, has several <i>tūmāns</i>; it is a fine
town; its fruits are many and good, its melons excellent;
none in Mā warā’u’n-nahr matching them for quality and
quantity. Although the Mīr Tīmūrī melon of Akhsī<a name="FNanchor_395" id="FNanchor_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">395</a> is sweeter
and more delicate than any Bukhārā melon, still in Bukhārā
many kinds of melon are good and plentiful. The Bukhārā
plum is famous; no other equals it. They skin it,<a name="FNanchor_396" id="FNanchor_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">396</a> dry it and
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;49.</span>carry it from land to land with rarities (<i>tabarrūklār bīla</i>); it is
an excellent laxative medicine. Fowls and geese are much
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>looked after (<i>parwārī</i>) in Bukhārā. Bukhārā wine is the strongest
made in Mā warā’u’n-nahr; it was what I drank when drinking
in those countries at Samarkand.<a name="FNanchor_397" id="FNanchor_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">397</a></p>

<p>Kesh is another district of Samarkand, 9 <i>yīghāch</i><a name="FNanchor_398" id="FNanchor_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">398</a> by road
to the south of the town. A range called the Aītmāk Pass
(<i>Dābān</i>)<a name="FNanchor_399" id="FNanchor_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">399</a> lies between Samarkand and Kesh; from this are
taken all the stones for building. Kesh is called also Shahr-i-sabz
(Green-town) because its barren waste (<i>ṣahr</i>) and roofs
and walls become beautifully green in spring. As it was Tīmūr
Beg’s birth-place, he tried hard to make it his capital. He
erected noble buildings in it. To seat his own Court, he built
a great arched hall and in this seated his Commander-begs and
his Dīwān-begs, on his right and on his left. For those
attending the Court, he built two smaller halls, and to seat
petitioners to his Court, built quite small recesses on the four
sides of the Court-house.<a name="FNanchor_400" id="FNanchor_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">400</a> Few arches so fine can be shown in
the world. It is said to be higher than the Kisrī Arch.<a name="FNanchor_401" id="FNanchor_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">401</a>
Tīmūr Beg also built in Kesh a college and a mausoleum,
in which are the tombs of Jahāngīr Mīrzā and others of his
descendants.<a name="FNanchor_402" id="FNanchor_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">402</a> As Kesh did not offer the same facilities as<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;49b.</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>Samarkand for becoming a town and a capital, he at last made
clear choice of Samarkand.</p>

<p>Another district is Qarshī, known also as Nashaf and Nakhshab.<a name="FNanchor_403" id="FNanchor_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">403</a>
Qarshī is a Mughūl name. In the Mughūl tongue they
call a <i>kūr-khāna</i> Qarshī.<a name="FNanchor_404" id="FNanchor_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">404</a> The name must have come in after
the rule of Chīngīz Khān. Qarshī is somewhat scantily supplied
with water; in spring it is very beautiful and its grain
and melons are good. It lies 18 <i>yīghāch</i><a name="FNanchor_405" id="FNanchor_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">405</a> by road south and a
little inclined to west of Samarkand. In the district a small
bird, known as the <i>qīl-qūyīrūgh</i> and resembling the <i>bāghrī qarā</i>,
is found in such countless numbers that it goes by the name of
the Qarshī birdie (<i>murghak</i>).<a name="FNanchor_406" id="FNanchor_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">406</a></p>

<p>Khozār is another district; Karmīna another, lying between
Samarkand and Bukhārā; Qarā-kūl another, 7 <i>yīghāch</i><a name="FNanchor_407" id="FNanchor_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">407</a> n.w.
of Bukhārā and at the furthest limit of the water.</p>

<p>Samarkand has good <i>tūmāns</i>. One is Soghd with its dependencies.
Its head Yār-yīlāq, its foot Bukhārā, there may
be not one single <i>yīghāch</i> of earth without its village and its
cultivated lands. So famous is it that the saying attributed to
Tīmūr Beg, ‘I have a garden 30 <i>yīghāch</i> long,<a name="FNanchor_408" id="FNanchor_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">408</a> must have been
spoken of Soghd. Another <i>tūmān</i> is Shāvdār (var. Shādwār),
an excellent one adjoining the town-suburbs. On one side it
has the range (Aītmāk Dābān), lying between Samarkand and
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;50.</span>Shahr-i-sabz, on the skirts of which are many of its villages.
On the other side is the Kohik Water (<i>i.e.</i> the Dar-i-gham
canal). There it lies! an excellent <i>tūmān</i>, with fine air, full
of beauty, abounding in waters, its good things cheap.
Observers of Egypt and Syria have not pointed out its match.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>
<p>Though Samarkand has other <i>tūmāns</i>, none rank with those
enumerated; with so much, enough has been said.</p>

<p>Tīmūr Beg gave the government of Samarkand to his eldest
son, Jahāngīr Mīrzā (in 776 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1375 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>); when Jahāngīr
Mīrzā died (805 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1403 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>), he gave it to the Mīrzā’s eldest
son, Muḥammad Sult̤ān-i-jahāngīr; when Muḥammad Sult̤ān
Mīrzā died, it went to Shāh-rukh Mīrzā, Tīmūr Beg’s youngest
son. Shāh-rukh Mīrzā gave the whole of Mā warā’u’n-nahr
(in 872 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1467 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>) to his eldest son, Aūlūgh Beg Mīrzā.
From him his own son, ‘Abdu’l-lat̤īf Mīrzā took it, (853 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1449
<span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>), for the sake of this five days’ fleeting world martyring
a father so full of years and knowledge.</p>

<p>After ‘Abdu’l-lat̤īf Mīrzā’s death, (Jumāda I, 22, 855 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-June
22nd. 1450 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>), (his cousin) ‘Abdu’l-lāh Mīrzā, the grandson
of Shāh-rukh Mīrzā through Ibrāhīm Mīrzā, seated himself
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
on the throne and ruled for 18 months to two years.<a name="FNanchor_412" id="FNanchor_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">412</a>
From him Sl. Abū-sa‘īd Mīrzā took it (855 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1451 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>). He
in his life-time gave it to his eldest son, Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā;
Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā continued to rule it after his father’s death
(873 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1469 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>). On his death (899 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1494 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>) Sl. Maḥmūd
Mīrzā was seated on the throne and on his death (900 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1495
<span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>) Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā. Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā was made
prisoner for a few days, during the Tarkhān rebellion (901 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1496
<span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>), and his younger brother, Sl. ‘Alī Mīrzā was seated on
the throne, but Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā, as has been related in this
history, took it again directly. From Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā I
took it (903 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1497 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>). Further details will be learned
from the ensuing history.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>c. Bābur’s rule in Samarkand.</i>)</p>

<p>When I was seated on the throne, I shewed the Samarkand
begs precisely the same favour and kindness they had had
before. I bestowed rank and favour also on the begs with me,
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;51.</span>to each according to his circumstances, the largest share falling
to Sl. Aḥmad <i>Taṃbal</i>; he had been in the household begs’
circle; I now raised him to that of the great begs.</p>

<p>We had taken the town after a seven months’ hard siege.
Things of one sort or other fell to our men when we got in.
The whole country, with exception of Samarkand itself, had
come in earlier either to me or to Sl. ‘Alī Mīrzā and consequently
had not been over-run. In any case however, what
could have been taken from districts so long subjected to raid
and rapine? The booty our men had taken, such as it was,
came to an end. When we entered the town, it was in such
distress that it needed seed-corn and money-advances; what
place was this to take anything from? On these accounts our
men suffered great privation. We ourselves could give them
nothing. Moreover they yearned for their homes and, by ones
and twos, set their faces for flight. The first to go was Bayān
Qulī’s (son) Khān Qulī; Ibrāhīm <i>Begchīk</i> was another; all the
Mughūls went off and, a little later, Sl. Aḥmad <i>Taṃbal</i>.</p>

<p>Aūzūn Ḥasan counted himself a very sincere and faithful
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>friend of Khwāja-i-qāẓī; we therefore, to put a stop to these
desertions, sent the Khwāja to him (in Andijān) so that they,<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;51b.</span>
in agreement, might punish some of the deserters and send
others back to us. But that very Aūzūn Ḥasan, that traitor to
his salt, may have been the stirrer-up of the whole trouble and
the spur-to-evil of the deserters from Samarkand. Directly Sl.
Aḥmad <i>Taṃbal</i> had gone, all the rest took up a wrong position.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>d. Andijān demanded of Bābur by The Khān, and also for Jahāngīr
Mīrzā.</i>)</p>

<p>Although, during the years in which, coveting Samarkand, I
had persistently led my army out, Sl. Maḥmūd Khān<a name="FNanchor_413" id="FNanchor_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">413</a> had
provided me with no help whatever, yet, now it had been taken,
he wanted Andijān. Moreover, Aūzūn Ḥasan and Sl. Aḥmad
<i>Taṃbal</i>, just when soldiers of ours and all the Mughūls had
deserted to Andijān and Akhsī, wanted those two districts for
Jahāngīr Mīrzā. For several reasons, those districts could not
be given to them. One was, that though not promised to The
Khān, yet he had asked for them and, as he persisted in asking,
an agreement with him was necessary, if they were to be given
to Jahāngīr Mīrzā. A further reason was that to ask for them
just when deserters from us had fled to them, was very like a
command. If the matter had been brought forward earlier,
some way of tolerating a command might have been found. At<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;52.</span>
the moment, as the Mughūls and the Andijān army and several
even of my household had gone to Andijān, I had with me in
Samarkand, beg for beg, good and bad, somewhere about 1000
men.</p>

<p>When Aūzūn Ḥasan and Sl. Aḥmad <i>Taṃbal</i> did not get what
they wanted, they invited all those timid fugitives to join them.
Just such a happening, those timid people, for their own sakes,
had been asking of God in their terror. Hereupon, Aūzūn
Ḥasan and Sl. Aḥmad <i>Taṃbal</i>, becoming openly hostile and
rebellious, led their army from Akhsī against Andijān.</p>

<p>Tūlūn Khwāja was a bold, dashing, eager brave of the Bārīn
(Mughūls). My father had favoured him and he was still in
favour, I myself having raised him to the rank of beg. In
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>truth he deserved favour, a wonderfully bold and dashing brave!
He, as being the man I favoured amongst the Mughūls, was
sent (after them) when they began to desert from Samarkand, to
counsel the clans and to chase fear from their hearts so that
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;52b.</span>they might not turn their heads to the wind.<a name="FNanchor_414" id="FNanchor_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">414</a> Those two
traitors however, those false guides, had so wrought on the
clans that nothing availed, promise or entreaty, counsel or
threat. Tūlūn Khwāja’s march lay through Aīkī-sū-ārāsī,<a name="FNanchor_415" id="FNanchor_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">415</a>
known also as Rabāt̤ik-aūrchīnī. Aūzūn Ḥasan sent a
skirmishing party against him; it found him off his guard,
seized and killed him. This done, they took Jahāngīr Mīrzā
and went to besiege Andijān.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>e. Bābur loses Andijān.</i>)</p>

<p>In Andijān when my army rode out for Samarkand, I had
left Aūzūn Ḥasan and ‘Alī-dost T̤aghāī (Ramẓān 902 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-May
1497 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>). Khwāja-i-qāẓī had gone there later on, and there
too were many of my men from Samarkand. During the siege,
the Khwāja, out of good-will to me, apportioned 18,000 of his
own sheep to the garrison and to the families of the men still
with me. While the siege was going on, letters kept coming to
me from my mothers<a name="FNanchor_416" id="FNanchor_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">416</a> and from the Khwāja, saying in effect,
‘They are besieging us in this way; if at our cry of distress you
do not come, things will go all to ruin. Samarkand was taken
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;53.</span>by the strength of Andijān; if Andijān is in your hands, God
willing, Samarkand can be had again.’ One after another
came letters to this purport. Just then I was recovering from
illness but, not having been able to take due care in the days of
convalescence, I went all to pieces again and this time, became
so very ill that for four days my speech was impeded and they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>used to drop water into my mouth with cotton. Those with
me, begs and bare braves alike, despairing of my life, began
each to take thought for himself. While I was in this condition,
the begs, by an error of judgment, shewed me to a servant of
Aūzūn Ḥasan’s, a messenger come with wild proposals, and
then dismissed him. In four or five days, I became somewhat
better but still could not speak, in another few days, was
myself again.</p>

<p>Such letters! so anxious, so beseeching, coming from my
mothers, that is from my own and hers, Aīsān-daulat Begīm,
and from my teacher and spiritual guide, that is, Khwāja-i-maulānā-i-qāẓī,
with what heart would a man not move? We
left Samarkand for Andijān on a Saturday in Rajab (Feb.-March),
when I had ruled 100 days in the town. It was<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;53b.</span>
Saturday again when we reached Khujand and on that day a
person brought news from Andijān, that seven days before, that
is on the very day we had left Samarkand, ‘Alī-dost T̤aghāī had
surrendered Andijān.</p>

<p>These are the particulars;&mdash;The servant of Aūzūn Ḥasan who,
after seeing me, was allowed to leave, had gone to Andijān and
there said, ‘The <i>pādshāh</i> cannot speak and they are dropping
water into his mouth with cotton.’ Having gone and made
these assertions in the ordinary way, he took oath in ‘Alī-dost
T̤aghāī’s presence. ‘Alī-dost T̤aghāī was in the Khākān Gate.
Becoming without footing through this matter, he invited the
opposite party into the fort, made covenant and treaty with
them, and surrendered Andijān. Of provisions and of fighting
men, there was no lack whatever; the starting point of the
surrender was the cowardice of that false and faithless
manikin; what was told him, he made a pretext to put himself
in the right.</p>

<p>When the enemy, after taking possession of Andijān, heard
of my arrival in Khujand, they martyred Khwāja-i-maulānā-i-qāẓī

He had come to be known as Khwāja-maulānā-i-qāẓī but his
own name was ‘Abdu’l-lāh. On his father’s side, his line went
back to Shaikh Burhānu’d-dīn ‘Alī <i>Qīlīch</i>, on his mother’s to
Sl. Aīlīk <i>Māẓī</i>. This family had come to be the Religious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>

in the Farghāna country.<a name="FNanchor_417" id="FNanchor_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">417</a> He was a disciple of his Highness
‘Ubaidu’l-lāh (<i>Aḥrārī</i>) and from him had his upbringing. I
have no doubt he was a saint (<i>walī</i>); what better witnesses to
his sanctity than the fact that within a short time, no sign or
trace remained of those active for his death? He was a
wonderful man; it was not in him to be afraid; in no other
man was seen such courage as his. This quality is a further
witness to his sanctity. Other men, however bold, have
anxieties and tremours; he had none. When they had killed
him, they seized and plundered those connected with him,
retainers and servants, tribesmen and followers.</p>

<p>In anxiety for Andijān, we had given Samarkand out of our
hands; then heard we had lost Andijān. It was like the saying,
‘In ignorance, made to leave this place, shut out from that’
(<i>Ghafil az īn jā rānda, az ān jā mānda</i>). It was very hard and
vexing to me; for why? never since I had ruled, had I been cut
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;54b.</span>off like this from my retainers and my country; never since I
had known myself, had I known such annoyance and such
hardship.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>f. Bābur’s action from Khujand as his base.</i>)</p>

<p>On our arrival in Khujand, certain hypocrites, not enduring
to see Khalīfa in my Gate, had so wrought on Muḥammad
Ḥusain Mīrzā <i>Dūghlāt</i> and others that he was dismissed
towards Tāshkīnt. To Tāshkīnt also Qāsim Beg <i>Qūchīn</i> had
been sent earlier, in order to ask The Khān’s help for a move
on Andijān. The Khān consented to give it and came himself
by way of the Ahangarān Dale,<a name="FNanchor_418" id="FNanchor_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">418</a> to the foot of the Kīndīrlīk
Pass.<a name="FNanchor_419" id="FNanchor_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">419</a> There I went also, from Khujand, and saw my Khān
dādā.<a name="FNanchor_420" id="FNanchor_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">420</a> We then crossed the pass and halted on the Akhsī side.
The enemy for their part, gathered their men and went to
Akhsī.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>
<p>Just at that time, the people in Pāp<a name="FNanchor_421" id="FNanchor_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">421</a> sent me word they had
made fast the fort but, owing to something misleading in The
Khān’s advance, the enemy stormed and took it. Though
The Khān had other good qualities and was in other ways
businesslike, he was much without merit as a soldier and
commander. Just when matters were at the point that if he
made one more march, it was most probable the country would
be had without fighting, at such a time! he gave ear to what
the enemy said with alloy of deceit, spoke of peace and, as his
messengers, sent them Khwāja Abū’l-makāram and his own<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;55.</span>
Lord of the Gate, Beg <i>Tilba</i> (Fool), <i>Taṃbal’s</i> elder brother.
To save themselves those others (<i>i.e.</i> Ḥasan and Taṃbal) mixed
something true with what they fabled and agreed to give gifts
and bribes either to The Khān or to his intermediaries. With
this, The Khān retired.</p>

<p>As the families of most of my begs and household and braves
were in Andijān, 7 or 800 of the great and lesser begs and bare
braves, left us in despair of our taking the place. Of the begs
were ‘Alī-darwesh Beg, ‘Alī-mazīd <i>Qūchīn</i>, Muḥammad Bāqir
Beg, Shaikh ‘Abdu’l-lāh, Lord of the Gate and Mīrīm <i>Lāgharī</i>.
Of men choosing exile and hardship with me, there may have
been, of good and bad, between 200 and 300. Of begs there
were Qāsim <i>Qūchīn</i> Beg, Wais <i>Lāgharī</i> Beg, Ibrāhīm <i>Sārū
Mīnglīgh</i> Beg, Shīrīm T̤aghāī, Sayyidī Qarā Beg; and of my
household, Mīr Shāh <i>Qūchīn</i>, Sayyid Qāsim <i>Jalāīr</i>, Lord of the
Gate, Qāsim-‘ajab, ‘Alī-dost T̤aghāī’s (son) Muḥammad-dost,
Muḥammad-‘alī <i>Mubashir</i>,<a name="FNanchor_422" id="FNanchor_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">422</a> Khudāī-bīrdī <i>Tūghchī Mughūl</i>, Yārīk

<p>It came very hard on me; I could not help crying a good
deal. Back I went to Khujand and thither they sent me my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>mother and my grandmother and the families of some of the
men with me.</p>

<p>That Ramẓān (April-May) we spent in Khujand, then
mounted for Samarkand. We had already sent to ask The
Khān’s help; he assigned, to act with us against Samarkand,
his son, Sl. Muḥammad (Sult̤ānīm) Khānika and (his son’s
guardian) Aḥmad Beg with 4 or 5000 men and rode himself as
far as Aūrā-tīpā. There I saw him and from there went on
by way of Yār-yīlāq, past the Būrka-yīlāq Fort, the head-quarters
of the sub-governor (<i>dārogha</i>) of the district. Sl.
Muḥammad Sult̤ān and Aḥmad Beg, riding light and by
another road, got to Yār-yīlāq first but on their hearing that
Shaibānī Khān was raiding Shīrāz and thereabouts, turned
back. There was no help for it! Back I too had to go. Again
I went to Khujand!</p>

<p>As there was in me ambition for rule and desire of conquest,
I did not sit at gaze when once or twice an affair had made no
progress. Now I myself, thinking to make another move for
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;56.</span>Andijān, went to ask The Khān’s help. Over and above this,
it was seven or eight years since I had seen Shāh Begīm<a name="FNanchor_424" id="FNanchor_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">424</a> and
other relations; they also were seen under the same pretext.
After a few days, The Khān appointed Sayyid Muḥammad
Ḥusain (<i>Dūghlāt</i>) and Ayūb <i>Begchīk</i> and Jān-ḥasan <i>Bārīn</i> with
7 or 8000 men to help us. With this help we started, rode
light, through Khujand without a halt, left Kand-i-badām on
the left and so to Nasūkh, 9 or 10 <i>yīghāch</i> of road beyond
Khujand and 3 <i>yīghāch</i> (12-18 m.) from Kand-i-badām, there
set our ladders up and took the fort. It was the melon season;
one kind grown here, known as Ismā‘īl Shaikhī, has a yellow
rind, feels like shagreen leather, has seeds like an apple’s and
flesh four fingers thick. It is a wonderfully delicate melon; no
other such grows thereabout. Next day the Mughūl begs
represented to me, ‘Our fighting men are few; to what would
holding this one fort lead on?’ In truth they were right; of
what use was it to make that fort fast and stay there? Back
once more to Khujand!</p>

<p>This year Khusrau Shāh, taking Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā with
him, led his army (from Qūndūz) to Chaghānīān and with false
and treacherous intent, sent this message to Ḥiṣār for Sl.
Mas‘ūd Mīrzā, ‘Come, betake yourself to Samarkand; if<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;56b.</span>
Samarkand is taken, one Mīrzā may seat himself there, the
other in Ḥiṣār.’ Just at the time, the Mīrzā’s begs and household
were displeased with him, because he had shewn excessive
favour to his father-in-law, Shaikh ‘Abdu’l-lāh <i>Barlās</i> who from
Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā had gone to him. Small district though
Ḥiṣār is, the Mīrzā had made the Shaikh’s allowance 1,000
<i>tūmāns</i> of <i>fulūs</i><a name="FNanchor_426" id="FNanchor_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">426</a> and had given him the whole of Khutlān in
which were the holdings of many of the Mīrzā’s begs and
household. All this Shaikh ‘Abdu’l-lāh had; he and his sons
took also in whole and in part, the control of the Mīrzā’s gate.
Those angered began, one after the other, to desert to Bāī-sunghar
Mīrzā.</p>

<p>By those words of false alloy, having put Sl. Mas‘ūd Mīrzā
off his guard, Khusrau Shāh and Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā moved
light out of Chaghānīān, surrounded Ḥiṣār and, at beat of
morning-drum, took possession of it. Sl. Mas‘ūd Mīrzā was in
Daulat Sarāī, a house his father had built in the suburbs. Not
being able to get into the fort, he drew off towards Khutlān
with Shaikh ‘Abu’l-lāh <i>Barlās</i>, parted from him half-way,
crossed the river at the Aūbāj ferry and betook himself to Sl.
Ḥusain Mīrzā. Khusrau Shāh, having taken Ḥiṣār, set Bāī-sunghar<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;57.</span>
Mīrzā on the throne, gave Khutlān to his own younger
brother, Walī and rode a few days later, to lay siege to Balkh
where, with many of his father’s begs, was Ibrāhīm Ḥusain
Mīrzā (<i>Bāī-qarā</i>). He sent Naz̤ar <i>Bahādur</i>, his chief retainer,
on in advance with 3 or 400 men to near Balkh, and himself
taking Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā with him, followed and laid the siege.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p><p>Walī he sent off with a large force to besiege Shabarghān and
raid and ravage thereabouts. Walī, for his part, not being
able to lay close siege, sent his men off to plunder the clans
and hordes of the Zardak Chūl, and they took him back
over 100,000 sheep and some 3000 camels. He then came,
plundering the Sān-chīrīk country on his way, and raiding and
making captive the clans fortified in the hills, to join Khusrau
Shāh before Balkh.</p>

<p>One day during the siege, Khusrau Shāh sent the Naz̤ar
<i>Bahādur</i> already mentioned, to destroy the water-channels<a name="FNanchor_427" id="FNanchor_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">427</a> of
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;57b.</span>Balkh. Out on him sallied Tīngrī-bīrdī <i>Samānchī</i>,<a name="FNanchor_428" id="FNanchor_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">428</a> Sl. Ḥusain
Mīrzā’s favourite beg, with 70 or 80 men, struck him down, cut
off his head, carried it off, and went back into the fort. A very
bold sally, and he did a striking deed.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>g. Affairs of Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā and Badī‘u’z-zamān Mīrzā.</i>)</p>

<p>This same year, Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā led his army out to Bast
and there encamped,<a name="FNanchor_429" id="FNanchor_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">429</a> for the purpose of putting down Ẕū’n-nūn
<i>Arghūn</i> and his son, Shāh Shujā‘, because they had become
Badī‘u’z-zamān Mīrzā’s retainers, had given him a daughter of
Ẕū’n-nūn in marriage and taken up a position hostile to himself.
No corn for his army coming in from any quarter, it had begun
to be distressed with hunger when the sub-governor of Bast
surrendered. By help of the stores of Bast, the Mīrzā got back
to Khurāsān.</p>

<p>Since such a great ruler as Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā had twice led a
splendid and well-appointed army out and twice retired, without
taking Qūndūz, or Ḥiṣār or Qandahār, his sons and his
begs waxed bold in revolt and rebellion. In the spring of this
year, he sent a large army under Muḥammad Walī Beg to put
down (his son) Muḥammad Ḥusain Mīrzā who, supreme in
Astarābād, had taken up a position hostile to himself. While
Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā was still lying in the Nīshīn meadow (near
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>Harāt), he was surprised by Badī‘u’z-zamān Mīrzā and Shāh
Shujā‘ Beg (<i>Arghūn</i>). By unexpected good-fortune, he had been<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;58.</span>
joined that very day by Sl. Mas‘ūd Mīrzā, a refugee after
bringing about the loss of Ḥiṣār,<a name="FNanchor_430" id="FNanchor_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">430</a> and also rejoined by a force
of his own returning from Astarābād. There was no question
of fighting. Badī‘u’z-zamān Mīrzā and Shāh Beg, brought
face to face with these armies, took to flight.</p>

<p>Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā looked kindly on Sl. Mas‘ūd Mīrzā, made
him kneel as a son-in-law and gave him a place in his favour
and affection. None-the-less Sl. Mas‘ūd Mīrzā, at the instigation
of Bāqī <i>Chaghānīānī</i>, who had come earlier into Sl. Ḥusain
Mīrzā’s service, started off on some pretext, without asking
leave, and went from the presence of Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā to that
of Khusrau Shāh!</p>

<p>Khusrau Shāh had already invited and brought from Ḥiṣār,
Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā; to him had gone Aūlūgh Beg Mīrzā’s son,<a name="FNanchor_431" id="FNanchor_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">431</a>
Mīrān-shāh Mīrzā who, having gone amongst the Hazāra in
rebellion against his father, had been unable to remain amongst
them because of his own immoderate acts. Some short-sighted
persons were themselves ready to kill these three (Tīmūrid)
Mīrzās and to read Khusrau Shāh’s name in the <i>khut̤ba</i> but he
himself did not think this combination desirable. The ungrateful<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;58b.</span>
manikin however, for the sake of gain in this five days’
fleeting world,&mdash;it was not true to him nor will it be true to any
man soever,&mdash;seized that Sl. Mas‘ūd Mīrzā whom he had seen
grow up in his charge from childhood, whose guardian he had
been, and blinded him with the lancet.</p>

<p>Some of the Mīrzā’s foster-brethren and friends of affection
and old servants took him to Kesh intending to convey him to
his (half)-brother Sl. ‘Alī Mīrzā in Samarkand but as that
party also (<i>i.e.</i> ‘Alī’s) became threatening, they fled with him,
crossed the river at the Aūbāj ferry and went to Sl. Ḥusain
Mīrzā.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>
<p>A hundred thousand curses light on him who planned and
did a deed so horrible! Up to the very verge of Resurrection,
let him who hears of this act of Khusrau Shāh, curse him; and
may he who hearing, curses not, know cursing equally deserved!</p>

<p>This horrid deed done, Khusrau Shāh made Bāī-sunghar
Mīrzā ruler in Ḥiṣār and dismissed him; Mīrān-shāh Mīrzā he
despatched for Bāmīān with Sayyid Qāsim to help him.</p>

and to ask of him the loan for the winter of Pashāghar where
we might sit till it was practicable to make a move on
Samarkand. He consenting, I rode out from Khujand for
Pashāghar.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(<i>Author’s note on Pashāghar.</i>) Pashāghar is one of the villages of

Mīrzā.</p></div>

<p>I had fever when we reached Zamīn, but spite of my
fever we hurried off by the mountain road till we came
over against Rabāt̤-i-khwāja, the head-quarters of the sub-governor
of the Shavdār <i>tūmān</i>, where we hoped to take the
garrison at unawares, set our ladders up and so get into the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>fort. We reached it at dawn, found its men on guard, turned
back and rode without halt to Pashāghar. The pains and
misery of fever notwithstanding, I had ridden 14 or 15 <i>yīghāch</i>
(70 to 80 miles).</p>

<p>After a few days in Pashāghar, we appointed Ibrāhīm <i>Sārū</i>,
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;59b.</span>Wais <i>Lāgharī</i>, Sherīm T̤aghāī and some of the household and
braves to make an expedition amongst the Yār-yīlāq forts and
get them into our hands. Yār-yīlāq, at that time was Sayyid
Yūsuf Beg’s,<a name="FNanchor_436" id="FNanchor_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">436</a> he having remained in Samarkand at the exodus
and been much favoured by Sl. ‘Ali Mīrzā. To manage the
forts, Sayyid Yūsuf had sent his younger brother’s son, Aḥmad-i-yūsuf,
now<a name="FNanchor_437" id="FNanchor_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">437</a> Governor of Sialkot, and Aḥmad-i-yūsuf was then
in occupation. In the course of that winter, our begs and
braves made the round, got possession of some of the forts
peacefully, fought and took others, gained some by ruse and
craft. In the whole of that district there is perhaps not a
single village without its defences because of the Mughūls and
the Aūzbegs. Meantime Sl. ‘Alī Mīrzā became suspicious of
Sayyid Yūsuf and his nephew on my account and dismissed
both towards Khurāsān.</p>

<p>The winter passed in this sort of tug-of-war; with the oncoming
heats,<a name="FNanchor_438" id="FNanchor_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">438</a> they sent Khwāja Yaḥya to treat with me, while
they, urged on by the (Samarkand) army, marched out to near
Shīrāz and Kabud. I may have had 200 or 300 soldiers
(<i>sipāhī</i>); powerful foes were on my every side; Fortune had
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;60.</span>not favoured me when I turned to Andijān; when I put a hand
out for Samarkand, no work was opened out. Of necessity,
some sort of terms were made and I went back from Pashāghar.</p>

<p>Khujand is a poor place; one beg would have a hard time in
it; there we and our families and following had been for half a

not been backward in bearing our charges and serving us to the
best of their power. With what face could we go there again?
and what, for his own part, could a man do there? ‘To what
home to go? For what gain to stay?’<a name="FNanchor_440" id="FNanchor_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">440</a></p>

<p>In the end and with the same anxieties and uncertainty, we
went to the summer-pastures in the south of Aūrā-tīpā. There
we spent some days in amazement at our position, not knowing
where to go or where to stay, our heads in a whirl. On one of
those days, Khwāja Abū’l-makāram came to see me, he like
me, a wanderer, driven from his home.<a name="FNanchor_441" id="FNanchor_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">441</a> He questioned us
about our goings and stayings, about what had or had not been

compassion for our state and recited the <i>fātiḥa</i> for me before he
left. I also was much touched; I pitied him.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>b. Bābur recovers Marghīnān.</i>)</p>

<p>Near the Afternoon Prayer of that same day, a horseman
appeared at the foot of the valley. He was a man named
Yūl-chūq, presumably ‘Ali-dost T̤aghāī’s own servant, and had
been sent with this written message, ‘Although many great
misdeeds have had their rise in me, yet, if you will do me the<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;60b.</span>

reflecting, without a moment’s delay, just as if for a sudden

till shoot of dawn, and through the next day till sunset, and on
through that night till, just before dawn, we were one <i>yīghāch</i>
from Marghīnān. Here Wais Beg and others represented to
me with some anxiety what sort of an evil-doer ‘Ali-dost was.
‘No-one,’ they said, ‘has come and gone, time and again,
between him and us; no terms and compact have been made;
trusting to what are we going?’ In truth their fears were
just! After waiting awhile to consult, we at last agreed that
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;61.</span>reasonable as anxiety was, it ought to have been earlier; that
there we were after coming three nights and two days without
rest or halt; in what horse or in what man was any strength
left?&mdash;from where we were, how could return be made? and,
if made, where were we to go?&mdash;that, having come so far, on
we must, and that nothing happens without God’s will. At
this we left the matter and moved on, our trust set on Him.</p>

<p>At the Sunnat Prayer<a name="FNanchor_444" id="FNanchor_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">444</a> we reached Fort Marghīnān. ‘Alī-dost
T̤aghāī kept himself behind (<i>arqa</i>) the closed gate and
asked for terms; these granted, he opened it. He did me
obeisance between the (two) gates.<a name="FNanchor_445" id="FNanchor_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">445</a> After seeing him, we
dismounted at a suitable house in the walled-town. With me,
great and small, were 240 men.</p>

<p>As Aūzūn Ḥasan and Taṃbal had been tyrannical and
oppressive, all the clans of the country were asking for me.
We therefore, after two or three days spent in Marghīnān,
joined to Qāsim Beg over a hundred men of the Pashāgharīs,
the new retainers of Marghīnān and of ‘Alī-dost’s following,
and sent them to bring over to me, by force or fair words, such
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>hill-people of the south of Andijān as the Ashpārī, Tūrūqshār,<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;61b.</span>
Chīkrāk and others roundabout. Ibrāhīm Sārū and Wais
<i>Lāgharī</i> and Sayyidī Qarā were also sent out, to cross the
Khujand-water and, by whatever means, to induce the people
on that side to turn their eyes to me.</p>

<p>Aūzūn Ḥasan and Taṃbal, for their parts, gathered together
what soldiers and Mughūls they had and called up the men
accustomed to serve in the Andijān and Akhsī armies. Then,
bringing Jahāngīr Mīrzā with them, they came to Sapān, a
village 2 m. east of Marghīnān, a few days after our arrival, and
dismounted there with the intention of besieging Marghīnān.
They advanced a day or two later, formed up to fight, as far as
the suburbs. Though after the departure of the Commanders,
Qāsim Beg, Ibrāhīm <i>Sārū</i> and Wais <i>Lāgharī</i>, few men were
left with me, those there were formed up, sallied out and prevented
the enemy from advancing beyond the suburbs. On
that day, Page Khalīl, the turban-twister, went well forward
and got his hand into the work. They had come; they could
do nothing; on two other days they failed to get near the fort.<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;62.</span></p>

<p>When Qāsim Beg went into the hills on the south of Andijān,
all the Ashpārī, Tūrūqshār, Chīkrāk, and the peasants and
highland and lowland clans came in for us. When the Commanders,
Ibrāhīm <i>Sārū</i> and Wais <i>Lāgharī</i>, crossed the river to
the Akhsī side, Pāp and several other forts came in.</p>

<p>Aūzūn Ḥasan and Taṃbal being the heathenish and vicious
tyrants they were, had inflicted great misery on the peasantry
and clansmen. One of the chief men of Akhsī, Ḥasan-dīkcha
by name,<a name="FNanchor_446" id="FNanchor_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">446</a> gathered together his own following and a body of
the Akhsī mob and rabble, black-bludgeoned<a name="FNanchor_447" id="FNanchor_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">447</a> Aūzūn Ḥasan’s
and Taṃbal’s men in the outer fort and drubbed them into the
citadel. They then invited the Commanders, Ibrāhīm <i>Sārū</i>,
Wais <i>Lāgharī</i> and Sayyidī Qarā and admitted them into the fort.</p>

<p>Sl. Maḥmūd Khān had appointed to help us, Ḥaidar
<i>Kūkūldāsh’s</i> (son) Banda-‘alī and Ḥājī Ghāzī <i>Manghīt</i>,<a name="FNanchor_448" id="FNanchor_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">448</a> the latter
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>just then a fugitive from Shaibānī Khān, and also the Bārīn
<i>tūmān</i> with its begs. They arrived precisely at this time.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;62b.</span>These news were altogether upsetting to Aūzūn Ḥasan;
he at once started off his most favoured retainers and most
serviceable braves to help his men in the citadel of Akhsī. His
force reached the brow of the river at dawn. Our Commanders
and the (Tāshkīnt) Mughūls had heard of its approach and had
made some of their men strip their horses and cross the river
(to the Andijān side). Aūzūn Ḥasan’s men, in their haste, did
not draw the ferry-boat up-stream;<a name="FNanchor_449" id="FNanchor_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">449</a> they consequently went
right away from the landing-place, could not cross for the fort
and went down stream.<a name="FNanchor_450" id="FNanchor_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">450</a> Here-upon, our men and the
(Tāshkīnt) Mughūls began to ride bare-back into the water
from both banks. Those in the boat could make no fight at
all. Qārlūghāch (var. Qārbūghāch) <i>Bakhshī</i> (Pay-master)
called one of Mughūl Beg’s sons to him, took him by the
hand, chopped at him and killed him. Of what use was it?
The affair was past that! His act was the cause why most of
those in the boat went to their death. Instantly our men
seized them all (<i>arīq</i>) and killed all (but a few).<a name="FNanchor_451" id="FNanchor_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">451</a> Of Aūzūn
Ḥasan’s confidants escaped Qārlūghāch <i>Bakhshī</i> and Khalīl
<i>Dīwān</i> and Qāẓī <i>Ghulām</i>, the last getting off by pretending to
be a slave (<i>ghulām</i>); and of his trusted braves, Sayyid ‘Alī,
now in trust in my own service,<a name="FNanchor_452" id="FNanchor_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">452</a> and Ḥaidar-i-qulī and Qilka
<i>Kāshgharī</i> escaped. Of his 70 or 80 men, no more than this
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;63.</span>same poor five or six got free.</p>

<p>On hearing of this affair, Aūzūn Ḥasan and Taṃbal, not
being able to remain near Marghīnān, marched in haste and
disorder for Andijān. There they had left Nāṣir Beg, the
husband of Aūzūn Ḥasan’s sister. He, if not Aūzūn Ḥasan’s
second, what question is there he was his third?<a name="FNanchor_453" id="FNanchor_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">453</a> He was an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>experienced man, brave too; when he heard particulars, he
knew their ground was lost, made Andijān fast and sent a man
to me. They broke up in disaccord when they found the fort
made fast against them; Aūzūn Ḥasan drew off to his wife in
Akhsī, Taṃbal to his district of Aūsh. A few of Jahāngīr
Mīrzā’s household and braves fled with him from Aūzūn Ḥasan
and joined Taṃbal before he had reached Aūsh.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>c. Bābur recovers Andijān.</i>)</p>

<p>Directly we heard that Andijān had been made fast against
them, I rode out, at sun-rise, from Marghīnān and by mid-day
was in Andijān.<a name="FNanchor_454" id="FNanchor_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">454</a> There I saw Nāṣir Beg and his two sons,
that is to say, Dost Beg and Mīrīm Beg, questioned them and
uplifted their heads with hope of favour and kindness. In this
way, by God’s grace, my father’s country, lost to me for two
years, was regained and re-possessed, in the month Ẕū’l-qa‘da of<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;63b.</span>
the date 904 (June 1498).<a name="FNanchor_455" id="FNanchor_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">455</a></p>

<p>Sl. Aḥmad Taṃbal, after being joined by Jahāngīr Mīrzā,
drew away for Aūsh. On his entering the town, the red rabble
(<i>qīzīl ayāq</i>) there, as in Akhsī, black-bludgeoned (<i>qarā tīyāq qīlīb</i>)
and drubbed his men out, blow upon blow, then kept the fort
for me and sent me a man. Jahāngīr and Taṃbal went off
confounded, with a few followers only, and entered Aūzkīnt
Fort.</p>

<p>Of Aūzūn Ḥasan news came that after failing to get into
Andijān, he had gone to Akhsī and, it was understood, had
entered the citadel. He had been head and chief in the rebellion;
we therefore, on getting this news, without more than
four or five days’ delay in Andijān, set out for Akhsī. On our
arrival, there was nothing for him to do but ask for peace and
terms, and surrender the fort.</p>

<p>We stayed in Akhsī<a name="FNanchor_456" id="FNanchor_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">456</a> a few days in order to settle its affairs
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>and those of Kāsān and that country-side. We gave the
Mughūls who had come in to help us, leave for return (to
Tāshkīnt), then went back to Andijān, taking with us Aūzūn
Ḥasan and his family and dependants. In Akhsī was left,
for a time, Qāsim-i-‘ajab (Wonderful Qāsim), formerly one of
the household circle, now arrived at beg’s rank.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>d. Renewed rebellion of the Mughūls.</i>)</p>

<p>As terms had been made, Aūzūn Ḥasan, without hurt to life
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;64.</span>or goods, was allowed to go by the Qarā-tīgīn road for Ḥiṣār.
A few of his retainers went with him, the rest parted from him
and stayed behind. These were the men who in the throneless
times had captured and plundered various Musalmān
dependants of my own and of the Khwāja. In agreement
with several begs, their affair was left at this;&mdash;‘This very
band have been the captors and plunderers of our faithful
Musalmān dependants;<a name="FNanchor_457" id="FNanchor_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">457</a> what loyalty have they shown to
their own (Mughūl) begs that they should be loyal to us? If
we had them seized and stripped bare, where would be the
wrong? and this especially because they might be going about,
before our very eyes, riding our horses, wearing our coats,
eating our sheep. Who could put up with that? If, out of
humanity, they are not imprisoned and not plundered, they
certainly ought to take it as a favour if they get off with the
order to give back to our companions of the hard guerilla
times, whatever goods of theirs are known to be here.’</p>

<p>In truth this seemed reasonable; our men were ordered to
take what they knew to be theirs. Reasonable and just though
the order was, (I now) understand that it was a little hasty.
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;64b.</span>With a worry like Jahāngīr seated at my side, there was no
sense in frightening people in this way. In conquest and
government, though many things may have an outside appearance
of reason and justice, yet 100,000 reflections are right and
necessary as to the bearings of each one of them. From this
single incautious order of ours,<a name="FNanchor_458" id="FNanchor_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">458</a> what troubles! what rebellions
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>arose! In the end this same ill-considered order was the cause
of our second exile from Andijān. Now, through it, the
Mughūls gave way to anxiety and fear, marched through
Rabāt̤ik-aūrchīnī, that is, Aīkī-sū-ārāsī, for Aūzkīnt and sent a
man to Taṃbal.</p>

<p>In my mother’s service were 1500 to 2000 Mughūls from the
horde; as many more had come from Ḥiṣār with Ḥamza
Sl. and Mahdī Sl. and Muḥammad <i>Dūghlāt Ḥiṣārī</i>.<a name="FNanchor_459" id="FNanchor_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">459</a> Mischief
and devastation must always be expected from the Mughūl
horde. Up to now<a name="FNanchor_460" id="FNanchor_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">460</a> they have rebelled five times against me.
It must not be understood that they rebelled through not
getting on with me; they have done the same thing with their
own Khāns, again and again. Sl. Qulī <i>Chūnāq</i><a name="FNanchor_461" id="FNanchor_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">461</a> brought me
the news. His late father, Khudāī-bīrdī <i>Būqāq</i><a name="FNanchor_462" id="FNanchor_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">462</a> I had favoured
amongst the Mughūls; he was himself with the (rebel) Mughūls<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;65.</span>
and he did well in thus leaving the horde and his own family
to bring me the news. Well as he did then however, he, as will
be told,<a name="FNanchor_463" id="FNanchor_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">463</a> did a thing so shameful later on that it would hide
a hundred such good deeds as this, if he had done them. His
later action was the clear product of his Mughūl nature. When
this news came, the begs, gathered for counsel, represented to
me, ‘This is a trifling matter; what need for the pādshāh to
ride out? Let Qāsim Beg go with the begs and men assembled
here.’ So it was settled; they took it lightly; to do so must
have been an error of judgment. Qāsim Beg led his force out
that same day; Taṃbal meantime must have joined the
Mughūls. Our men crossed the Aīlāīsh river<a name="FNanchor_464" id="FNanchor_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">464</a> early next morning
by the Yāsī-kījīt (Broad-crossing) and at once came face to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>face with the rebels. Well did they chop at one another
(<i>chāpqūlāshūrlār</i>)! Qāsim Beg himself came face to face with
Muḥammad <i>Arghūn</i> and did not desist from chopping at him
in order to cut off his head.<a name="FNanchor_465" id="FNanchor_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">465</a> Most of our braves exchanged
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;65b.</span>good blows but in the end were beaten. Qāsim Beg, ‘Alī-dost
T̤aghāī, Ibrāhīm <i>Sārū</i>, Wais <i>Lāgharī</i>, Sayyidī Qarā and three
or four more of our begs and household got away but most of
the rest fell into the hands of the rebels. Amongst them were
‘Alī-darwesh Beg and Mīrīm <i>Lāgharī</i> and (Sherīm?) T̤aghāī
Beg’s (son) Tūqā<a name="FNanchor_466" id="FNanchor_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">466</a> and ‘Alī-dost’s son, Muḥammad-dost and
Mīr Shāh <i>Qūchīn</i> and Mīrīm Dīwān.</p>

<p>Two braves chopped very well at one another; on our side,
Samad, Ibrāhīm <i>Sārū’s</i> younger brother, and on their side,
Shāh-suwār, one of the Ḥiṣārī Mughūls. Shāh-suwār struck
so that his sword drove through Samad’s helm and seated
itself well in his head; Samad, spite of his wound, struck so
that his sword cut off Shāh-suwār’s head a piece of bone as
large as the palm of a hand. Shāh-suwār must have worn no
helm; they trepanned his head and it healed; there was no
one to trepan Samad’s and in a few days, he departed simply
through the wound.<a name="FNanchor_467" id="FNanchor_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">467</a></p>

<p>Amazingly unseasonable was this defeat, coming as it did
just in the respite from guerilla fighting and just when we had
regained the country. One of our great props, Qaṃbar-‘alī
<i>Mughūl</i> (the Skinner) had gone to his district when Andijān
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;66.</span>was occupied and therefore was not with us.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>e. Taṃbal attempts to take Andijān.</i>)</p>

<p>Having effected so much, Taṃbal, bringing Jahāngīr Mīrzā
with him, came to the east of Andijān and dismounted 2 miles
off, in the meadow lying in front of the Hill of Pleasure (‘Aīsh).<a name="FNanchor_468" id="FNanchor_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">468</a></p>

to the town side of the hill but, as our braves went
out arrayed to fight, beyond the gardens and suburbs, he could
not advance further and returned to the other side of the hill.
On his first coming to those parts, he killed two of the begs he
had captured, Mīrīm <i>Lāgharī</i> and Tūqā Beg. For nearly a
month he lay round-about without effecting anything; after
that he retired, his face set for Aūsh. Aūsh had been given to
Ibrāhīm <i>Sārū</i> and his man in it now made it fast.</p>

<p>Commissaries were sent gallopping off at once, some to call
up the horse and foot of the district-armies, others to urge
return on Qaṃbar-‘alī and whoever else was away in his own
district, while energetic people were told off to get together
mantelets (<i>tūra</i>), shovels, axes and the what-not of war-material
and stores for the men already with us.</p>

<p>As soon as the horse and foot, called up from the various
districts to join the army, and the soldiers and retainers who
had been scattered to this and that side on their own affairs,
were gathered together, I went out, on Muḥarram 18th.
(August 25th.), putting my trust in God, to Ḥāfiẓ Beg’s Four-gardens
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;66b.</span>and there stayed a few days in order to complete our
equipment. This done, we formed up in array of right and
left, centre and van, horse and foot, and started direct for Aūsh
against our foe.</p>

<p>On approaching Aūsh, news was had that Taṃbal, unable to
make stand in that neighbourhood, had drawn off to the north,
to the Rabāt̤-i-sarhang sub-district, it was understood. That
night we dismounted in Lāt-kīnt. Next day as we were passing
through Aūsh, news came that Taṃbal was understood to have
gone to Andijān. We, for our part, marched on as for Aūzkīnt,
detaching raiders ahead to over-run those parts.<a name="FNanchor_471" id="FNanchor_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">471</a> Our opponents
went to Andijān and at night got into the ditch but being discovered
by the garrison when they set their ladders up against
the ramparts, could effect no more and retired. Our raiders
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>retired also after over-running round about Aūzkīnt without
getting into their hands anything worth their trouble.</p>

<p>Taṃbal had stationed his younger brother, Khalīl, with 200
or 300 men, in Māḏū,<a name="FNanchor_472" id="FNanchor_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">472</a> one of the forts of Aūsh, renowned in
that centre (<i>ārā</i>) for its strength. We turned back (on the<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;67.</span>
Aūzkīnt road) to assault it. It is exceedingly strong. Its
northern face stands very high above the bed of a torrent;
arrows shot from the bed might perhaps reach the ramparts.
On this side is the water-thief,<a name="FNanchor_473" id="FNanchor_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">473</a> made like a lane, with ramparts
on both sides carried from the fort to the water. Towards the
rising ground, on the other sides of the fort, there is a ditch.
The torrent being so near, those occupying the fort had carried
stones in from it as large as those for large mortars.<a name="FNanchor_474" id="FNanchor_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">474</a> From no
fort of its class we have ever attacked, have stones been thrown
so large as those taken into Māḏū. They dropped such a large

when he went up under the ramparts, that he spun head over
heels and came rolling and rolling, without once getting to his
feet, from that great height down to the foot of the glacis
(<i>khāk-rez</i>). He did not trouble himself about it at all but just
got on his horse and rode off. Again, a stone flung from the
double water-way, hit Yār-‘alī <i>Balāl</i> so hard on the head that
in the end it had to be trepanned.<a name="FNanchor_476" id="FNanchor_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">476</a> Many of our men perished
by their stones. The assault began at dawn; the water-thief<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;67b.</span>
had been taken before breakfast-time;<a name="FNanchor_477" id="FNanchor_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">477</a> fighting went on till
evening; next morning, as they could not hold out after losing
the water-thief, they asked for terms and came out. We took
60 or 70 or 80 men of Khalīl’s command and sent them to
Andijān for safe-keeping; as some of our begs and household
were prisoners in their hands, the Māḏū affair fell out very well.<a name="FNanchor_478" id="FNanchor_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">478</a></p>

Aūsh, and there dismounted. When Taṃbal retired from
Andijān and went into the Rabāt̤-i-sarhang sub-district, he
dismounted in a village called Āb-i-khān. Between him and
me may have been one <i>yīghāch</i> (5 m.?). At such a time as this,
Qaṃbar-‘alī (the Skinner) on account of some sickness, went
into Aūsh.</p>

<p>It was lain in Unjū-tūpa a month or forty days without a
battle, but day after day our foragers and theirs got to grips.
All through the time our camp was mightily well watched at
night; a ditch was dug; where no ditch was, branches were set
close together;<a name="FNanchor_479" id="FNanchor_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">479</a> we also made our soldiers go out in their mail
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;68.</span>along the ditch. Spite of such watchfulness, a night-alarm was
given every two or three days, and the cry to arms went up.
One day when Sayyidī Beg T̤aghāī had gone out with the
foragers, the enemy came up suddenly in greater strength and
took him prisoner right out of the middle of the fight.</p>

<p>He was born in 882 (1477 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>), in the Ḥiṣār district. He
was Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā’s second son, younger than Sl. Mas‘ud
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>M. and older than Sl. ‘Alī M. and Sl. Ḥusain M. and Sl. Wais
M. known as Khān Mīrzā. His mother was Pasha Begīm.<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;68b.</span></p>

<p class="indent">(<i>d. His appearance and characteristics.</i>)</p>

<p>He had large eyes, a fleshy face<a name="FNanchor_481" id="FNanchor_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">481</a> and Turkmān features, was
of middle height and altogether an elegant young man (<i>aet.</i> 22).</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>e. His qualities and manners.</i>)</p>

<p>He was just, humane, pleasant-natured and a most accomplished
scion of sovereignty. His tutor, Sayyid Maḥmūd,<a name="FNanchor_482" id="FNanchor_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">482</a> presumably
was a Shī‘a; through this he himself became infected
by that heresy. People said that latterly, in Samarkand, he
reverted from that evil belief to the pure Faith. He was much
addicted to wine but on his non-drinking days, used to go
through the Prayers.<a name="FNanchor_483" id="FNanchor_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">483</a> He was moderate in gifts and liberality.
He wrote the <i>naskh-ta‘līq</i> character very well; in painting also
his hand was not bad. He made ‘Ādilī his pen-name and
composed good verses but not sufficient to form a <i>dīwān</i>. Here
is the opening couplet (<i>mat̤la‘</i>) of one of them<a name="FNanchor_484" id="FNanchor_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">484</a>;&mdash;</p>

<p>In such repute are his odes held in Samarkand, that they are
to be found in most houses.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>f. His battles.</i>)</p>

<p>He fought two ranged battles. One, fought when he was
first seated on the throne (900 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1495 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>), was with Sl.
Maḥmūd Khān<a name="FNanchor_485" id="FNanchor_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">485</a> who, incited and stirred up by Sl. Junaid
<i>Barlās</i> and others to desire Samarkand, drew an army out,<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;69.</span>
crossed the Āq-kutal and went to Rabāt̤-i-soghd and Kān-bāī.
Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā went out from Samarkand, fought him near
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>Kān-bāī, beat him and beheaded 3 or 4000 Mughūls. In this
fight died Ḥaidar <i>Kūkūldāsh</i>, the Khān’s looser and binder
(<i>ḥall u‘aqdī</i>). His second battle was fought near Bukhārā with
Sl. ‘Alī Mīrzā (901 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1496 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>); in this he was beaten.<a name="FNanchor_486" id="FNanchor_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">486</a></p>

<p class="indent">(<i>g. His countries.</i>)</p>

<p>His father, Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā, gave him Bukhārā; when
Sl. Maḥmūd M. died, his begs assembled and in agreement
made Bāī-sunghar M. ruler in Samarkand. For a time, Bukhārā
was included with Samarkand in his jurisdiction but it went
out of his hands after the Tarkhān rebellion (901 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1496 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>).
When he left Samarkand to go to Khusrau Shāh and I got
possession of it (903 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1497 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>), Khusrau Shāh took Ḥiṣār and
gave it to him.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>h. Other details concerning him.</i>)</p>

<p>He left no child. He took a daughter of his paternal uncle,
Sl. Khalīl Mīrzā, when he went to Khusrau Shāh; he had no
other wife or concubine.</p>

<p>He never ruled with authority so independent that any beg
was heard of as promoted by him to be his confidant; his begs
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;69b.</span>were just those of his father and his paternal uncle (Aḥmad).</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>i. Resumed account of Bābur’s campaign against Taṃbal.</i>)</p>

<p>After Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā’s death, Sl. Aḥmad <i>Qarāwal</i>,<a name="FNanchor_487" id="FNanchor_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">487</a> the
father of Qūch (Qūj) Beg, sent us word (of his intention) and
came to us from Ḥiṣār through the Qarā-tīgīn country, together
with his brethren, elder and younger, and their families and
dependants. From Aūsh too came Qaṃbar-‘alī, risen from his
sickness. Arriving, as it did, at such a moment, we took the
providential help of Sl. Aḥmad and his party for a happy omen.
Next day we formed up at dawn and moved direct upon our
foe. He made no stand at Āb-i-khān but marched from his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>ground, leaving many tents and blankets and things of the
baggage for our men. We dismounted in his camp.</p>

<p>That evening Taṃbal, having Jahāngīr with him, turned our
left and went to a village called Khūbān (var. Khūnān), some
3 <i>yīghāch</i> from us (15 m.?) and between us and Andijān.
Next day we moved out against him, formed up with right and
left, centre and van, our horses in their mail, our men in theirs,
and with foot-soldiers, bearing mantelets, flung to the front.
Our right was ‘Alī-dost and his dependants, our left Ibrāhīm
<i>Sārū</i>, Wais <i>Lāgharī</i>, Sayyidī Qarā, Muḥammad-‘alī <i>Mubashir</i>,
and Khwāja-i-kalān’s elder brother, Kīchīk Beg, with several of<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;70.</span>
the household. In the left were inscribed<a name="FNanchor_488" id="FNanchor_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">488</a> also Sl. Aḥmad
<i>Qarāwal</i> and Qūch Beg with their brethren. With me in the
centre was Qāsim Beg <i>Qūchīn</i>; in the van were Qaṃbar-‘alī
(the Skinner) and some of the household. When we reached
Sāqā, a village two miles east of Khūbān, the enemy came out
of Khūbān, arrayed to fight. We, for our part, moved on the
faster. At the time of engaging, our foot-soldiers, provided
how laboriously with the mantelets! were quite in the rear!
By God’s grace, there was no need of them; our left had got
hands in with their right before they came up. Kīchīk Beg
chopped away very well; next to him ranked Muḥammad ‘Alī
<i>Mubashir</i>. Not being able to bring equal zeal to oppose us, the
enemy took to flight. The fighting did not reach the front of
our van or right. Our men brought in many of their braves;
we ordered the heads of all to be struck off. Favouring caution
and good generalship, our begs, Qāsim Beg and, especially,
‘Alī-dost did not think it advisable to send far in pursuit; for<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;70b.</span>
this reason, many of their men did not fall into our hands. We
dismounted right in Khūbān village. This was my first ranged
battle; the Most High God, of His own favour and mercy,
made it a day of victory and triumph. We accepted the omen.</p>

<p>On the next following day, my father’s mother, my grandmother,
Shāh Sult̤ān Begīm<a name="FNanchor_489" id="FNanchor_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">489</a> arrived from Andijān, thinking to
beg off Jahāngīr Mīrzā if he had been taken.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>j. Bābur goes into winter-quarters in Between-the-two-rivers.</i>)</p>

<p>As it was now almost winter and no grain or fruits<a name="FNanchor_490" id="FNanchor_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">490</a> remained
in the open country, it was not thought desirable to move
against (Taṃbal in) Aūzkīnt but return was made to Andijān.
A few days later, it was settled after consultation, that for us
to winter in the town would in no way hurt or hamper the
enemy, rather that he would wax the stronger by it through
raids and guerilla fighting; moreover on our own account, it
was necessary that we should winter where our men would not
become enfeebled through want of grain and where we could
straiten the enemy by some sort of blockade. For these desirable
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;71.</span>ends we marched out of Andijān, meaning to winter
near Armiyān and Nūsh-āb in the Rabāt̤ik-aūrchīnī, known
also as Between-the-two-rivers. On arriving in the two villages
above-mentioned, we prepared winter-quarters.</p>

<p>The hunting-grounds are good in that neighbourhood; in the
jungle near the Aīlāīsh river is much <i>būghū-marāl</i><a name="FNanchor_491" id="FNanchor_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">491</a> and pig; the
small scattered clumps of jungle are thick with hare and
pheasant; and on the near rising-ground, are many foxes<a name="FNanchor_492" id="FNanchor_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">492</a> of
fine colour and swifter than those of any other place. While
we were in those quarters, I used to ride hunting every two or
three days; we would beat through the great jungle and hunt
<i>būghū-marāl</i>, or we would wander about, making a circle round
scattered clumps and flying our hawks at the pheasants. The
pheasants are unlimited<a name="FNanchor_493" id="FNanchor_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">493</a> there; pheasant-meat was abundant
as long as we were in those quarters.</p>

<p>While we were there, Khudāī-bīrdī <i>Tūghchī</i>, then newly-favoured
with beg’s rank, fell on some of Taṃbal’s raiders and
brought in a few heads. Our braves went out also from Aūsh
and Andijān and raided untiringly on the enemy, driving in his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>herds of horses and much enfeebling him. If the whole winter
had been passed in those quarters, the more probable thing is<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;71b.</span>
that he would have broken up simply without a fight.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>k. Qaṃbar-‘alī again asks leave.</i>)</p>

<p>It was at such a time, just when our foe was growing weak
and helpless, that Qaṃbar-‘alī asked leave to go to his district.
The more he was dissuaded by reminder of the probabilities of
the position, the more stupidity he shewed. An amazingly
fickle and veering manikin he was! It had to be! Leave for
his district was given him. That district had been Khujand
formerly but when Andijān was taken this last time, Asfara
and Kand-i-badām were given him in addition. Amongst our
begs, he was the one with large districts and many followers;
no-one’s land or following equalled his. We had been 40 or 50
days in those winter-quarters. At his recommendation, leave
was given also to some of the clans in the army. We, for our
part, went into Andijān.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>l. Sl. Maḥmūd Khān sends Mughūls to help Taṃbal.</i>)</p>

<p>Both while we were in our winter-quarters and later on in
Andijān, Taṃbal’s people came and went unceasingly between
him and The Khān in Tāshkīnt. His paternal uncle of the full-blood,
Aḥmad Beg, was guardian of The Khān’s son, Sl.
Muḥammad Sl. and high in favour; his elder brother of the
full-blood, Beg Tīlba (Fool), was The Khān’s Lord of the Gate.
After all the comings and goings, these two brought The Khān
to the point of reinforcing Taṃbal. Beg Tīlba, leaving his wife
and domestics and family in Tāshkīnt, came on ahead of the<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;72.</span>
reinforcement and joined his younger brother, Taṃbal,&mdash;Beg
Tīlba! who from his birth up had been in Mughūlistān, had
grown up amongst Mughūls, had never entered a cultivated
country or served the rulers of one, but from first to last had
served The Khāns!</p>

<p>Just then a wonderful (<i>‘ajab</i>) thing happened;<a name="FNanchor_494" id="FNanchor_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">494</a> Qāsim-i-‘ajab

by Bachrātā, met in with a few of Taṃbal’s men and
was made prisoner.</p>

<p>When Taṃbal heard that our army was disbanded and was
assured of The Khān’s help by the arrival of his brother, Beg
Tīlba, who had talked with The Khān, he rode from Aūzkīnt
into Between-the-two-rivers. Meantime safe news had come
to us from Kāsān that The Khān had appointed his son, Sl.
Muḥ. Khānika, commonly known as Sult̤ānīm,<a name="FNanchor_495" id="FNanchor_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">495</a> and Aḥmad

by the Archa-kīnt road<a name="FNanchor_496" id="FNanchor_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">496</a> and were laying siege to Kāsān. Hereupon
we, without delay, without a glance at our absent men,
just with those there were, in the hard cold of winter, put our
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;72b.</span>trust in God and rode off by the Band-i-sālār road to oppose
them. That night we stopped no-where; on we went through
the darkness till, at dawn, we dismounted in Akhsī.<a name="FNanchor_497" id="FNanchor_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">497</a> So
mightily bitter was the cold that night that it bit the hands

Yārak T̤aghāī, temporarily also, in Qāsim-i-‘ajab’s place, passed
on for Kāsān. Two miles from Kāsān news came that on
hearing of our approach, Aḥmad Beg and Sult̤ānīm had hurried
off in disorder.</p>

towards Nū-kīnt. Astonished and perplexed by his elder
brother’s light departure and by our quick arrival, he stopped
short. Said we, ‘It is God has brought them in this fashion!

said, ‘It is late in the day; even if we do not go out today,
where can they go tomorrow? Wherever it is, we will meet<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;73.</span>
them at dawn.’ So they said, not thinking it well to make the
joint effort there and then; so too the enemy, come so opportunely,
broke up and got away without any hurt whatever.
The (Turkī) proverb is, ‘Who does not snatch at a chance,
will worry himself about it till old age.’</p>

<p>Seizing the advantage of a respite till the morrow, the enemy
slipped away in the night, and without dismounting on the road,
went into Fort Archīān. When a morrow’s move against a foe
was made, we found no foe; after him we went and, not thinking
it well to lay close siege to Archīān, dismounted two miles
off (one <i>shar‘ī</i>) in Ghazna-namangān.<a name="FNanchor_503" id="FNanchor_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">503</a> We were in camp there
for 30 or 40 days, Taṃbal being in Fort Archīān. Every now

theirs, fling themselves on one another midway and return.
They made one night-attack, rained arrows in on us and retired.
As the camp was encircled by a ditch or by branches close-set,
and as watch was kept, they could effect no more.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>o. Further action against Taṃbal and an accommodation made.</i>)</p>

<p>Meantime Sayyid Yūsuf of Macham had sent a man to
Taṃbal and was looking towards him. He was the head-man
of one of the two foot-hills of Andijān, Macham and Awīghūr.
Latterly he had become known in my Gate, having outgrown
the head-man and put on the beg, though no-one ever had
made him a beg. He was a singularly hypocritical manikin,
of no standing whatever. From our last taking of Andijān
(June 1499) till then (Feb. 1500), he had revolted two or three
times from Taṃbal and come to me, and two or three times
had revolted from me and gone to Taṃbal. This was his last
change of side. With him were many from the (Mughūl) horde
and tribesmen and clansmen. ‘Don’t let him join Taṃbal,’
we said and rode in between them. We got to Bīshkhārān with
one night’s halt. Taṃbal’s men must have come earlier and
entered the fort. A party of our begs, ‘Alī-darwesh Beg and
Qūch Beg, with his brothers, went close up to the Gate of
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;74.</span>Bīshkhārān and exchanged good blows with the enemy. Qūch
Beg and his brothers did very well there, their hands getting in
for most of the work. We dismounted on a height some two
miles from Bīshkhārān; Taṃbal, having Jahāngīr with him,
dismounted with the fort behind him.</p>

<p>Three or four days later, begs unfriendly to us, that is to say,
‘Alī-dost and Qaṃbar-‘alī, the Skinner, with their followers and
dependants, began to interpose with talk of peace. I and my
well-wishers had no knowledge of a peace and we all<a name="FNanchor_504" id="FNanchor_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">504</a> were
utterly averse from the project. Those two manikins however
were our two great begs; if we gave no ear to their words and
if we did not make peace, other things from them were probable!
It had to be! Peace was made in this fashion;&mdash;the districts
on the Akhsī side of the Khujand-water were to depend on
Jahāngīr, those on the Andijān side, on me; Aūzkīnt was to
be left in my jurisdiction after they had removed their families
from it; when the districts were settled and I and Jahāngīr had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>made our agreement, we (<i>bīz</i>) should march together against
Samarkand; and when I was in possession of Samarkand,
Andijān was to be given to Jahāngīr. So the affair was settled.<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;74b.</span>
Next day,&mdash;it was one of the last of Rajab, (end of Feb. 1500)
Jahāngīr Mīrzā and Taṃbal came and did me obeisance; the
terms and conditions were ratified as stated above; leave for
Akhsī was given to Jahāngīr and I betook myself to Andijān.</p>

<p>On our arrival, Khalīl-of-Taṃbal and our whole band of
prisoners were released; robes of honour were put on them and

dismissed Khalīfa; next seized and plundered Ibrāhīm <i>Sārū</i>

their districts and dismissed them. He entangled himself with
Qāsim Beg and <i>he</i> was made to go; he openly declared, ‘Khalīfa

like son, they set themselves up in this improper way because
they had Taṃbal at their backs. No authority to restrain their
unreasonable misdeeds was left to me; for why? Whatever
their hearts desired, that they did because such a foe of mine
as Taṃbal was their backer. The position was singularly
delicate; not a word was said but many humiliations were

(<i>hikāyat</i>)? In my joy and agitation I could not thank him (for
coming); how was it possible for me to reproach him with
going away? What power had I to command the duty of
service to myself?<a name="FNanchor_508" id="FNanchor_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">508</a> One day, during that time of desire and

suddenly met him face to face, I got into such a state of confusion
that I almost went right off. To look straight at him
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;76.</span>or to put words together was impossible. With a hundred
torments and shames, I went on. A (Persian) couplet of

<p>That couplet suited the case wonderfully well. In that frothing-up
of desire and passion, and under that stress of youthful folly,
I used to wander, bare-head, bare-foot, through street and lane,
orchard and vineyard. I shewed civility neither to friend nor
stranger, took no care for myself or others.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>s. Sl. ‘Alī Mīrzā’s quarrels with the Tarkhāns.</i>)</p>

<p>In this same year, Sl. ‘Alī Mīrzā fell out with Muḥammad
Mazīd Tarkhān for the following reasons;&mdash;The Tarkhāns had
risen to over-much predominance and honour; Bāqī had taken
the whole revenue of the Bukhārā Government and gave not a<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;76b.</span>
half-penny (<i>dāng</i>)<a name="FNanchor_510" id="FNanchor_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">510</a> to any-one else; Muḥammad Mazīd, for his
part, had control in Samarkand and took all its districts for his
sons and dependants; a small sum only excepted, fixed by them,
not a farthing (<i>fils</i>) from the town reached the Mīrzā by any
channel. Sl. ‘Alī Mīrzā was a grown man; how was he to
tolerate such conduct as theirs? He and some of his household
formed a design against Muḥ. Mazīd Tarkhān; the latter came
to know of it and left the town with all his following and with
whatever begs and other persons were in sympathy with him,<a name="FNanchor_511" id="FNanchor_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">511</a>
such as Sl. Ḥusain <i>Arghūn</i>, Pīr Aḥmad, Aūzūn Ḥasan’s younger
brother, Khwāja Ḥusain, Qarā <i>Barlās</i>, Ṣāliḥ Muḥammad<a name="FNanchor_512" id="FNanchor_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">512</a> and
some other begs and braves.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p><p>At the time The Khān had joined to Khān Mīrzā a number
of Mughūl begs with Muḥ. Ḥusain <i>Dūghlāt</i> and Aḥmad Beg,
and had appointed them to act against Samarkand.<a name="FNanchor_513" id="FNanchor_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">513</a> Khān
Mīrzā’s guardians were Ḥāfiẓ Beg <i>Dūldāī</i> and his son, T̤āhir
Beg; because of relationship to them, (Muḥ. Sīghal’s) grandson,
Ḥasan and Hindū Beg fled with several braves from Sl. ‘Alī
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;77.</span>Mīrzā’s presence to Khān Mīrzā’s.</p>

<p>Muḥammad Mazīd Tarkhān invited Khān Mīrzā and the
Mughūl army, moved to near Shavdār, there saw the Mīrzā
and met the begs of the Mughūls. No small useful friendlinesses
however, came out of the meeting between his begs and
the Mughūls; the latter indeed seem to have thought of making
him a prisoner. Of this he and his begs coming to know,
separated themselves from the Mughūl army. As without him
the Mughūls could make no stand, they retired. Here-upon,
Sl. ‘Alī Mīrzā hurried light out of Samarkand with a few men
and caught them up where they had dismounted in Yār-yīlāq.
They could not even fight but were routed and put to flight.
This deed, done in his last days, was Sl. ‘Alī Mīrzā’s one good
little affair.</p>

<p>Muḥ. Mazīd Tarkhān and his people, despairing both of the
Mughūls and of these Mīrzās, sent Mīr Mughūl, son of ‘Abdu’l-wahhāb
<i>Shaghāwal</i><a name="FNanchor_514" id="FNanchor_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">514</a> to invite me (to Samarkand). Mīr Mughūl
had already been in my service; he had risked his life in good
accord with Khwāja-i-qāẓī during the siege of Andijān (903 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1498
<span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>).</p>

<p>This business hurt us also<a name="FNanchor_515" id="FNanchor_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">515</a> and, as it was for that purpose
we had made peace (with Jahāngīr), we resolved to move on
Samarkand. We sent Mīr Mughūl off at once to give rendezvous<a name="FNanchor_516" id="FNanchor_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">516</a>
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;77b.</span>to Jahāngīr Mīrzā and prepared to get to horse. We rode out
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>in the month of Ẕū’l-qa‘da (June) and with two halts on the
way, came to Qabā and there dismounted.<a name="FNanchor_517" id="FNanchor_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">517</a> At the mid-afternoon
Prayer of that day, news came that Taṃbal’s brother,
Khalīl had taken Aūsh by surprise.</p>

<p>The particulars are as follows;&mdash;As has been mentioned,
Khalīl and those under him were set free when peace was made.
Taṃbal then sent Khalīl to fetch away their wives and families
from Aūzkīnt. He had gone and he went into the fort on this
pretext. He kept saying untruthfully, ‘We will go out today,’
or ‘We will go out tomorrow,’ but he did not go. When we
got to horse, he seized the chance of the emptiness of Aūsh to
go by night and surprise it. For several reasons it was of no
advantage for us to stay and entangle ourselves with him; we
went straight on therefore. One reason was that as, for the
purpose of making ready military equipment, all my men of
name had scattered, heads of houses to their homes, we had no
news of them because we had relied on the peace and were by
this off our guard against the treachery and falsity of the other
party. Another reason was that for some time, as has been<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;78.</span>
said, the misconduct of our great begs, ‘Alī-dost and Qaṃbar-‘alī
had been such that no confidence in them was left. A
further reason was that the Samarkand begs, under Muḥ. Mazīd
Tarkhān had sent Mīr Mughūl to invite us and, so long as a
capital such as Samarkand stood there, what would incline a
man to waste his days for a place like Andijān?</p>

<p>From Qabā we moved on to Marghīnān (20 m.). Marghīnān
had been given to Qūch Beg’s father, Sl. Aḥmad <i>Qarāwal</i>, and
he was then in it. As he, owing to various ties and attachments,
could not attach himself to me,<a name="FNanchor_518" id="FNanchor_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">518</a> he stayed behind while
his son, Qūch Beg and one or two of his brethren, older and
younger, went with me.</p>

<p>Taking the road for Asfara, we dismounted in one of its
villages, called Mahan. That night there came and joined us
in Mahan, by splendid chance, just as if to a rendezvous, Qāsim
Beg <i>Qūchīn</i> with his company, ‘Alī-dost with his, and Sayyid
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>Qāsim with a large body of braves. We rode from Mahan by
the Khasbān (var. Yasān) plain, crossed the Chūpān (Shepherd)-bridge
and so to Aūrā-tīpā.<a name="FNanchor_519" id="FNanchor_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">519</a></p>

<p class="indent">(<i>t. Qaṃbar-‘alī punishes himself.</i>)</p>

<p>Trusting to Taṃbal, Qaṃbar-‘alī went from his own district
(Khujand) to Akhsī in order to discuss army-matters with him.
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;78b.</span>Such an event happening,<a name="FNanchor_520" id="FNanchor_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">520</a> Taṃbal laid hands on Qaṃbar-‘alī,
marched against his district and carried him along. Here the
(Turkī) proverb fits, ‘Distrust your friend! he’ll stuff your hide
with straw.’ While Qaṃbar-‘alī was being made to go to
Khujand, he escaped on foot and after a hundred difficulties
reached Aūrā-tīpā.</p>

<p>News came to us there that Shaibānī Khān had beaten Bāqī
Tarkhān in Dabūsī and was moving on Bukhārā. We went
on from Aūrā-tīpā, by way of Burka-yīlāq, to Sangzār<a name="FNanchor_521" id="FNanchor_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">521</a> which
the sub-governor surrendered. There we placed Qaṃbar-‘alī,
as, after effecting his own capture and betrayal, he had come
to us. We then passed on.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>u. Affairs of Samarkand and the end of ‘Alī-dost.</i>)</p>

<p>On our arrival in Khān-yūrtī, the Samarkand begs under
Muḥ. Mazīd Tarkhān came and did me obeisance. Conference
was held with them as to details for taking the town; they said,
‘Khwāja Yaḥya also is wishing for the <i>pādshāh</i>;<a name="FNanchor_522" id="FNanchor_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">522</a> with his
consent the town may be had easily without fighting or disturbance.’
The Khwāja did not say decidedly to our
messengers that he had resolved to admit us to the town but at
the same time, he said nothing likely to lead us to despair.</p>

<p>Leaving Khān-yūrtī, we moved to the bank of the Dar-i-gham
(canal) and from there sent our librarian, Khwāja Muḥammad
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;79.</span>‘Alī to Khwāja Yaḥya. He brought word back, ‘Let them
come; we will give them the town.’ Accordingly we rode
from the Dar-i-gham straight for the town, at night-fall, but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>our plan came to nothing because Sl. Muḥammad <i>Dūldāī’s</i>
father, Sl. Maḥmūd had fled from our camp and given such
information to (Sl. ‘Alī’s party) as put them on their guard.
Back we went to the Dar-i-gham bank.</p>

<p>While I had been in Yār-yīlāq, one of my favoured begs,
Ibrāhīm <i>Sārū</i> who had been plundered and driven off by ‘Alī-dost,<a name="FNanchor_523" id="FNanchor_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">523</a>
came and did me obeisance, together with Muḥ. Yūsuf,
the elder son of Sayyid Yūsuf (<i>Aūghlāqchī</i>). Coming in by
ones and twos, old family servants and begs and some of the
household gathered back to me there. All were enemies of
‘Alī-dost; some he had driven away; others he had plundered;
others again he had imprisoned. He became afraid. For why?
Because with Taṃbal’s backing, he had harassed and persecuted
me and my well-wishers. As for me, my very nature
sorted ill with the manikin’s! From shame and fear, he could
stay no longer with us; he asked leave; I took it as a personal
favour; I gave it. On this leave, he and his son, Muḥammad-dost
went to Taṃbal’s presence. They became his intimates,<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;79b.</span>
and from father and son alike, much evil and sedition issued.
‘Alī-dost died a few years later from ulceration of the hand.
Muḥammad-dost went amongst the Aūzbegs; that was not
altogether bad but, after some treachery to his salt, he fled
from them and went into the Andijān foot-hills.<a name="FNanchor_524" id="FNanchor_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">524</a> There he
stirred up much revolt and trouble. In the end he fell into the
hands of Aūzbeg people and they blinded him. The meaning
of ‘The salt took his eyes,’ is clear in his case.<a name="FNanchor_525" id="FNanchor_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">525</a></p>

<p>After giving this pair their leave, we sent Ghūrī <i>Barlās</i> toward
Bukhārā for news. He brought word that Shaibānī Khān had
taken Bukhārā and was on his way to Samarkand. Here-upon,
seeing no advantage in staying in that neighbourhood, we set
out for Kesh where, moreover, were the families of most of the
Samarkand begs.</p>

<p>When we had been a few weeks there, news came that Sl.
‘Alī Mīrzā had given Samarkand to Shaibānī Khān. The
particulars are these;&mdash;The Mīrzā’s mother, Zuhra Begī Āghā</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>a. Samarkand in the hands of the Aūzbegs.</i>)</p>

<p>When, acting on that woman’s promise, Shaibānī Khān
went to Samarkand, he dismounted in the Garden of the Plain.
About mid-day Sl. ‘Alī Mīrzā went out to him through the
Four-roads Gate, without a word to any of his begs or unmailed
braves, without taking counsel with any-one soever and
accompanied only by a few men of little consideration from his
own close circle. The Khān, for his part, did not receive him
very favourably; when they had seen one another, he seated
him on his less honourable hand.<a name="FNanchor_528" id="FNanchor_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">528</a> Khwāja Yaḥya, on hearing
of the Mīrzā’s departure, became very anxious but as he could
find no remedy,<a name="FNanchor_529" id="FNanchor_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">529</a> went out also. The Khān looked at him without
rising and said a few words in which blame had part, but
when the Khwāja rose to leave, showed him the respect
of rising.</p>

<p>As soon as Khwāja ‘Alī<a name="FNanchor_530" id="FNanchor_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">530</a> Bāy’s<a name="FNanchor_531" id="FNanchor_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">531</a> son, Jān-‘alī heard in
Rabāt̤-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>i-khwāja of the Mīrzā’s going to Shaibānī Khān, he also went.
As for that calamitous woman who, in her folly, gave her son’s
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;80b.</span>house and possessions to the winds in order to get herself a
husband, Shaibānī Khān cared not one atom for her, indeed
did not regard her as the equal of a mistress or a concubine.<a name="FNanchor_532" id="FNanchor_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">532</a></p>

<p>Confounded by his own act, Sl. ‘Alī Mīrzā’s repentance was
extreme. Some of his close circle, after hearing particulars,
planned for him to escape with them but to this he would
not agree; his hour had come; he was not to be freed. He
had dismounted in Tīmūr Sult̤ān’s quarters; three or four days
later they killed him in Plough-meadow.<a name="FNanchor_533" id="FNanchor_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">533</a> For a matter of this
five-days’ mortal life, he died with a bad name; having entered
into a woman’s affairs, he withdrew himself from the circle of
men of good repute. Of such people’s doings no more should
be written; of acts so shameful, no more should be heard.</p>

<p>The Mīrzā having been killed, Shaibānī Khān sent Jān-‘alī
after his Mīrzā. He had apprehensions also about Khwāja
Yaḥya and therefore dismissed him, with his two sons, Khwāja
Muḥ. Zakarīya and Khwāja Bāqī, towards Khurāsān.<a name="FNanchor_534" id="FNanchor_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">534</a> A few
Aūzbegs followed them and near Khwāja Kārdzan martyred
both the Khwāja and his two young sons. Though Shaibānī’s
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;81.</span>words were, ‘Not through me the Khwāja’s affair! Qaṃbar Bī
and Kūpuk Bī did it,’ this is worse than that! There is a
proverb,<a name="FNanchor_535" id="FNanchor_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">535</a> ‘His excuse is worse than his fault,’ for if begs, out
of their own heads, start such deeds, unknown to their Khāns
or Pādshāhs, what becomes of the authority of khānship and
and sovereignty?</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>b. Bābur leaves Kesh and crosses the Mūra pass.</i>)</p>

<p>Since the Aūzbegs were in possession of Samarkand, we left
Kesh and went in the direction of Ḥiṣār. With us started off
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>Muḥ. Mazīd Tārkhān and the Samarkand begs under his
command, together with their wives and families and people,
but when we dismounted in the Chultū meadow of Chaghānīān,
they parted from us, went to Khusrau Shāh and became his
retainers.</p>

<p>Cut off from our own abiding-town and country,<a name="FNanchor_536" id="FNanchor_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">536</a> not knowing
where (else) to go or where to stay, we were obliged to
traverse the very heart of Khusrau Shāh’s districts, spite of
what measure of misery he had inflicted on the men of our
dynasty!</p>

<p>One of our plans had been to go to my younger Khān dādā,
<i>i.e.</i> Alacha Khān, by way of Qarā-tīgīn and the Alāī,<a name="FNanchor_537" id="FNanchor_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">537</a> but this
was not managed. Next we were for going up the valley of
the Kām torrent and over the Sara-tāq pass (<i>dābān</i>). When
we were near Nūnḍāk, a servant of Khusrau Shāh brought
me one set of nine horses<a name="FNanchor_538" id="FNanchor_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">538</a> and one of nine pieces of cloth.
When we dismounted at the mouth of the Kām valley, Sher-‘alī.<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;81b.</span>

next day, Qūch Beg parted from us and went to Ḥiṣār.<a name="FNanchor_539" id="FNanchor_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">539</a></p>

<p>We entered the valley and made our way up it. On its
steep and narrow roads and at its sharp and precipitous
saddles<a name="FNanchor_540" id="FNanchor_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">540</a> many horses and camels were left. Before we reached
the Sara-tāq pass we had (in 25 m.) to make three or four
night-halts. A pass! and what a pass! Never was such a
steep and narrow pass seen; never were traversed such ravines
and precipices. Those dangerous narrows and sudden falls,
those perilous heights and knife-edge saddles, we got through
with much difficulty and suffering, with countless hardships
and miseries. Amongst the Fān mountains is a large lake
(Iskandar); it is 2 miles in circumference, a beautiful lake and
not devoid of marvels.<a name="FNanchor_541" id="FNanchor_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">541</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>
<p>News came that Ibrāhīm Tarkhān had strengthened Fort
Shīrāz and was seated in it; also that Qaṃbar-‘alī (the Skinner)
and Abū’l-qāsim <i>Kohbur</i>, the latter not being able to stay in
Khwāja Dīdār with the Aūzbegs in Samarkand,&mdash;had both
come into Yār-yīlāq, strengthened its lower forts and occupied
them.</p>

<p>Leaving Fān on our right, we moved on for Keshtūd. The
head-man of Fān had a reputation for hospitality, generosity,
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;82.</span>serviceableness and kindness. He had given tribute of 70 or
80 horses to Sl. Mas‘ūd Mīrzā at the time the Mīrzā, when
Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā made attack on Ḥiṣār, went through Fān on
his way to his younger brother, Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā in Samarkand.
He did like service to others. To me he sent one
second-rate horse; moreover he did not wait on me himself.
So it was! Those renowned for liberality became misers when
they had to do with me, and the politeness of the polite was
forgotten. Khusrau Shāh was celebrated for liberality and
kindness; what service he did Badī‘u’z-zamān Mīrzā has been
mentioned; to Bāqī Tarkhān and other begs he shewed great
generosity also. Twice I happened to pass through his
country;<a name="FNanchor_542" id="FNanchor_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">542</a> not to speak of courtesy shewn to my peers, what he
shewed to my lowest servants he did not shew to me, indeed
he shewed less regard for us than for them.</p>

<p>Under the impression that the Aūzbegs were in Keshtūd, we
made an excursion to it, after passing Fān. Of itself it seemed

went on to the bank of the Kohik-water (Zar-afshān) and there

Yārī and over the Shunqār-khāna (Falcons’-home) range into
Yār-yīlāq. Our begs went to Rabāt̤-i-khwāja and had set up
ladders when the men within came to know about them and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>forced them to retire. As they could not take the fort, they
rejoined us.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>c. Bābur renews attack on Samarkand.</i>)</p>

<p>Qaṃbar-‘alī (the Skinner) was (still) holding Sangzār; he
came and saw us; Abū’l-qāsim <i>Kohbur</i> and Ibrāhīm Tarkhān
showed loyalty and attachment by sending efficient men for
our service. We went into Asfīdik (var. Asfīndik), one of the
Yār-yīlāq villages. At that time Shaibāq Khān lay near
Khwāja Dīdār with 3 or 4000 Aūzbegs and as many more
soldiers gathered in locally. He had given the Government of
Samarkand to Jān-wafā, and Jān-wafā was then in the fort
with 500 or 600 men. Ḥamza Sl. and Mahdī Sl. were lying
near the fort, in the Quail-reserve. Our men, good and bad
were 240.<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;83.</span></p>

<p>Having discussed the position with all my begs and unmailed
braves, we left it at this;&mdash;that as Shaibānī Khān had taken
possession of Samarkand so recently, the Samarkandīs would
not be attached to him nor he to them; that if we made an
effort at once, we might do the thing; that if we set ladders up
and took the fort by surprise, the Samarkandīs would be for
us; how should they not be? even if they gave us no help,
they would not fight us for the Aūzbegs; and that Samarkand
once in our hands, whatever was God’s will, would happen.</p>

<p>Acting on this decision, we rode out of Yār-yīlāq after the
Mid-day Prayer, and on through the dark till mid-night when
we reached Khān-yūrtī. Here we had word that the Samarkandīs
knew of our coming; for this reason we went no nearer
to the town but made straight back from Khān-yūrtī. It was
dawn when, after crossing the Kohik-water below Rabāt̤-i-khwāja,
we were once more in Yār-yīlāq.</p>

<p>One day in Fort Asfīdik a household party was sitting in my
presence; Dost-i-nāṣir and Nuyān<a name="FNanchor_543" id="FNanchor_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">543</a> <i>Kūkūldāsh</i> and Khān-qulī-i-Karīm-dād
and Shaikh Darwesh and Mīrīm-i-nāṣir were all
there. Words were crossing from all sides when (I said),
‘Come now! say when, if God bring it right, we shall take<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;83b.</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>Samarkand.’ Some said, ‘We shall take it in the heats.’ It
was then late in autumn. Others said, ‘In a month,’ ‘Forty
days,’ ‘Twenty days.’ Nuyān <i>Kūkūldāsh</i> said, ‘We shall
take it in 14.’ God shewed him right! we did take it in
exactly 14 days.</p>

<p>Just at that time I had a wonderful dream;&mdash;His Highness
Khwāja ‘Ubaid’l-lāh (<i>Aḥrārī</i>) seemed to come; I seemed to
go out to give him honourable meeting; he came in and seated
himself; people seemed to lay a table-cloth before him,
apparently without sufficient care and, on account of this,
something seemed to come into his Highness Khwāja’s mind.
Mullā Bābā (? <i>Pashāgharī</i>) made me a sign; I signed back,
‘Not through me! the table-layer is in fault!’ The Khwāja
understood and accepted the excuse.<a name="FNanchor_544" id="FNanchor_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">544</a> When he rose, I
escorted him out. In the hall of that house he took hold of
either my right or left arm and lifted me up till one of my feet
was off the ground, saying, in Turkī, ‘Shaikh Maṣlaḥat has
given (Samarkand).’<a name="FNanchor_545" id="FNanchor_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">545</a> I really took Samarkand a few days
later.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>d. Bābur takes Samarkand by surprise.</i>)</p>

<p>In two or three days move was made from Fort Asfīdik to
Fort Wasmand. Although by our first approach, we had let
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;84.</span>our plan be known, we put our trust in God and made another
expedition to Samarkand. It was after the Mid-day Prayer
that we rode out of Fort Wasmand, Khwāja Abū’l-makāram
accompanying us. By mid-night we reached the Deep-fosse-bridge
in the Avenue. From there we sent forward a detachment
of 70 or 80 good men who were to set up ladders opposite
the Lovers’-cave, mount them and get inside, stand up to those
in the Turquoise Gate, get possession of it and send a man
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
to me. Those braves went, set their ladders up opposite the
Lovers’-cave, got in without making anyone aware, went to the
Gate, attacked Fāẓil Tarkhān, chopped at him and his few
retainers, killed them, broke the lock with an axe and opened
the Gate. At that moment I came up and went in.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(<i>Author’s note on Fāẓil Tarkhān.</i>) He was not one of those (Samarkand)
Tarkhāns; he was a merchant-tarkhān of Turkistān. He had
served Shaibānī Khān in Turkistān and had found favour with him.<a name="FNanchor_546" id="FNanchor_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">546</a></p></div>

<p>Abū’l-qāsim <i>Kohbur</i> himself had not come with us but had
sent 30 or 40 of his retainers under his younger brother, Aḥmad-i-qāsim.
No man of Ibrāhīm Tarkhān’s was with us; his
younger brother, Aḥmad Tarkhān came with a few retainers
after I had entered the town and taken post in the Monastery.<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;84b.</span></p>

<p>The towns-people were still slumbering; a few traders
peeped out of their shops, recognized me and put up prayers.
When, a little later, the news spread through the town, there
was rare delight and satisfaction for our men and the towns-folk.
They killed the Aūzbegs in the lanes and gullies with
clubs and stones like mad dogs; four or five hundred were
killed in this fashion. Jān-wafā, the then governor, was living
in Khwāja Yaḥya’s house; he fled and got away to Shaibāq
Khān.<a name="FNanchor_547" id="FNanchor_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">547</a></p>

<p>On entering the Turquoise Gate I went straight to the
College and took post over the arch of the Monastery. There
was a hubbub and shouting of ‘Down! down!’ till day-break.
Some of the notables and traders, hearing what was happening,
came joyfully to see me, bringing what food was ready and
putting up prayers for me. At day-light we had news that the
Aūzbegs were fighting in the Iron Gate where they had made
themselves fast between the (outer and inner) doors. With
10, 15 or 20 men, I at once set off for the Gate but before I
came up, the town-rabble, busy ransacking every corner of the
newly-taken town for loot, had driven the Aūzbegs out through</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;85.</span>it. Shaibāq Khān, on hearing what was happening, hurried at
sun-rise to the Iron Gate with 100 or 140 men. His coming
was a wonderful chance but, as has been said, my men were
very few. Seeing that he could do nothing, he rode off at once.
From the Iron Gate I went to the citadel and there dismounted,
at the Bū-stān palace. Men of rank and consequence and
various head-men came to me there, saw me and invoked
blessings on me.</p>

<p>Samarkand for nearly 140 years had been the capital of
our dynasty. An alien, and of what stamp! an Aūzbeg foe,
had taken possession of it! It had slipped from our hands;
God gave it again! plundered and ravaged, our own returned
to us.</p>

<p>Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā took Harāt<a name="FNanchor_548" id="FNanchor_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">548</a> as we took Samarkand, by
surprise, but to the experienced, and discerning, and just, it
will be clear that between his affair and mine there are distinctions
and differences, and that his capture and mine are
things apart.</p>

<p>Firstly there is this;&mdash;He had ruled many years, passed
through much experience and seen many affairs.</p>

<p>Secondly;&mdash;He had for opponent, Yādgār Muḥ. Nāṣir Mīrzā,
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;85b.</span>an inexperienced boy of 17 or 18.</p>

<p>Thirdly;&mdash;(Yādgār Mīrzā’s) Head-equerry, Mīr ‘Alī, a person
well-acquainted with the particulars of the whole position, sent
a man out from amongst Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā’s opponents to bring
him to surprise them.</p>

<p>Fourthly;&mdash;His opponent was not in the fort but was in the
Ravens’-garden. Moreover Yādgār Muḥ. Nāṣir Mīrzā and his
followers are said to have been so prostrate with drink that
three men only were in the Gate, they also drunk.</p>

<p>Fifthly;&mdash;he surprised and captured Harāt the first time he
approached it.</p>

<p>On the other hand: firstly;&mdash;I was 19 when I took Samarkand.</p>

<p>Secondly;&mdash;I had as my opponent, such a man as Shaibāq
Khān, of mature age and an eye-witness of many affairs.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>
<p>Thirdly;&mdash;No-one came out of Samarkand to me; though
the heart of its people was towards me, no-one could dream of
coming, from dread of Shaibāq Khān.</p>

<p>Fourthly;&mdash;My foe was in the fort; not only was the fort
taken but he was driven off.</p>

<p>Fifthly;&mdash;I had come once already; my opponent was on his
guard about me. The second time we came, God brought it
right! Samarkand was won.</p>

<p>In saying these things there is no desire to be-little the
reputation of any man; the facts were as here stated. In<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;86.</span>
writing these things, there is no desire to magnify myself; the
truth is set down.</p>

<p>The poets composed chronograms on the victory; this one
remains in my memory;&mdash;Wisdom answered, ‘Know that its
date is the <i>Victory</i> (<i>Fatḥ</i>) <i>of Bābur Bahādur</i>.’</p>

<p>Samarkand being taken, Shavdār and Soghd and the <i>tūmāns</i>
and nearer forts began, one after another, to return to us.
From some their Aūzbeg commandants fled in fear and
escaped; from others the inhabitants drove them and came in
to us; in some they made them prisoner, and held the forts
for us.</p>

<p>Just then the wives and families of Shaibāq Khān and his
Aūzbegs arrived from Turkistān;<a name="FNanchor_549" id="FNanchor_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">549</a> he was lying near Khwāja
Dīdār and ‘Alī-ābād but when he saw the forts and people
returning to me, marched off towards Bukhārā. By God’s
grace, all the forts of Soghd and Miyān-kāl returned to me
within three or four months. Over and above this, Bāqī
Tarkhān seized this opportunity to occupy Qarshī; Khuzār
and Qarshī (? Kesh) both went out of Aūzbeg hands; Qarā-kūl<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;86b.</span>
also was taken from them by people of Abū’l-muḥsin Mīrzā
(<i>Bāī-qarā</i>), coming up from Merv. My affairs were in a very
good way.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>e. Birth of Bābur’s first child.</i>)</p>

<p>After our departure (last year) from Andijān, my mothers
and my wife and relations came, with a hundred difficulties and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>hardships, to Aūrātīpā. We now sent for them to Samarkand.
Within a few days after their arrival, a daughter was born to
me by ‘Āyisha-sult̤ān Begīm, my first wife, the daughter of
Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā. They named the child Fakhru’n-nisā’
(Ornament of women); she was my first-born, I was 19. In a
month or 40 days, she went to God’s mercy.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>f. Bābur in Samarkand.</i>)</p>

<p>On taking Samarkand, envoys and summoners were sent off
at once, and sent again and again, with reiterated request for
aid and reinforcement, to the khāns and sult̤āns and begs and
marchers on every side. Some, though experienced men, made
foolish refusal; others whose relations towards our family had
been discourteous and unpleasant, were afraid for themselves
and took no notice; others again, though they sent help, sent
it insufficient. Each such case will be duly mentioned.</p>

<p>When Samarkand was taken the second time, ‘Alī-sher Beg
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;87.</span>was alive. We exchanged letters once; on the back of mine
to him I wrote one of my Turkī couplets. Before his reply
reached me, separations (<i>tafarqa</i>) and disturbances (<i>ghūghā</i>)
had happened.<a name="FNanchor_550" id="FNanchor_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">550</a> Mullā Binā’ī had been taken into Shaibāq
Khān’s service when the latter took possession of Samarkand;
he stayed with him until a few days after I took the place,
when he came into the town to me. Qāsim Beg had his
suspicions about him and consequently dismissed him towards
Shahr-i-sabz but, as he was a man of parts, and as no fault of
his came to light, I had him fetched back. He constantly
presented me with odes (<i>qaṣīda u ghazal</i>). He brought me a
song in the Nawā mode composed to my name and at the
same time the following quatrain;&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_551" id="FNanchor_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">551</a></p>

<p>Though this winter our affairs were in a very good way and
Shaibāq Khān’s were on the wane, one or two occurrences were
somewhat of a disservice; (1) the Merv men who had taken
Qarā-kūl, could not be persuaded to stay there and it went
back into the hands of the Aūzbegs; (2) Shaibāq Khān besieged
Ibrāhīm Tarkhān’s younger brother, Aḥmad in Dabūsī, stormed
the place and made a general massacre of its inhabitants before
the army we were collecting was ready to march.</p>

<p>With 240 proved men I had taken Samarkand; in the next<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;88.</span>
five or six months, things so fell out by the favour of the Most
High God, that, as will be told, we fought the arrayed battle of
Sar-i-pul with a man like Shaibāq Khān. The help those
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>round-about gave us was as follows;&mdash;From The Khān had
come, with 4 or 5000 Bārīns, Ayūb <i>Begchīk</i> and Qashka
Maḥmūd; from Jahāngīr Mīrzā had come Khalīl, Taṃbal’s
younger brother, with 100 or 200 men; not a man had come
from Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā, that experienced ruler, than whom
none knew better the deeds and dealings of Shaibāq Khān; none
came from Badī‘u’z-zamān Mīrzā; none from Khusrau Shāh
because he, the author of what evil done,&mdash;as has been told,&mdash;to
our dynasty! feared us more than he feared Shaibāq Khān.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>g. Bābur defeated at Sar-i-pul.</i>)</p>

<p>I marched out of Samarkand, with the wish of fighting
Shaibāq Khān, in the month of Shawwāl<a name="FNanchor_553" id="FNanchor_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">553</a> and went to the
New-garden where we lay four or five days for the convenience
of gathering our men and completing our equipment. We
took the precaution of fortifying our camp with ditch and
branch. From the New-garden we advanced, march by march,
to beyond Sar-i-pul (Bridge-head) and there dismounted.
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;88b.</span>Shaibāq Khān came from the opposite direction and dismounted
at Khwāja Kārdzan, perhaps one <i>yīghāch</i> away
(? 5 m.). We lay there for four or five days. Every day our
people went from our side and his came from theirs and fell on
one another. One day when they were in unusual force, there
was much fighting but neither side had the advantage. Out of
that engagement one of our men went rather hastily back into
the entrenchments; he was using a standard; some said it
was Sayyidī Qarā Beg’s standard who really was a man of
strong words but weak sword. Shaibāq Khān made one
night-attack on us but could do nothing because the camp was
protected by ditch and close-set branches. His men raised
their war-cry, rained in arrows from outside the ditch and then
retired.</p>

<p>In the work for the coming battle I exerted myself greatly
and took all precautions; Qaṃbar-‘alī also did much. In
Kesh lay Bāqī Tarkhān with 1000 to 2000 men, in a position
to join us after a couple of days. In Diyūl, 4 <i>yīghāch</i> off
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>(? 20 m.), lay Sayyid Muḥ. Mīrzā <i>Dūghlāt</i>, bringing me 1000 to
2000 men from my Khān dādā; he would have joined me at<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;89.</span>
dawn. With matters in this position, we hurried on the fight!</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>The reason I was so eager to engage was that on the day of
battle, the Eight stars<a name="FNanchor_555" id="FNanchor_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">555</a> were between the two armies; they
would have been in the enemy’s rear for 13 or 14 days if the
fight had been deferred. I now understand that these considerations
are worth nothing and that our haste was without reason.</p>

<p>As we wished to fight, we marched from our camp at dawn,
we in our mail, our horses in theirs, formed up in array of right
and left, centre and van. Our right was Ibrāhīm <i>Sārū</i>, Ibrāhīm
Jānī, Abū’l-qāsim <i>Kohbur</i> and other begs. Our left was Muḥ.
Mazīd Tarkhān, Ibrāhīm Tarkhān and other Samarkandī begs,
also Sl. Ḥusain <i>Arghūn</i>, Qarā (Black) <i>Barlās</i>, Pīr Aḥmad and
Khwāja Ḥusain. Qāsim Beg was (with me) in the centre and
also several of my close circle and household. In the van were
inscribed Qaṃbar-‘alī the Skinner, Banda-‘alī, Khwāja ‘Alī,
Mīr Shāh <i>Qūchīn</i>, Sayyid Qāsim, Lord of the Gate,&mdash;Banda-‘alī’s
younger brother Khaldar (mole-marked) and Ḥaidar-i-qāsim’s
son Qūch, together with all the good braves there
were, and the rest of the household.</p>

<p>Thus arrayed, we marched from our camp; the enemy, also
in array, marched out from his. His right was Maḥmūd and
Jānī and Tīmūr Sult̤āns; his left, Ḥamza and Mahdī and some<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;89b.</span>
other sult̤āns. When our two armies approached one another,
he wheeled his right towards our rear. To meet this, I
turned; this left our van,&mdash;in which had been inscribed what
not of our best braves and tried swordsmen!&mdash;to our right and
bared our front (<i>i.e.</i> the front of the centre). None-the-less we
fought those who made the front-attack on us, turned them
and forced them back on their own centre. So far did we
carry it that some of Shaibāq Khān’s old chiefs said to him,
‘We must move off! It is past a stand.’ He however held
fast. His right beat our left, then wheeled (again) to our rear.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p><p>(As has been said), the front of our centre was bare through
our van’s being left to the right. The enemy attacked us front
and rear, raining in arrows on us. (Ayūb <i>Begchīk’s</i>) Mughūl
army, come for our help! was of no use in fighting; it set to
work forthwith to unhorse and plunder our men. Not this
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;90.</span>once only! This is always the way with those ill-omened
Mughūls! If they win, they grab at booty; if they lose, they
unhorse and pilfer their own side! We drove back the
Aūzbegs who attacked our front by several vigorous assaults,
but those who had wheeled to our rear came up and rained
arrows on our standard. Falling on us in this way, from the
front and from the rear, they made our men hurry off.</p>

<p>This same turning-movement is one of the great merits of
Aūzbeg fighting; no battle of theirs is ever without it. Another
merit of theirs is that they all, begs and retainers, from their
front to their rear, ride, loose-rein at the gallop, shouting as they
come and, in retiring, do not scatter but ride off, at the gallop,
in a body.</p>

<p>Ten or fifteen men were left with me. The Kohik-water
was close by,&mdash;the point of our right had rested on it. We
made straight for it. It was the season when it comes down in
flood. We rode right into it, man and horse in mail. It was
just fordable for half-way over; after that it had to be swum.
For more than an arrow’s flight<a name="FNanchor_556" id="FNanchor_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">556</a> we, man and mount in mail!
made our horses swim and so got across. Once out of the
water, we cut off the horse-armour and let it lie. By thus
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;90b.</span>passing to the north bank of the river, we were free of our foes,
but at once Mughūl wretches were the captors and pillagers of
one after another of my friends. Ibrāhīm Tarkhān and some
others, excellent braves all, were unhorsed and killed by
Mughūls.<a name="FNanchor_557" id="FNanchor_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">557</a> We moved along the north bank of the Kohik-river,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>recrossed it near Qulba, entered the town by the Shaikh-zāda’s
Gate and reached the citadel in the middle of the afternoon.</p>

<p>Begs of our greatest, braves of our best and many men
perished in that fight. There died Ibrāhīm Tarkhān, Ibrāhīm
<i>Sārū</i> and Ibrāhīm Jānī; oddly enough three great begs named
Ibrāhīm perished. There died also Ḥaidar-i-qāsim’s eldest
son, Abū’l-qāsim <i>Kohbur</i>, and Khudāī-bīrdī <i>Tūghchī</i> and Khalīl,
Taṃbal’s younger brother, spoken of already several times.
Many of our men fled in different directions; Muḥ. Mazīd
Tarkhān went towards Qūndūz and Ḥiṣār for Khusrau Shāh.<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;91.</span>
Some of the household and of the braves, such as Karīm-dad-i-Khudāī-bīrdī
<i>Turkmān</i> and Jānaka <i>Kūkūldāsh</i> and Mullā Bābā
of Pashāghar got away to Aūrā-tīpā. Mullā Bābā at that time
was not in my service but had gone out with me in a guest’s
fashion. Others again, did what Sherīm T̤aghāī and his band
did;&mdash;though he had come back with me into the town and
though when consultation was had, he had agreed with the
rest to make the fort fast, looking for life or death within it,
yet spite of this, and although my mothers and sisters, elder
and younger, stayed on in Samarkand, he sent off their wives
and families to Aūrā-tīpā and remained himself with just a few
men, all unencumbered. Not this once only! Whenever hard
work had to be done, low and double-minded action was the
thing to expect from him!</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>h. Bābur besieged in Samarkand.</i>)</p>

<p>Next day, I summoned Khwāja Abū’l-makāram, Qāsim and
the other begs, the household and such of the braves as were
admitted to our counsels, when after consultation, we resolved
to make the fort fast and to look for life or death within it.
I and Qāsim Beg with my close circle and household were the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>reserve. For convenience in this I took up quarters in the
middle of the town, in tents pitched on the roof of Aūlūgh Beg
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;91b.</span>Mīrzā’s College. To other begs and braves posts were assigned
in the Gates or on the ramparts of the walled-town.</p>

<p>Two or three days later, Shaibāq Khān dismounted at some
distance from the fort. On this, the town-rabble came out of
lanes and wards, in crowds, to the College gate, shouted good
wishes for me and went out to fight in mob-fashion. Shaibāq
Khān had got to horse but could not so much as approach the
town. Several days went by in this fashion. The mob and
rabble, knowing nothing of sword and arrow-wounds, never
witnesses of the press and carnage of a stricken field, through
these incidents, became bold and began to sally further and
further out. If warned by the braves against going out so
incautiously, they broke into reproach.</p>

<p>One day when Shaibāq Khān had directed his attack towards
the Iron Gate, the mob, grown bold, went out, as usual,
daringly and far. To cover their retreat, we sent several braves
towards the Camel’s-neck,<a name="FNanchor_558" id="FNanchor_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">558</a> foster-brethren and some of the
close household-circle, such as Nuyān <i>Kūkūldāsh</i>, Qul-naz̤ar
(son of Sherīm?) T̤aghāī Beg, and Mazīd. An Aūzbeg or two
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;92.</span>put their horses at them and with Qul-naz̤ar swords were
crossed. The rest of the Aūzbegs dismounted and brought
their strength to bear on the rabble, hustled them off and
rammed them in through the Iron Gate. Qūch Beg and Mīr
Shāh <i>Qūchīn</i> had dismounted at the side of Khwāja Khiẓr’s
Mosque and were making a stand there. While the townsmen
were being moved off by those on foot, a party of mounted
Aūzbegs rode towards the Mosque. Qūch Beg came out when
they drew near and exchanged good blows with them. He did
distinguished work; all stood to watch. Our fugitives below
were occupied only with their own escape; for them the time
to shoot arrows and make a stand had gone by. I was shooting
with a slur-bow<a name="FNanchor_559" id="FNanchor_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">559</a> from above the Gate and some of my circle
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>were shooting arrows (<i>aūq</i>). Our attack from above kept the
enemy from advancing beyond the Mosque; from there he
retired.</p>

<p>During the siege, the round of the ramparts was made each
night; sometimes I went, sometimes Qāsim Beg, sometimes
one of the household Begs. Though from the Turquoise to the
Shaikh-zāda’s Gate may be ridden, the rest of the way must be<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;92b.</span>
walked. When some men went the whole round on foot, it
was dawn before they had finished.<a name="FNanchor_560" id="FNanchor_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">560</a></p>

<p>One day Shaibāq Khān attacked between the Iron Gate and
the Shaikh-zāda’s. I, as the reserve, went to the spot, without
anxiety about the Bleaching-ground and Needle-makers’ Gates.
That day, (?) in a shooting wager (<i>aūq aūchīdā</i>), I made a good
shot with a slur-bow, at a Centurion’s horse.<a name="FNanchor_561" id="FNanchor_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">561</a> It died at once
(<i>aūq bārdī</i>) with the arrow (<i>aūq bīla</i>). They made such a
vigorous attack this time that they got close under the
ramparts. Busy with the fighting and the stress near the
Iron Gate, we were entirely off our guard about the other side
of the town. There, opposite the space between the Needle-makers’
and Bleaching-ground Gates, the enemy had posted
7 or 800 good men in ambush, having with them 24 or 25
ladders so wide that two or three could mount abreast. These
men came from their ambush when the attack near the Iron
Gate, by occupying all our men, had left those other posts
empty, and quickly set up their ladders between the two Gates,<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;93.</span>
just where a road leads from the ramparts to Muḥ. Mazīd
Tarkhān’s houses. That post was Qūch Beg’s and Muḥammad-qulī
<i>Qūchīn’s</i>, with their detachment of braves, and they had
their quarters in Muḥ. Mazīd’s houses. In the Needle-makers’
Gate was posted Qarā (Black) <i>Barlās</i>, in the Bleaching-ground
Gate, Qūtlūq Khwāja <i>Kūkūldāsh</i> with Sherīm T̤aghāī and his
brethren, older and younger. As attack was being made on
the other side of the town, the men attached to these posts
were not on guard but had scattered to their quarters or to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>bazar for necessary matters of service and servants’ work.
Only the begs were at their posts, with one or two of the
populace. Qūch Beg and Mūhammad-qulī and Shāh Ṣufī and
one other brave did very well and boldly. Some Aūzbegs were
on the ramparts, some were coming up, when these four men
arrived at a run, dealt them blow upon blow, and, by energetic
drubbing, forced them all down and put them to flight. Qūch
Beg did best; this was his out-standing and approved good
deed; twice during this siege he got his hand into the work.
Qarā <i>Barlās</i> had been left alone in the Needle-makers’ Gate;
he also held out well to the end. Qūtlūq Khwāja and Qul-naz̤ar
Mīrzā were also at their posts in the Bleaching-ground
Gate; they held out well too, and charged the foe in his rear.</p>

<p>Another time Qāsim Beg led his braves out through the
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;93b.</span>Needle-makers’ Gate, pursued the Aūzbegs as far as Khwāja
Kafsher, unhorsed some and returned with a few heads.</p>

<p>It was now the time of ripening rain but no-one brought
new corn into the town. The long siege caused great privation
to the towns-people;<a name="FNanchor_562" id="FNanchor_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">562</a> it went so far that the poor and destitute
began to eat the flesh of dogs and asses and, as there was little
grain for the horses, people fed them on leaves. Experience
shewed that the leaves best suiting were those of the mulberry
and elm (<i>qarā-yīghāch</i>). Some people scraped dry wood and
gave the shavings, damped, to their horses.</p>

<p>For three or four months Shaibāq Khān did not come near
the fort but had it invested at some distance and himself moved
round it from post to post. Once when our men were off their
guard, at mid-night, the enemy came near to the Turquoise
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;94.</span>Gate, beat his drums and flung his war-cry out. I was in the
College, undressed. There was great trepidation and anxiety.
After that they came night after night, disturbing us by drumming
and shouting their war-cry.</p>

<p>Although envoys and messengers had been sent repeatedly
to all sides and quarters, no help and reinforcement arrived
from any-one. No-one had helped or reinforced me when I
was in strength and power and had suffered no sort of defeat
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>or loss; on what score would any-one help me now? No hope
in any-one whatever recommended us to prolong the siege.
The old saying was that to hold a fort there must be a head,
two hands and two legs, that is to say, the Commandant is the
head; help and reinforcement coming from two quarters are
the two arms and the food and water in the fort are the two
legs. While we looked for help from those round about, their
thoughts were elsewhere. That brave and experienced ruler,
Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā, gave us not even the help of an encouraging
message, but none-the-less he sent Kamālu’d-dīn Ḥusain <i>Gāzur-gāhī</i><a name="FNanchor_563" id="FNanchor_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">563</a>

Lak-lakān and the Tūrāk Four-gardens but separated without
engaging. Sl. Maḥmūd was not a fighting man; now when

deed. Aḥmad Beg was unpolished<a name="FNanchor_566" id="FNanchor_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">566</a> but brave and well-meaning.

<p>The siege drew on to great length; no provisions and supplies
came in from any quarter, no succour and reinforcement from
any side. The soldiers and peasantry became hopeless and, by
ones and twos, began to let themselves down outside<a name="FNanchor_568" id="FNanchor_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">568</a> the walls
and flee. On Shaibāq Khān’s hearing of the distress in the

turn, went to Malik-muḥammad Mīrzā’s dwellings in Low-lane,
over against him. On one of those days, Khwāja Ḥusain’s
brother, Aūzūn Ḥasan<a name="FNanchor_569" id="FNanchor_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">569</a> came into the town with 10 or 15 of his
men,&mdash;he who, as has been told, had been the cause of Jahāngīr
Mīrzā’s rebellion, of my exodus from Samarkand (903 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>&mdash;March

<p>The soldiery and townspeople became more and more distressed.
Trusted men of my close circle began to let themselves
down from the ramparts and get away; begs of known
name and old family servants were amongst them, such as Pīr
Wais, Shaikh Wais and Wais <i>Lāgharī</i>.<a name="FNanchor_571" id="FNanchor_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">571</a> Of help from any side

hundred difficulties, we got past Khwāja Dīdār. At the Sunnat
Prayer we scrambled up the rising-ground of Qarā-būgh.<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;95b.</span>
From the north slope of Qarā-būgh we hurried on past the foot
of Judūk village and dropped down into Yīlān-aūtī. On the
road I raced with Qāsim Beg and Qaṃbar-‘alī (the Skinner);
my horse was leading when I, thinking to look at theirs behind,
twisted myself round; the girth may have slackened, for my
saddle turned and I was thrown on my head to the ground.
Although I at once got up and remounted, my brain did not
steady till the evening; till then this world and what went on
appeared to me like things felt and seen in a dream or fancy.
Towards afternoon we dismounted in Yīlān-aūtī, there killed a

rode on. Very weary, we reached Khalīla-village before the
dawn and dismounted. From there it was gone on to Dīzak.</p>

<p>In Dīzak just then was Ḥāfiẓ Muḥ. <i>Dūldāī’s</i> son, T̤āhir.

Khānīm. The separation had lasted 13 or 14 years. To see
these relations she now started for Tāshkīnt.</p>

<p>After consulting with Muḥ. Ḥusain Mīrzā, it was settled for
us to winter in a place called Dikh-kat<a name="FNanchor_582" id="FNanchor_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">582</a> one of the Aūrā-tīpā
villages. There I deposited my impedimenta (<i>aūrūq</i>); then set
out myself in order to visit Shāh Begīm and my Khān dādā
and various relatives. I spent a few days in Tāshkīnt and
waited on Shāh Begīm and my Khān dādā. My mother’s
elder full-sister, Mihr-nigār Khānīm<a name="FNanchor_583" id="FNanchor_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">583</a> had come from Samarkand
and was in Tāshkīnt. There my mother Khānīm fell very
ill; it was a very bad illness; she passed through mighty risks.</p>

<p>His Highness Khwājaka Khwāja, having managed to get
out of Samarkand, had settled down in Far-kat; there I visited
him. I had hoped my Khān dādā would shew me affection
and kindness and would give me a country or a district
(<i>pargana</i>). He did promise me Aūrā-tīpā but Muḥ. Ḥusain
Mīrzā. did not make it over, whether acting on his own account<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;97.</span>
or whether upon a hint from above, is not known. After
spending a few days with him (in Aūrā-tīpā), I went on to
Dikh-kat.</p>

<p>Dikh-kat is in the Aūrā-tīpā hill-tracts, below the range on
the other side of which is the Macha<a name="FNanchor_584" id="FNanchor_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">584</a> country. Its people,
though Sārt, settled in a village, are, like Turks, herdsmen and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>shepherds. Their sheep are reckoned at 40,000. We dismounted
at the houses of the peasants in the village; I stayed
in a head-man’s house. He was old, 70 or 80, but his mother
was still alive. She was a woman on whom much life had been
bestowed for she was 111 years old. Some relation of hers
may have gone, (as was said), with Tīmūr Beg’s army to
Hindūstān;<a name="FNanchor_585" id="FNanchor_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">585</a> she had this in her mind and used to tell the tale.
In Dikh-kat alone were 96 of her descendants, hers and her
grandchildren, great-grandchildren and grandchildren’s grandchildren.
Counting in the dead, 200 of her descendants were
reckoned up. Her grandchild’s grandson was a strong young
man of 25 or 26, with full black beard. While in Dikh-kat, I
constantly made excursions amongst the mountains round
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;97b.</span>about. Generally I went bare-foot and, from doing this so
much, my feet became so that rock and stone made no
difference to them.<a name="FNanchor_586" id="FNanchor_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">586</a> Once in one of these wanderings, a cow
was seen, between the Afternoon and Evening prayers, going
down by a narrow, ill-defined road. Said I, ‘I wonder which
way that road will be going; keep your eye on that cow; don’t
lose the cow till you know where the road comes out.’ Khwāja
Asadu’l-lāh made his joke, ‘If the cow loses her way,’ he said,
‘what becomes of us?’</p>

<p>In the winter several of our soldiers asked for leave to
Andijān because they could make no raids with us.<a name="FNanchor_587" id="FNanchor_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">587</a> Qāsim
Beg said, with much insistance, ‘As these men are going, send
something special of your own wear by them to Jahāngīr
Mīrzā.’ I sent my ermine cap. Again he urged, ‘What harm
would there be if you sent something for Taṃbal also?’
Though I was very unwilling, yet as he urged it, I sent Taṃbal
a large broad-sword which Nuyān <i>Kūkūldāsh</i> had had made for
himself in Samarkand. This very sword it was which, as will

news of this, we gallopped off, not regarding the smallness

bitter,<a name="FNanchor_589" id="FNanchor_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">589</a> a wind not less than the Hā-darwesh<a name="FNanchor_590" id="FNanchor_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">590</a> raging violently
the whole time. So cold it was that during the two or three
days we were in those parts, several men died of it. When,
needing to make ablution, I went into an irrigation-channel,
frozen along both banks but because of its swift current, not
ice-bound in the middle, and bathed, dipping under 16 times,
the cold of the water went quite through me. Next day we
crossed the river on the ice from opposite Khaṣlār and went on
through the dark to Bīsh-kīnt.<a name="FNanchor_591" id="FNanchor_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">591</a> Shaibāq Khān, however, must

and dissipated person, had come to my presence in Samarkand
and had received all kindness from me. This sodomite, Mūmin,

Ḥaidar’s son, Mūmin invited Nuyān <i>Kūkūldāsh</i> and Aḥmad-i-qāsim
and some others in order to return them hospitality
received in Samarkand. When I left Bīsh-kīnt, therefore they
stayed behind. Mūmin’s entertainment to this party was given
on the edge of a ravine (<i>jar</i>). Next day news was brought to
us in Sām-sīrak, a village in the Blacksmith’s-dale, that Nuyān
was dead through falling when drunk into the ravine. We
sent his own mother’s brother, Ḥaq-naz̤ar and others, who
searched out where he had fallen. They committed Nuyān to
the earth in Bīsh-kīnt, and came back to me. They had found
the body at the bottom of the ravine an arrow’s flight from the
place of the entertainment. Some suspected that Mūmin,
nursing his trumpery rancour, had taken Nuyān’s life. None
knew the truth. His death made me strangely sad; for few
men have I felt such grief; I wept unceasingly for a week or

that, gathered together close at hand, we might miss no chance

we went back to Macha.</p>

<p>It passed through my mind that to wander from mountain to
mountain, homeless and houseless, without country or abiding-place,
had nothing to recommend it. ‘Go you right off to The
Khān,’ I said to myself. Qāsim Beg was not willing for this
move, apparently being uneasy because, as has been told, he
had put Mughūls to death at Qarā-būlāq, by way of example.
However much we urged it, it was not to be! He drew off for
Ḥiṣār with all his brothers and his whole following. We for
our part, crossed the Āb-burdan pass and set forward for The
Khān’s presence in Tāshkīnt.</p>

some doubt about it, because at that time I had not studied
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;100.</span>poetic idiom so much as I have now done. The Khān was
good-natured and also he wrote verses, though ones somewhat
deficient in the requisites for odes. I presented my quatrain
and I laid my doubts before him but got no reply so clear as to
remove them. His study of poetic idiom appeared to have

<p class="indent">(<i>g. The acclaiming of the standards.</i>)</p>

<p>When, a few days later, The Khān heard that Taṃbal had
gone up into Aūrā-tīpā, he got his army to horse and rode out
from Tāshkīnt. Between Bīsh-kīnt and Sām-sīrak he formed
up into array of right and left and saw the count<a name="FNanchor_602" id="FNanchor_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">602</a> of his men.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>This done, the standards were acclaimed in Mughūl fashion.<a name="FNanchor_603" id="FNanchor_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">603</a>
The Khān dismounted and nine standards were set up in front
of him. A Mughūl tied a long strip of white cloth to the thigh-bone
(<i>aūrta aīlīk</i>) of a cow and took the other end in his hand.
Three other long strips of white cloth were tied to the staves of
three of the (nine) standards, just below the yak-tails, and their
other ends were brought for The Khān to stand on one and for
me and Sl. Muḥ. Khānika to stand each on one of the two
others. The Mughūl who had hold of the strip of cloth<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;100b.</span>
fastened to the cow’s leg, then said something in Mughūl while
he looked at the standards and made signs towards them. The
Khān and those present sprinkled <i>qumīz</i><a name="FNanchor_604" id="FNanchor_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">604</a> in the direction of
the standards; hautbois and drums were sounded towards
them;<a name="FNanchor_605" id="FNanchor_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">605</a> the army flung the war-cry out three times towards
them, mounted, cried it again and rode at the gallop round
them.</p>

<p>Precisely as Chīngīz Khān laid down his rules, so the
Mughūls still observe them. Each man has his place, just
where his ancestors had it; right, right,&mdash;left, left,&mdash;centre,
centre. The most reliable men go to the extreme points of the
right and left. The Chīrās and Begchīk clans always demand
to go to the point in the right.<a name="FNanchor_606" id="FNanchor_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">606</a> At that time the Beg of the
Chīrās tūmān was a very bold brave, Qāshka (Mole-marked)
Maḥmud and the beg of the renowned Begchīk tūmān was
Ayūb <i>Begchīk</i>. These two, disputing which should go out to
the point, drew swords on one another. At last it seems to
have been settled that one should take the highest place in the
hunting-circle, the other, in the battle-array.</p>

<p>Next day after making the circle, it was hunted near Sāmsīrak;

</div></div></div>

<p>There were six couplets; every ode I finished later was
written just on this plan.</p>

<p>The Khān moved, march by march, from Sām-sīrak to the
bank of the Khujand-river. One day we crossed the water by
way of an excursion, cooked food and made merry with the
braves and pages. That day some-one stole the gold clasp of
my girdle. Next day Bayān-qulī’s Khān-qulī and Sl. Muḥ.
Wais fled to Taṃbal. Every-one suspected them of that bad
deed. Though this was not ascertained, Aḥmad-i-qāsim <i>Kohbur</i>
asked leave and went away to Aūrā-tīpā. From that leave he
did not return; he too went to Taṃbal.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>a. Bābur’s poverty in Tāshkīnt.</i>)</p>

<p>This move of The Khān’s was rather unprofitable; to take
no fort, to beat no foe, he went out and went back.</p>

<p>During my stay in Tāshkīnt, I endured much poverty and
humiliation. No country or hope of one! Most of my retainers
dispersed, those left, unable to move about with me
because of their destitution! If I went to my Khān dādā’s
Gate,<a name="FNanchor_608" id="FNanchor_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">608</a> I went sometimes with one man, sometimes with two.

After showing myself<a name="FNanchor_609" id="FNanchor_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">609</a> in his presence, I used to go to Shāh
Begīm’s, entering her house, bareheaded and barefoot, just
as if it were my own.</p>

<p>This uncertainty and want of house and home drove me
at last to despair. Said I, ‘It would be better to take my head<a name="FNanchor_610" id="FNanchor_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">610</a>
and go off than live in such misery; better to go as far as my
feet can carry me than be seen of men in such poverty and
humiliation.’ Having settled on China to go to, I resolved
to take my head and get away. From my childhood up I
had wished to visit China but had not been able to manage
it because of ruling and attachments. Now sovereignty itself
was gone! and my mother, for her part, was re-united to her
(step)-mother and her younger brother. The hindrances to my
journey had been removed; my anxiety for my mother was
dispelled. I represented (to Shāh Begīm and The Khān)
through Khwāja Abū’l-makāram that now such a foe as

bring about the meeting between him and them?</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;102.</span>Under this pretext I proposed to get out of those surroundings;<a name="FNanchor_614" id="FNanchor_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">614</a>
once in Mughūlistān and Turfān, my reins would be in
my own hands, without check or anxiety. I put no-one in
possession of my scheme. Why not? Because it was impossible
for me to mention such a scheme to my mother, and
also because it was with other expectations that the few of
all ranks who had been my companions in exile and privation,
had cut themselves off with me and with me suffered change of
fortune. To speak to them also of such a scheme would be no
pleasure.</p>

<p>The Khwāja, having laid my plan before Shāh Begīm and
The Khān, understood them to consent to it but, later, it
occurred to them that I might be asking leave a second time,<a name="FNanchor_615" id="FNanchor_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">615</a>
because of not receiving kindness. That touching their reputation,
they delayed a little to give the leave.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>b. The Younger Khān comes to Tāshkīnt.</i>)</p>

<p>At this crisis a man came from the Younger Khān to say
that he was actually on his way. This brought my scheme to

we all went out to give him honourable meeting, Shāh Begīm
and his younger sisters, Sult̤ān-nigār Khānīm and Daulat-sult̤ān
Khānīm, and I and Sl. Muḥ. Khānika and Khān
Mīrzā (Wais).</p>

<p>Between Tāshkīnt and Sairām is a village called Yagha
(var. Yaghma), with some smaller ones, where are the tombs
of Father Abraham and Father Isaac. So far we went out.
Knowing nothing exact about his coming,<a name="FNanchor_616" id="FNanchor_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">616</a> I rode out for an<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;102b.</span>
excursion, with an easy mind. All at once, he descended on
me, face to face. I went forward; when I stopped, he stopped.
He was a good deal perturbed; perhaps he was thinking of
dismounting in some fixed spot and there seated, of receiving
me ceremoniously. There was no time for this; when we were
near each other, I dismounted. He had not time even to
dismount;<a name="FNanchor_617" id="FNanchor_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">617</a> I bent the knee, went forward and saw him.
Hurriedly and with agitation, he told Sl. Sa‘īd Khān and Bābā
Khān Sl. to dismount, bend the knee with (<i>bīla</i>) me and make
my acquaintance.<a name="FNanchor_618" id="FNanchor_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">618</a> Just these two of his sons had come with
him; they may have been 13 or 14 years old. When I had
seen them, we all mounted and went to Shāh Begīm’s presence.
After he had seen her and his sisters, and had renewed acquaintance,
they all sat down and for half the night told
one another particulars of their past and gone affairs.</p>

<p>Next day, my Younger Khān dādā bestowed on me arms
of his own and one of his own special horses saddled, and a
Mughūl head-to-foot dress,&mdash;a Mughūl cap,<a name="FNanchor_619" id="FNanchor_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">619</a> a long coat of
Chinese satin, with broidering of stitchery,<a name="FNanchor_620" id="FNanchor_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">620</a> and Chinese
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>armour; in the old fashion, they had hung, on the left side, a
haversack (<i>chantāī</i>) and an outer bag,<a name="FNanchor_621" id="FNanchor_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">621</a> and three or four things
such as women usually hang on their collars, perfume-holders
and various receptacles;<a name="FNanchor_622" id="FNanchor_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">622</a> in the same way, three or four things
hung on the right side also.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;103.</span>From there we went to Tāshkīnt. My Elder Khān dādā
also had come out for the meeting, some 3 or 4 <i>yīghāch</i> (12 to
15 m.) along the road. He had had an awning set up in
a chosen spot and was seated there. The Younger Khān went
up directly in front of him; on getting near, fetched a circle,
from right to left, round him; then dismounted before him.
After advancing to the place of interview (<i>kūrūshūr yīr</i>), he nine
times bent the knee; that done, went close and saw (his
brother). The Elder Khān, in his turn, had risen when the
Younger Khān drew near. They looked long at one another
(<i>kūrūshtīlār</i>) and long stood in close embrace (<i>qūchūshūb</i>). The
Younger Khān again bent the knee nine times when retiring,
many times also on offering his gift; after that, he went and sat
down.</p>

<p>All his men had adorned themselves in Mughūl fashion.
There they were in Mughūl caps (<i>būrk</i>); long coats of Chinese
satin, broidered with stitchery, Mughūl quivers and saddles of
green shagreen-leather, and Mughūl horses adorned in a unique
fashion. He had brought rather few men, over 1000 and under
2000 may-be. He was a man of singular manners, a mighty
master of the sword, and brave. Amongst arms he preferred
to trust to the sword. He used to say that of arms there are,
the <i>shash-par</i><a name="FNanchor_623" id="FNanchor_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">623</a> (six-flanged mace), the <i>piyāzī</i> (rugged mace), the

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>all, if they strike, work only with what of them first touches,
but the sword, if it touch, works from point to hilt. He
never parted with his keen-edged sword; it was either at his
waist or to his hand. He was a little rustic and rough-of-speech,<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;103b.</span>
through having grown up in an out-of-the-way place.</p>

<p>When, adorned in the way described, I went with him to
The Khān, Khwāja Abū’l-makāram asked, ‘Who is this
honoured sult̤ān?’ and till I spoke, did not recognize me.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>c. The Khāns march into Farghāna against Taṃbal.</i>)</p>

<p>Leaving The Khāns in Karnān, we crossed the river on rafts
near Sakan, traversed the Khūqān sub-district (<i>aūrchīn</i>), crushed<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;104.</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>Qabā and by way of the Alāī sub-districts<a name="FNanchor_628" id="FNanchor_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">628</a> descended suddenly
on Aūsh. We reached it at dawn, unexpected; those in it
could but surrender. Naturally the country-folk were wishing
much for us, but they had not been able to find their means,
both through dread of Taṃbal and through our remoteness.
After we entered Aūsh, the hordes and the highland and lowland
tribes of southern and eastern Andijān came in to us.
The Aūzkīnt people also, willing to serve us, sent me a man
and came in.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(<i>Author’s note on Aūzkīnt.</i>) Aūzkīnt formerly must have been a
capital of Farghāna;<a name="FNanchor_629" id="FNanchor_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">629</a> it has an excellent fort and is situated on the
boundary (of Farghāna).</p></div>

<p>The Marghīnānīs also came in after two or three days,
having beaten and chased their commandant (<i>darogha</i>). Except
Andijān, every fort south of the Khujand-water had now come
in to us. Spite of the return in those days of so many forts,
and spite of risings and revolt against him, Taṃbal did not yet
come to his senses but sat down with an army of horse and foot,
fortified with ditch and branch, to face The Khāns, between
Karnān and Akhsī. Several times over there was a little fighting
and pell-mell but without decided success to either side.</p>

<p>In the Andijān country (<i>wilāyat</i>), most of the tribes and
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;104b.</span>hordes and the forts and all the districts had come in to me;
naturally the Andijānīs also were wishing for me. They however
could not find their means.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>d. Bābur’s attempt to enter Andijān frustrated by a mistake.</i>)</p>

<p>It occurred to me that if we went one night close to the
town and sent a man in to discuss with the Khwāja<a name="FNanchor_630" id="FNanchor_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">630</a> and
notables, they might perhaps let us in somewhere. With this
idea we rode out from Aūsh. By midnight we were opposite
Forty-daughters (Chihil-dukhterān) 2 miles (one <i>kuroh</i>) from
Andijān. From that place we sent Qaṃbar-‘alī Beg forward,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
with some other begs, who were to discuss matters with the
Khwāja after by some means or other getting a man into the
fort. While waiting for their return, we sat on our horses,
some of us patiently humped up, some wrapt away in dream,
when suddenly, at about the third watch, there rose a war-cry<a name="FNanchor_631" id="FNanchor_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor">631</a>
and a sound of drums. Sleepy and startled, ignorant
whether the foe was many or few, my men, without looking to
one another, took each his own road and turned for flight.
There was no time for me to get at them; I went straight for
the enemy. Only Mīr Shāh <i>Qūchīn</i> and Bābā Sher-zād (Tiger-whelp)
and Nāṣir’s Dost sprang forward; we four excepted,
every man set his face for flight. I had gone a little way
forward, when the enemy rode rapidly up, flung out his war-cry
and poured arrows on us. One man, on a horse with
a starred forehead,<a name="FNanchor_632" id="FNanchor_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">632</a> came close to me; I shot at it; it rolled
over and died. They made a little as if to retire. The three<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;105.</span>
with me said, ‘In this darkness it is not certain whether they
are many or few; all our men have gone off; what harm could
we four do them? Fighting must be when we have overtaken
our run-aways and rallied them.’ Off we hurried, got up with
our men and beat and horse-whipped some of them, but, do
what we would, they would not make a stand. Back the four
of us went to shoot arrows at the foe. They drew a little back
but when, after a discharge or two, they saw we were not more
than three or four, they busied themselves in chasing and unhorsing
my men. I went three or four times to try to rally my
men but all in vain! They were not to be brought to order.
Back I went with my three and kept the foe in check with our
arrows. They pursued us two or three <i>kuroh</i> (4-6 m.), as far as
the rising ground opposite Kharābūk and Pashāmūn. There
we met Muḥ. ‘Alī <i>Mubashir</i>. Said I, ‘They are only few; let
us stop and put our horses at them.’ So we did. When we
got up to them, they stood still.<a name="FNanchor_633" id="FNanchor_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">633</a></p>

<p>Our scattered braves gathered in from this side and that, but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>several very serviceable men, scattering in this attack, went
right away to Aūsh.</p>

<p>The explanation of the affair seemed to be that some of
Ayūb <i>Begchīk’s</i> Mughūls had slipped away from Aūsh to raid
near Andijān and, hearing the noise of our troop, came somewhat
stealthily towards us; then there seems to have been confusion
about the pass-word. The pass-words settled on for use
during this movement of ours were Tāshkīnt and Sairām. If</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;105b.</span>(<i>Author’s note on pass-words.</i>) Pass-words are of two kinds;&mdash;in
each tribe there is one for use in the tribe, such as <i>Darwāna</i> or <i>Tūqqāī</i>
or <i>Lūlū</i>;<a name="FNanchor_634" id="FNanchor_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">634</a> and there is one for the use of the whole army. For a battle,
two words are settled on as pass-words so that of two men meeting
in the fight, one may give the one, the other give back the second,
in order to distinguish friends from foes, own men from strangers.</p></div>

<p>Tāshkīnt were said, Sairām would be answered; if Sairām,
Tāshkīnt. In this muddled affair, Khwāja Muḥ. ‘Ali seems to
have been somewhat in advance of our party and to have got
bewildered,&mdash;he was a Sārt person,<a name="FNanchor_635" id="FNanchor_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">635</a>&mdash;when the Mughūls came
up saying, ‘Tāshkīnt, Tāshkīnt,’ for he gave them ‘Tāshkīnt,
Tāshkīnt,’ as the counter-sign. Through this they took him
for an enemy, raised their war-cry, beat their saddle-drums and
poured arrows on us. It was through this we gave way, and
through this false alarm were scattered! We went back to
Aūsh.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>e. Bābur again attempts Andijān.</i>)</p>

<p>Through the return to me of the forts and the highland and
lowland clans, Taṃbal and his adherents lost heart and footing.
His army and people in the next five or six days began to
desert him and to flee to retired places and the open country.<a name="FNanchor_636" id="FNanchor_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">636</a>
Of his household some came and said, ‘His affairs are nearly
ruined; he will break up in three or four days, utterly ruined.’
On hearing this, we rode for Andijān.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>
<p>Sl. Muḥ. <i>Galpuk</i><a name="FNanchor_637" id="FNanchor_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor">637</a> was in Andijān,&mdash;the younger of Taṃbal’s
cadet brothers. We took the Mulberry-road and at the Mid-day
Prayer came to the Khākān (canal), south of the town. A<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;106.</span>
foraging-party was arranged; I followed it along Khākān to
the skirt of ‘Aīsh-hill. When our scouts brought word that
Sl. Muḥ. <i>Galpuk</i> had come out, with what men he had, beyond
the suburbs and gardens to the skirt of ‘Aīsh, I hurried to
meet him, although our foragers were still scattered. He may
have had over 500 men; we had more but many had scattered
to forage. When we were face to face, his men and ours may
have been in equal number. Without caring about order or
array, down we rode on them, loose rein, at the gallop. When
we got near, they could not stand; there was not so much
fighting as the crossing of a few swords. My men followed
them almost to the Khākān Gate, unhorsing one after another.</p>

<p>It was at the Evening Prayer that, our foe outmastered, we
reached Khwāja Kitta, on the outskirts of the suburbs. My
idea was to go quickly right up to the Gate but Dost Beg’s
father, Nāṣir Beg and Qaṃbar-‘alī Beg, old and experienced
begs both, represented to me, ‘It is almost night; it would be
ill-judged to go in a body into the fort in the dark; let us withdraw
a little and dismount. What can they do to-morrow but
surrender the place?’ Yielding at once to the opinion of these
experienced persons, we forthwith retired to the outskirts of the
suburbs. If we had gone to the Gate, undoubtedly, Andijān<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;106b.</span>
would have come into our hands.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>f. Bābur surprised by Taṃbal.</i>)</p>

<p>After crossing the Khākān-canal, we dismounted, near the
Bed-time prayer, at the side of the village of Rabāt̤-i-zauraq
(var. rūzaq). Although we knew that Taṃbal had broken
camp and was on his way to Andijān, yet, with the negligence of
inexperience, we dismounted on level ground close to the village,
instead of where the defensive canal would have protected us.<a name="FNanchor_638" id="FNanchor_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">638</a>
There we lay down carelessly, without scouts or rear-ward.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>
<p>At the top (<i>bāsh</i>) of the morning, just when men are in sweet
sleep, Qaṃbar-‘alī Beg hurried past, shouting, ‘Up with you!
the enemy is here!’ So much he said and went off without a
moment’s stay. It was my habit to lie down, even in times of
peace, in my tunic; up I got instanter, put on sword and
quiver and mounted. My standard-bearer had no time to
adjust my standard,<a name="FNanchor_639" id="FNanchor_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">639</a> he just mounted with it in his hand.
There were ten or fifteen men with me when we started
toward the enemy; after riding an arrow’s flight, when we
came up with his scouts, there may have been ten. Going
rapidly forward, we overtook him, poured in arrows on him,
over-mastered his foremost men and hurried them off. We
followed them for another arrow’s flight and came up with his
centre where Sl. Aḥmad <i>Taṃbal</i> himself was, with as many as
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;107.</span>100 men. He and another were standing in front of his array,
as if keeping a Gate,<a name="FNanchor_640" id="FNanchor_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor">640</a> and were shouting, ‘Strike, strike!’ but
his men, mostly, were sidling, as if asking themselves, ‘Shall
we run away? Shall we not?’ By this time three were left
with me; one was Nāṣir’s Dost, another, Mīrzā Qulī <i>Kūkūldāsh</i>,
the third, Khudāī-bīrdī <i>Turkmān’s</i> Karīm-dād.<a name="FNanchor_641" id="FNanchor_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">641</a> I shot off the
arrow on my thumb,<a name="FNanchor_642" id="FNanchor_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">642</a> aiming at Taṃbal’s helm. When I put
my hand into my quiver, there came out a quite new <i>gosha-gīr</i><a name="FNanchor_643" id="FNanchor_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">643</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>given me by my Younger Khān dādā. It would have been
vexing to throw it away but before I got it back into the quiver,
there had been time to shoot, maybe, two or three arrows.
When once more I had an arrow on the string, I went forward,
my three men even holding back. One of those two in advance,
Taṃbal seemingly,<a name="FNanchor_644" id="FNanchor_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">644</a> moved forward also. The high-road was
between us; I from my side, he, from his, got upon it and came
face to face, in such a way that his right hand was towards
me, mine towards him. His horse’s mail excepted, he was
fully accoutred; but for sword and quiver, I was unprotected.
I shot off the arrow in my hand, adjusting for the attachment
of his shield. With matters in this position, they shot my right
leg through. I had on the cap of my helm;<a name="FNanchor_645" id="FNanchor_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">645</a> Taṃbal chopped<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;107b.</span>
so violently at my head that it lost all feeling under the blow.
A large wound was made on my head, though not a thread of
the cap was cut.<a name="FNanchor_646" id="FNanchor_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">646</a> I had not bared<a name="FNanchor_647" id="FNanchor_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor">647</a> my sword; it was in the
scabbard and I had no chance to draw it. Single-handed, I
was alone amongst many foes. It was not a time to stand
still; I turned rein. Down came a sword again; this time
on my arrows. When I had gone 7 or 8 paces, those same
three men rejoined me.<a name="FNanchor_648" id="FNanchor_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor">648</a> After using his sword on me, Taṃbal
seems to have used it on Nāṣir’s Dost. As far as an arrrow
flies to the butt, the enemy followed us.</p>

<p>The Khākān-canal is a great main-channel, flowing in a
deep cutting, not everywhere to be crossed. God brought it
right! we came exactly opposite a low place where there was a
passage over. Directly we had crossed, the horse Nāṣir’s Dost
was on, being somewhat weakly, fell down. We stopped and remounted
him, then drew off for Aūsh, over the rising-ground
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>between Farāghīna and Khirābūk. Out on the rise, Mazīd
T̤aghāī came up and joined us. An arrow had pierced his
right leg also and though it had not gone through and come
out again, he got to Aūsh with difficulty. The enemy unhorsed
(<i>tūshūrdīlār</i>) good men of mine; Nāṣir Beg, Muḥ. ‘Alī
<i>Mubashir</i>, Khwāja Muḥ. ‘Alī, Khusrau <i>Kūkūldāsh</i>, Na‘man the
page, all fell (to them, <i>tūshtīlār</i>), and also many unmailed braves.<a name="FNanchor_649" id="FNanchor_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649" class="fnanchor">649</a></p>

<p class="indent">(<i>g. The Khāns move from Kāsān to Andijān.</i>)</p>

<p>The Khāns, closely following on Taṃbal, dismounted near
Andijān,&mdash;the Elder at the side of the Reserve (<i>qūrūq</i>) in the
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;108.</span>garden, known as Birds’-mill (<i>Qūsh-tīgīrmān</i>), belonging to my
grandmother, Aīsān-daulat Begīm,&mdash;the Younger, near Bābā
Tawakkul’s Alms-house. Two days later I went from Aūsh
and saw the Elder Khān in Birds’-mill. At that interview, he
simply gave over to the Younger Khān the places which had
come in to me. He made some such excuse as that for our advantage,
he had brought the Younger Khān, how far! because
such a foe as Shaibāq Khān had taken Samarkand and was
waxing greater; that the Younger Khān had there no lands
whatever, his own being far away; and that the country under
Andijān, on the south of the Khujand-water, must be given
him to encamp in. He promised me the country under Akhsī,
on the north of the Khujand-water. He said that after taking
a firm grip of that country (Farghāna), they would move, take
Samarkand, give it to me and then the whole of the Farghāna
country was to be the Younger Khan’s. These words seem to
have been meant to deceive me, since there is no knowing
what they would have done when they had attained their
object. It had to be however! willy-nilly, I agreed.</p>

<p>When, leaving him, I was on my way to the Younger
Khān’s presence, Qaṃbar-‘alī, known as the Skinner, joined me
in a friendly way and said, ‘Do you see? They have taken the
whole of the country just become yours. There is no opening
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>for you through them. You have in your hands Aūsh, Marghīnān,<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;108b.</span>
Aūzkīnt and the cultivated land and the tribes and the
hordes; go you to Aūsh; make that fort fast; send a man to
Taṃbal, make peace with him, then strike at the Mughūl and
drive him out. After that, divide the districts into an elder and
a younger brother’s shares.’ ‘Would that be right?’ said I.
‘The Khāns are my blood relations; better serve them than rule
for Taṃbal.’ He saw that his words had made no impression,
so turned back, sorry he had spoken. I went on to see my
Younger Khān Dādā. At our first interview, I had come upon
him without announcement and he had no time to dismount,
so it was all rather unceremonious. This time I got even
nearer perhaps, and he ran out as far as the end of the tent-ropes.
I was walking with some difficulty because of the
wound in my leg. We met and renewed acquaintance; then
he said, ‘You are talked about as a hero, my young brother!’
took my arm and led me into his tent. The tents pitched were
rather small and through his having grown up in an out-of-the-way
place, he let the one he sat in be neglected; it was like a
raider’s, melons, grapes, saddlery, every sort of thing, in his
sitting-tent. I went from his presence straight back to my
own camp and there he sent his Mughūl surgeon to examine
my wound. Mughūls call a surgeon also a <i>bakhshī</i>; this one
was called Ātākā Bakhshī.<a name="FNanchor_650" id="FNanchor_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor">650</a></p>

<p>He was a very skilful surgeon; if a man’s brains had come<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;109.</span>
out, he would cure it, and any sort of wound in an artery
he easily healed. For some wounds his remedy was in form of
a plaister, for some medicines had to be taken. He ordered a
bandage tied on<a name="FNanchor_651" id="FNanchor_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor">651</a> the wound in my leg and put no seton in;
once he made me eat something like a fibrous root (<i>yīldīz</i>).
He told me himself, ‘A certain man had his leg broken in the
slender part and the bone was shattered for the breadth of the
hand. I cut the flesh open and took the bits of bone out.
Where they had been, I put a remedy in powder-form. That
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>remedy simply became bone where there had been bone before.’
He told many strange and marvellous things such as surgeons
in cultivated lands cannot match.</p>

<p>Three or four days later, Qaṃbar-‘alī, afraid on account of
what he had said to me, fled (to Taṃbal) in Andijān. A few
days later, The Khāns joined to me Ayūb <i>Begchīk</i> with his
<i>tūmān</i>, and Jān-ḥasan <i>Bārīn</i> with the Bārīn <i>tūmān</i> and, as
their army-beg, Sārīgh-bāsh Mīrzā,&mdash;1000 to 2000 men in all,
and sent us towards Akhsī.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>h. Bābur’s expedition to Akhsī.</i>)</p>

<p>Shaikh Bāyazīd, a younger brother of Taṃbal, was in Akhsī;
Shahbāz <i>Qārlūq</i> was in Kāsān. At the time, Shahbāz was
lying before Nū-kīnt fort; crossing the Khujand-water opposite
Bīkhrātā, we hurried to fall upon him there. When, a little
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;109b.</span>before dawn, we were nearing the place, the begs represented
to me that as the man would have had news of us, it was
advisable not to go on in broken array. We moved on therefore
with less speed. Shahbāz may have been really unaware
of us until we were quite close; then getting to know of it, he
fled into the fort. It often happens so! Once having said,
‘The enemy is on guard!’ it is easily fancied true and the
chance of action is lost. In short, the experience of such
things is that no effort or exertion must be omitted, once the
chance for action comes. After-repentance is useless. There
was a little fighting round the fort at dawn but we delivered
no serious attack.</p>

<p>For the convenience of foraging, we moved from Nū-kīnt
towards the hills in the direction of Bīshkhārān. Seizing his
opportunity, Shahbāz <i>Qārlūq</i> abandoned Nū-kīnt and returned
to Kāsān. We went back and occupied Nū-kīnt. During those
days, the army several times went out and over-ran all sides and
quarters. Once they over-ran the villages of Akhsī, once
those of Kāsān. Shahbāz and Long Ḥasan’s adopted son,
Mīrīm came out of Kāsān to fight; they fought, were beaten,
and there Mīrīm died.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">(<i>i. The affairs of Pāp.</i>)</p>

<p>Pāp is a strong fort belonging to Akhsī. The Pāpīs made it
fast and sent a man to me. We accordingly sent Sayyid
Qāsim with a few braves to occupy it. They crossed the river<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;110.</span>
(<i>daryā</i>) opposite the upper villages of Akhsī and went into Pāp.<a name="FNanchor_652" id="FNanchor_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor">652</a>
A few days later, Sayyid Qāsim did an astonishing thing.
There were at the time with Shaikh Bāyazīd in Akhsī,
Ibrāhīm <i>Chāpūk</i> (Slash-face) T̤aghāī,<a name="FNanchor_653" id="FNanchor_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653" class="fnanchor">653</a> Aḥmad-of-qāsim <i>Kohbur</i>,
and Qāsim Khitika (?) <i>Arghūn</i>. To these Shaikh Bāyazīd
joins 200 serviceable braves and one night sends them to
surprise Pāp. Sayyid Qāsim must have lain down carelessly
to sleep, without setting a watch. They reach the fort, set
ladders up, get up on the Gate, let the drawbridge down and,
when 70 or 80 good men in mail are inside, goes the news to
Sayyid Qāsim! Drowsy with sleep, he gets into his vest
(<i>kūnglāk</i>), goes out, with five or six of his men, charges the enemy
and drives them out with blow upon blow. He cut off a few
heads and sent to me. Though such a careless lying down was
bad leadership, yet, with so few, just by force of drubbing,
to chase off such a mass of men in mail was very brave
indeed.</p>

<p>Meantime The Khāns were busy with the siege of Andijān
but the garrison would not let them get near it. The Andijān
braves used to make sallies and blows would be exchanged.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>j. Bābur invited into Akhsī.</i>)</p>

<p>Shaikh Bāyazīd now began to send persons to us from
Akhsī to testify to well-wishing and pressingly invite us to
Akhsī. His object was to separate me from The Khāns, by
any artifice, because without me, they had no standing-ground.<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;110b</span>
His invitation may have been given after agreeing with his elder
brother, Taṃbal that if I were separated from The Khāns, it
might be possible, in my presence, to come to some arrangement
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
with them. We gave The Khāns a hint of the invitation.
They said, ‘Go! and by whatever means, lay hands on Shaikh
Bāyazīd.’ It was not my habit to cheat and play false; here
above all places, when promises would have been made, how
was I to break them? It occurred to me however, that if we
could get into Akhsī, we might be able, by using all available
means, to detach Shaikh Bāyazīd from Taṃbal, when he might
take my side or something might turn up to favour my fortunes.
We, in our turn, sent a man to him; compact was made, he
invited us into Akhsī and when we went, came out to meet us,
bringing my younger brother, Nāṣir Mīrzā with him. Then he
took us into the town, gave us ground to camp in (<i>yūrt</i>) and to
me one of my father’s houses in the outer fort<a name="FNanchor_654" id="FNanchor_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654" class="fnanchor">654</a> where I
dismounted.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>k. Taṃbal asks help of Shaibāq Khān.</i>)</p>

<p>Taṃbal had sent his elder brother, Beg Tīlba, to Shaibāq
Khān with proffer of service and invitation to enter Farghāna.
At this very time Shaibāq Khān’s answer arrived; ‘I will
come,’ he wrote. On hearing this, The Khāns were all upset;
they could sit no longer before Andijān and rose from before it.</p>

<p>The Younger Khān himself had a reputation for justice and
orthodoxy, but his Mughūls, stationed, contrary to the expectations
of the towns-people, in Aūsh, Marghīnān and other
places,&mdash;places that had come in to me,&mdash;began to behave ill
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;111.</span>and oppressively. When The Khāns had broken up from before
Andijān, the Aūshīs and Marghīnānīs, rising in tumult, seized
the Mughūls in their forts, plundered and beat them, drove
them out and pursued them.</p>

<p>The Khāns did not cross the Khujand-water (for the
Kīndīrlīk-pass) but left the country by way of Marghīnān and
Kand-i-badām and crossed it at Khujand, Taṃbal pursuing
them as far as Marghīnān. We had had much uncertainty;
we had not had much confidence in their making any stand,
yet for us to go away, without clear reason, and leave them,
would not have looked well.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>l. Bābur attempts to defend Akhsī.</i>)</p>

<p>Early one morning, when I was in the Hot-bath, Jahāngīr
Mīrzā came into Akhsī, from Marghīnān, a fugitive from
Taṃbal. We saw one another, Shaikh Bāyazīd also being
present, agitated and afraid. The Mīrzā and Ibrāhīm Beg
said, ‘Shaikh Bāyazīd must be made prisoner and we must
get the citadel into our hands.’ In good sooth, the proposal
was wise. Said I, ‘Promise has been made; how can we
break it?’ Shaikh Bāyazīd went into the citadel. Men ought
to have been posted on the bridge; not even there did we post
any-one! These blunders were the fruit of inexperience. At
the top of the morning came Taṃbal himself with 2 or 3000
men in mail, crossed the bridge and went into the citadel. To
begin with I had had rather few men; when I first went into
Akhsī some had been sent to other forts and some had been
made commandants and summoners all round. Left with
me in Akhsī may have been something over 100 men. We<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;111b.</span>
had got to horse with these and were posting braves at the top
of one lane after another and making ready for the fight, when
Shaikh Bāyazīd and Qaṃbar-‘alī (the Skinner), and Muḥammad-dost<a name="FNanchor_655" id="FNanchor_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655" class="fnanchor">655</a>
came gallopping from Taṃbal with talk of peace.</p>

<p>After posting those told off for the fight, each in his appointed
place, I dismounted at my father’s tomb for a conference,
in which I invited Jahāngīr Mīrzā to join. Muḥammad-dost
went back to Taṃbal but Qaṃbar-‘alī and Shaikh Bāyazīd
were present. We sat in the south porch of the tomb and
were in consultation when the Mīrzā, who must have settled
beforehand with Ibrāhīm <i>Chāpūk</i> to lay hands on those other
two, said in my ear, ‘They must be made prisoner.’ Said I,
‘Don’t hurry! matters are past making prisoners. See here!
with terms made, the affair might be coaxed into something.
For why? Not only are they many and we few, but they with
their strength are in the citadel, we with our weakness, in the
outer fort.’ Shaikh Bāyazīd and Qaṃbar-‘alī both being
present, Jahāngīr Mīrzā looked at Ibrāhīm Beg and made him
a sign to refrain. Whether he misunderstood to the contrary
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>or whether he pretended to misunderstand, is not known;
suddenly he did the ill-deed of seizing Shaikh Bāyazīd. Braves
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;112.</span>closing in from all sides, flung those two to the ground.
Through this the affair was taken past adjustment; we gave
them into charge and got to horse for the coming fight.</p>

<p>One side of the town was put into Jahāngīr Mīrzā’s charge;
as his men were few, I told off some of mine to reinforce him.
I went first to his side and posted men for the fight, then to
other parts of the town. There is a somewhat level, open
space in the middle of Akhsī; I had posted a party of braves
there and gone on when a large body of the enemy, mounted
and on foot, bore down upon them, drove them from their post
and forced them into a narrow lane. Just then I came up (the
lane), gallopped my horse at them, and scattered them in flight.
While I was thus driving them out from the lane into the flat,
and had got my sword to work, they shot my horse in the leg;
it stumbled and threw me there amongst them. I got up
quickly and shot one arrow off. My squire, Kahil (lazy) had a
weakly pony; he got off and led it to me. Mounting this, I
started for another lane-head. Sl. Muḥ. Wais noticed the
weakness of my mount, dismounted and led me his own. I
mounted that horse. Just then, Qāsim Beg’s son, Qaṃbar-‘alī
came, wounded, from Jahāngīr Mīrzā and said the Mīrzā had
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;112b.</span>been attacked some time before, driven off in panic, and had
gone right away. We were thunderstruck! At the same
moment arrived Sayyid Qāsim, the commandant of Pāp! His
was a most unseasonable visit, since at such a crisis it was well
to have such a strong fort in our hands. Said I to Ibrāhīm
Beg, ‘What’s to be done now?’ He was slightly wounded;
whether because of this or because of stupefaction, he could
give no useful answer. My idea was to get across the bridge,
destroy it and make for Andijān. Bābā Sher-zād did very well
here. ‘We will storm out at the gate and get away at once,’
he said. At his word, we set off for the Gate. Khwāja Mīr
Mīrān also spoke boldly at that crisis. In one of the lanes,
Sayyid Qāsim and Nāṣir’s Dost chopped away at Bāqī Khīz,<a name="FNanchor_656" id="FNanchor_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656" class="fnanchor">656</a> I
being in front with Ibrāhīm Beg and Mīrzā Qulī <i>Kūkūldāsh</i>.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>
<p>As we came opposite the Gate, we saw Shaikh Bāyazīd, wearing
his pull-over shirt<a name="FNanchor_657" id="FNanchor_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657" class="fnanchor">657</a> above his vest, coming in with three or
four horsemen. He must have been put into the charge of
Jahāngīr’s men in the morning when, against my will, he was
made prisoner, and they must have carried him off when they
got away. They had thought it would be well to kill him;
they set him free alive. He had been released just when I
chanced upon him in the Gate. I drew and shot off the arrow
on my thumb; it grazed his neck, a good shot! He came confusedly
in at the Gate, turned to the right and fled down a lane.
We followed him instantly. Mīrzā Qulī <i>Kūkūldāsh</i> got at one
man with his rugged-mace and went on. Another man took<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;113.</span>
aim at Ibrāhīm Beg, but when the Beg shouted ‘Hāī! Hāī!’ let
him pass and shot me in the arm-pit, from as near as a man on
guard at a Gate. Two plates of my Qālmāq mail were cut;
he took to flight and I shot after him. Next I shot at a man
running away along the ramparts, adjusting for his cap against
the battlements; he left his cap nailed on the wall and went off,
gathering his turban-sash together in his hand. Then again,&mdash;a
man was in flight alongside me in the lane down which
Shaikh Bāyazīd had gone. I pricked the back of his head
with my sword; he bent over from his horse till he leaned
against the wall of the lane, but he kept his seat and with
some trouble, made good his flight. When we had driven all
the enemy’s men from the Gate, we took possession of it but
the affair was past discussion because they, in the citadel, were
2000 or 3000, we, in the outer fort, 100 or 200. Moreover they
had chased off Jahāngīr Mīrzā, as long before as it takes milk
to boil, and with him had gone half my men. This notwithstanding,
we sent a man, while we were in the Gate, to say to
him, ‘If you are near at hand, come, let us attack again.’
But the matter had gone past that! Ibrāhīm Beg, either
because his horse was really weak or because of his wound,
said, ‘My horse is done.’ On this, Sulaimān, one of Muḥ.
‘Alī’s <i>Mubashir’s</i> servants, did a plucky thing, for with matters<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;113b.</span>
as they were and none constraining him, while we were waiting
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
in the Gate, he dismounted and gave his horse to Ibrāhīm
Beg. Kīchīk (little) ‘Alī, now the Governor of Koel,<a name="FNanchor_658" id="FNanchor_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658" class="fnanchor">658</a> also
shewed courage while we were in the Gate; he was a retainer
of Sl. Muḥ. Wais and twice did well, here and in Aūsh. We
delayed in the Gate till those sent to Jahāngīr Mīrzā came back
and said he had gone off long before. It was too late to stay
there; off we flung; it was ill-judged to have stayed as long as
we did. Twenty or thirty men were with me. Just as we
hustled out of the Gate, a number of armed men<a name="FNanchor_659" id="FNanchor_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659" class="fnanchor">659</a> came right
down upon us, reaching the town-side of the drawbridge just as
we had crossed. Banda-‘alī, the maternal grandfather of
Qāsim Beg’s son, Ḥamza, called out to Ibrāhīm Beg, ‘You are
always boasting of your zeal! Let’s take to our swords!’
‘What hinders? Come along!’ said Ibrāhīm Beg, from beside
me. The senseless fellows were for displaying their zeal at a
time of such disaster! Ill-timed zeal! That was no time to
make stand or delay! We went off quickly, the enemy following
and unhorsing our men.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>m. Bābur a fugitive before Taṃbal’s men.</i>)</p>

<p>When we were passing Meadow-dome (Guṃbaz-i-chaman),
two miles out of Akhsī, Ibrāhīm Beg called out to me. Looking
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;114.</span>back, I saw a page of Shaikh Bāyazīd’s striking at him and
turned rein, but Bayān-qulī’s Khān-qulī, said at my side, ‘This
is a bad time for going back,’ seized my rein and pushed ahead.
Many of our men had been unhorsed before we reached Sang,
4 miles (2 <i>shar‘ī</i>) out of Akhsī.<a name="FNanchor_660" id="FNanchor_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor">660</a> Seeing no pursuers at Sang, we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
passed it by and turned straight up its water. In this position
of our affairs there were eight men of us;&mdash;Nāṣir’s Dost,
Qāsim Beg’s Qaṃbar-‘alī, Bayān-qulī’s Khān-qulī, Mīrzā Qulī
<i>Kūkūldāsh</i>, Nāṣir’s Shāham, Sayyidī Qarā’s ‘Abdu’l-qadūs,
Khwāja Ḥusainī and myself, the eighth. Turning up the
stream, we found, in the broad valley, a good little road, far
from the beaten track. We made straight up the valley,
leaving the stream on the right, reached its waterless part and,
near the Afternoon Prayer, got up out of it to level land.
When we looked across the plain, we saw a blackness on it,
far away. I made my party take cover and myself had gone
to look out from higher ground, when a number of men came
at a gallop up the hill behind us. Without waiting to know
whether they were many or few, we mounted and rode off.
There were 20 or 25; we, as has been said, were eight.
If we had known their number at first, we should have
made a good stand against them but we thought they would
not be pursuing us, unless they had good support behind. A<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;114b.</span>
fleeing foe, even if he be many, cannot face a few pursuers, for
as the saying is, ‘<i>Hāī</i> is enough for the beaten ranks.’<a name="FNanchor_661" id="FNanchor_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor">661</a></p>

<p>Khān-qulī said, ‘This will never do! They will take us all.
From amongst the horses there are, you take two good ones
and go quickly on with Mīrzā Qulī <i>Kūkūldāsh</i>, each with a led
horse. May-be you will get away.’ He did not speak ill; as
there was no fighting to hand, there was a chance of safety in
doing as he said, but it really would not have looked well to
leave any man alone, without a horse, amongst his foes. In
the end they all dropped off, one by one, of themselves. My
horse was a little tired; Khān-qulī dismounted and gave me
his; I jumped off at once and mounted his, he mine. Just
then they unhorsed Sayyidī Qarā’s ‘Abdu’l-qadūs and Nāṣir’s
Shāham who had fallen behind. Khān-qulī also was left. It
was no time to profer help or defence; on it was gone, at the
full speed of our mounts. The horses began to flag; Dost Beg’s
failed and stopped. Mine began to tire; Qaṃbar-‘alī got off
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>and gave me his; I mounted his, he mine. He was left.
Khwāja Ḥusainī was a lame man; he turned aside to the
higher ground. I was left with Mīrzā Qulī <i>Kūkūldāsh</i>. Our
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;115.</span>horses could not possibly gallop, they trotted. His began to
flag. Said I, ‘What will become of me, if you fall behind?
Come along! let’s live or die together.’ Several times I
looked back at him; at last he said, ‘My horse is done! It
can’t go on. Never mind me! You go on, perhaps you will
get away.’ It was a miserable position for me; he remained
behind, I was alone.</p>

<p>Two of the enemy were in sight, one Bābā of Sairām, the
other Banda-‘alī. They gained on me; my horse was done;
the mountains were still 2 miles (1 <i>kuroh</i>) off. A pile of rock
was in my path. Thought I to myself, ‘My horse is worn out
and the hills are still somewhat far away; which way should I
go? In my quiver are at least 20 arrows; should I dismount and
shoot them off from this pile of rock?’ Then again, I thought
I might reach the hills and once there, stick a few arrows in
my belt and scramble up. I had a good deal of confidence in
my feet and went on, with this plan in mind. My horse could
not possibly trot; the two men came within arrow’s reach.
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;115b.</span>For my own sake sparing my arrows, I did not shoot; they,
out of caution, came no nearer. By sunset I was near the
hills. Suddenly they called out, ‘Where are you going in this
fashion? Jahāngīr Mīrzā has been brought in a prisoner;
Nāṣir Mīrzā also is in their hands.’ I made no reply and went
on towards the hills. When a good distance further had been
gone, they spoke again, this time more respectfully, dismounting
to speak. I gave no ear to them but went on up a glen
till, at the Bed-time prayer, I reached a rock as big as a house.
Going behind it, I saw there were places to be jumped, where
no horse could go. They dismounted again and began to
speak like servants and courteously. Said they, ‘Where are
you going in this fashion, without a road and in the dark?
Sl. Aḥmad Taṃbal will make you <i>pādshāh</i>.’ They swore this.
Said I, ‘My mind is not easy as to that. I cannot go to him.
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;116.</span>If you think to do me timely service, years may pass before
you have such another chance. Guide me to a road by which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
I can go to The Khān’s presence. If you will do this, I will
shew you favour and kindness greater than your heart’s-desire.
If you will not do it, go back the way you came; that also
would be to serve me well.’ Said they, ‘Would to God we had
never come! But since we are here, after following you in the
way we have done, how can we go back from you? If you
will not go with us, we are at your service, wherever you go.’
Said I, ‘Swear that you speak the truth.’ They, for their part,
made solemn oath upon the Holy Book.</p>

<p>I at once confided in them and said, ‘People have shewn me
a road through a broad valley, somewhere near this glen; take
me to it.’ Spite of their oath, my trust in them was not so
complete but that I gave them the lead and followed. After 2
to 4 miles (1-2 <i>kuroh</i>), we came to the bed of a torrent. ‘This
will not be the road for the broad valley,’ I said. They drew
back, saying, ‘That road is a long way ahead,’ but it really must
have been the one we were on and they have been concealing
the fact, in order to deceive me. About half through the night,
we reached another stream. This time they said, ‘We have
been negligent; it now seems to us that the road through the
broad valley is behind.’ Said I, ‘What is to be done?’ Said
they, ‘The Ghawā road is certainly in front; by it people cross
for Far-kat.<a name="FNanchor_662" id="FNanchor_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor">662</a> They guided me for that and we went on till in<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;116b.</span>
the third watch of the night we reached the Karnān gully
which comes down from Ghawā. Here Bābā Sairāmī said,
‘Stay here a little while I look along the Ghawā road.’ He
came back after a time and said, ‘Some men have gone along
that road, led by one wearing a Mughūl cap; there is no going
that way.’ I took alarm at these words. There I was, at
dawn, in the middle of the cultivated land, far from the road I
wanted to take. Said I, ‘Guide me to where I can hide today,
and tonight when you will have laid hands on something
for the horses, lead me to cross the Khujand-water and along
its further bank.’ Said they, ‘Over there, on the upland, there
might be hiding.’</p>

<p>Banda-‘alī was Commandant in Karnān. ‘There is no doing
without food for ourselves or our horses;’ he said, ‘let me go
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>into Karnān and bring what I can find.’ We stopped 2 miles
(1 <i>kuroh</i>) out of Karnān; he went on. He was a long time
away; near dawn there was no sign of him. The day had shot
when he hurried up, bringing three loaves of bread but no corn
for the horses. Each of us putting a loaf into the breast of his
tunic, we went quickly up the rise, tethered our horses there in
the open valley and went to higher ground, each to keep watch.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;117.</span>Near mid-day, Aḥmad the Falconer went along the Ghawā
road for Akhsī. I thought of calling to him and of saying,
with promise and fair word, ‘You take those horses,’ for they
had had a day and a night’s strain and struggle, without corn,
and were utterly done. But then again, we were a little uneasy
as we did not entirely trust him. We decided that, as the
men Bābā Sairāmī had seen on the road would be in Karnān
that night, the two with me should fetch one of their horses
for each of us, and that then we should go each his own way.</p>

<p>At mid-day, a something glittering was seen on a horse, as
far away as eye can reach. We were not able to make out at
all what it was. It must have been Muḥ. Bāqir Beg himself;
he had been with us in Akhsī and when we got out and
scattered, he must have come this way and have been moving
then to a hiding-place.<a name="FNanchor_663" id="FNanchor_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor">663</a></p>

<p>Banda-‘alī and Bābā Sairāmī said, ‘The horses have had no
corn for two days and two nights; let us go down into the dale
and put them there to graze.’ Accordingly we rode down and
put them to the grass. At the Afternoon Prayer, a horseman
passed along the rising-ground where we had been. We
recognized him for Qādīr-bīrdī, the head-man of Ghawā. ‘Call
him,’ I said. They called; he came. After questioning him,
and speaking to him of favour and kindness, and giving him
promise and fair word, I sent him to bring rope, and a grass-hook,
and an axe, and material for crossing water,<a name="FNanchor_664" id="FNanchor_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor">664</a> and corn
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;117b.</span>for the horses, and food and, if it were possible, other horses.
We made tryst with him for that same spot at the Bed-time
Prayer.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>Near the Evening Prayer, a horseman passed from the
direction of Karnān for Ghawā. ‘Who are you?’ we asked.
He made some reply. He must have been Muḥ. Bāqir Beg
himself, on his way from where we had seen him earlier, going
at night-fall to some other hiding-place, but he so changed his
voice that, though he had been years with me, I did not know
it. It would have been well if I had recognized him and he
had joined me. His passing caused much anxiety and alarm;
tryst could not be kept with Qādīr-bīrdī of Ghawā. Banda-‘alī
said, ‘There are retired gardens in the suburbs of Karnān
where no one will suspect us of being; let us go there and
send to Qādīr-bīrdī and have him brought there.’ With this
idea, we mounted and went to the Karnān suburbs. It was
winter and very cold. They found a worn, coarse sheepskin
coat and brought it to me; I put it on. They brought me a
bowl of millet-porridge; I ate it and was wonderfully refreshed.
‘Have you sent off the man to Qādīr-bīrdī?’ said I
to Banda-‘alī. ‘I have sent,’ he said. But those luckless,
clownish mannikins seem to have agreed together to send the
man to Taṃbal in Akhsī!</p>

<p>We went into a house and for awhile my eyes closed in
sleep. Those mannikins artfully said to me, ‘You must not
bestir yourself to leave Karnān till there is news of Qādīr-bīrdī
but this house is right amongst the suburbs; on the outskirts
the orchards are empty; no-one will suspect if we go<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;118.</span>
there.’ Accordingly we mounted at mid-night and went to a
distant orchard. Bābā Sairāmī kept watch from the roof of a
house. Near mid-day he came down and said, ‘Commandant
Yūsuf is coming.’ Great fear fell upon me! ‘Find out,’ I
said, ‘whether he comes because he knows about me.’ He
went and after some exchange of words, came back and said,
‘He says he met a foot-soldier in the Gate of Akhsī who said to
him, “The pādshāh is in such a place,” that he told no-one,
put the man with Walī the Treasurer whom he had made
prisoner in the fight, and then gallopped off here.’ Said I,
‘How does it strike you?’ ‘They are all your servants,’ he
said, ‘you must go. What else can you do? They will make
you their ruler.’ Said I, ‘After such rebellion and fighting,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
with what confidence could I go?’ We were saying this,
when Yūsuf knelt before me, saying, ‘Why should it be hidden?
Sl. Aḥmad Taṃbal has no news of you, but Shaikh Bāyazīd
has and he sent me here.’ On hearing this, my state of mind
was miserable indeed, for well is it understood that nothing in
the world is worse than fear for one’s life. ‘Tell the truth!’ I
said, ‘if the affair is likely to go on to worse, I will make
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;118b.</span>ablution.’ Yūsuf swore oaths, but who would trust them? I
knew the helplessness of my position. I rose and went to
a corner of the garden, saying to myself, ‘If a man live a
hundred years or a thousand years, at the last nothing ...’<a name="FNanchor_665" id="FNanchor_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor">665</a></p>

<p class="center">TRANSLATOR’S NOTE.</p>

<p>Friends are likely to have rescued Bābur from his dangerous
isolation. His presence in Karnān was known both in Ghawā
and in Akhsī; Muḥ. Bāqir Beg was at hand (f. 117); some of
those he had dropped in his flight would follow him when their
horses had had rest; Jahāngīr was somewhere north of the
river with the half of Bābur’s former force (f. 112); The Khāns,
with their long-extended line of march, may have been on the
main road through or near Karnān. If Yūsuf took Bābur as a
prisoner along the Akhsī road, there were these various chances
of his meeting friends.</p>

<p>His danger was evaded; he joined his uncles and was with
them, leading 1000 men (Sh. N. p. 268), when they were
defeated at Archīān just before or in the season of Cancer, <i>i.e.</i>
<i>circa</i> June (T. R. p. 164). What he was doing between the
winter cold of Karnān (f. 117b) and June might have been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
known from his lost pages. Muḥ. Ṣāliḥ writes at length of one
affair falling within the time,&mdash;Jahāngīr’s occupation of Khujand,
its siege and its capture by Shaibānī. This capture will
have occurred considerably more than a month before the
defeat of The Khāns (Sh. N. p. 230).</p>

<p>It is not easy to decide in what month of 908 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> they went
into Farghāna or how long their campaign lasted. Bābur
chronicles a series of occurrences, previous to the march of the
army, which must have filled some time. The road over the
Kīndīrlīk-pass was taken, one closed in Bābur’s time (f. 1b)
though now open through the winter. Looking at the rapidity
of his own movements in Farghāna, it seems likely that the pass
was crossed after and not before its closed time. If so, the
campaign may have covered 4 or 5 months. Muḥ. Ṣāliḥ’s
account of Shaibāq’s operations strengthens this view. News
that Aḥmad had joined Maḥmūd in Tāshkīnt (f. 102) went to
Shaibānī in Khusrau Shāh’s territories; he saw his interests in
Samarkand threatened by this combination of the Chaghatāī
brothers to restore Bābur in Farghāna, came north therefore in
order to help Taṃbal. He then waited a month in Samarkand
(Sh. N. p. 230), besieged Jahāngīr, went back and stayed in
Samarkand long enough to give his retainers time to equip for
a year’s campaigning (l. c. p. 244) then went to Akhsī and so
to Archīān.</p>

<p>Bābur’s statement (f. 110b) that The Khāns went from Andijān
to the Khujand-crossing over the Sīr attracts attention
because this they might have done if they had meant to leave
Farghāna by Mīrzā-rabāt̤ but they are next heard of as at Akhsī.
Why did they make that great détour? Why not have crossed
opposite Akhsī or at Sang? Or if they had thought of retiring,
what turned them east again? Did they place Jahāngīr in
Khujand? Bābur’s missing pages would have answered these
questions no doubt. It was useful for them to encamp where
they did, east of Akhsī, because they there had near them a road
by which reinforcement could come from Kāshghar or retreat
be made. The Akhsī people told Shaibānī that he could easily
overcome The Khāns if he went without warning, and if they
had not withdrawn by the Kulja road (Sh. N. p. 262). By that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
road the few men who went with Aḥmad to Tāshkīnt (f. 103)
may have been augmented to the force, enumerated as his in
the battle by Muḥ. Ṣāliḥ (Sh. N. cap. <span class="smcap">LIII.</span>).</p>

<p>When The Khāns were captured, Bābur escaped and made
‘for Mughūlistān,’ a vague direction seeming here to mean
Tāshkīnt, but, finding his road blocked, in obedience to orders
from Shaibāq that he and Abū’l-makāram were to be captured,
he turned back and, by unfrequented ways, went into the hill-country
of Sūkh and Hushīār. There he spent about a year
in great misery (f. 14 and Ḥ. S. ii, 318). Of the wretchedness
of the time Ḥaidar also writes. If anything was attempted in
Farghāna in the course of those months, record of it has been
lost with Bābur’s missing pages. He was not only homeless
and poor, but shut in by enemies. Only the loyalty or kindness
of the hill-tribes can have saved him and his few followers.
His mother was with him; so also were the families of his men.
How Qūtlūq-nigār contrived to join him from Tāshkīnt, though
historically a small matter, is one he would chronicle. What
had happened there after the Mughūl defeat, was that the
horde had marched away for Kāshghar while Shāh Begīm
remained in charge of her daughters with whom the Aūzbeg
chiefs intended to contract alliance. Shaibānī’s orders for her
stay and for the general exodus were communicated to her by
her son, The Khān, in what Muḥ. Ṣāliḥ, quoting its purport,
describes as a right beautiful letter (p. 296).</p>

<p>By some means Qūtlūq-nigār joined Bābur, perhaps helped
by the circumstance that her daughter, Khān-zāda was
Shaibāq’s wife. She spent at least some part of those hard
months with him, when his fortunes were at their lowest ebb.
A move becoming imperative, the ragged and destitute company
started in mid-June 1504 (Muḥ. 910 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>) on that perilous
mountain journey to which Ḥaidar applies the Prophet’s
dictum, ‘Travel is a foretaste of Hell,’ but of which the end
was the establishment of a Tīmūrid dynasty in Hindūstān.
To look down the years from the destitute Bābur to Akbar,
Shāh-jahān and Aurangzīb is to see a great stream of human
life flow from its source in his resolve to win upward, his
quenchless courage and his abounding vitality. Not yet 22,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]<br />[Pg 186]</a></span>
the sport of older men’s intrigues, he had been tempered by
failure, privation and dangers.</p>

<p>He left Sūkh intending to go to Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā in
Khurāsān but he changed this plan for one taking him to
Kābul where a Tīmūrid might claim to dispossess the Arghūns,
then holding it since the death, in 907 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>of his uncle,
Aūlūgh Beg Mīrzā <i>Kābulī</i>.</p>

<p>In the month of Muḥarram, after leaving the Farghāna country<span class="sidenote">Ḥaidarābād&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> MS. Fol.&nbsp;120.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>

of the summer pastures of Ḥiṣār. In this camp I entered my

hoping in me, went with me into exile, were, small and great,
between 2 and 300; they were almost all on foot, had walking-staves
in their hands, brogues<a name="FNanchor_670" id="FNanchor_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor">670</a> on their feet, and long coats<a name="FNanchor_671" id="FNanchor_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671" class="fnanchor">671</a> on

(<i>chādar</i>) amongst us; my own used to be pitched for my mother,
and they set an <i>ālāchūq</i> at each stage for me to sit in.<a name="FNanchor_672" id="FNanchor_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor">672</a></p>

<p>Though we had started with the intention of going into
Khurāsān, yet with things as they were<a name="FNanchor_673" id="FNanchor_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673" class="fnanchor">673</a> something was hoped
for from the Ḥiṣār country and Khusrau Shāh’s retainers.
Every few days some-one would come in from the country or
a tribe or the (Mughūl) horde, whose words made it probable
that we had growing ground for hope. Just then Mullā Bābā
of Pashāghar came back, who had been our envoy to Khusrau
Shāh; from Khusrau Shāh he brought nothing likely to please,
but he did from the tribes and the horde.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;120b.</span>Three or four marches beyond Aīlāk, when halt was made at a
place near Ḥiṣār called Khwāja ‘Imād, Muḥibb-‘alī, the Armourer,
came to me from Khusrau Shāh. Through Khusrau Shāh’s
territories I have twice happened to pass;<a name="FNanchor_674" id="FNanchor_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor">674</a> renowned though he
was for kindness and liberality, he neither time showed me the
humanity he had shown to the meanest of men.</p>

<p>As we were hoping something from the country and the
tribes, we made delay at every stage. At this critical point
Sherīm T̤aghāī, than whom no man of mine was greater,
thought of leaving me because he was not keen to go into
Khurāsān. He had sent all his family off and stayed himself
unencumbered, when after the defeat at Sar-i-pul (906 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>) I went
back to defend Samarkand; he was a bit of a coward and he did
this sort of thing several times over.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>b. Bābur joined by one of Khusrau Shāh’s kinsmen.</i>)</p>

<p>After we reached Qabādīān, a younger brother of Khusrau
Shāh, Bāqī <i>Chaghānīānī</i>, whose holdings were Chaghānīān,<a name="FNanchor_675" id="FNanchor_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor">675</a>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>express his good wishes and his desire for alliance, and, after we
had crossed the Amū at the Aūbāj-ferry, he came himself to
wait on me. By his wish we moved down the river to opposite
Tīrmīẕ, where, without fear [or, without going over himself],<a name="FNanchor_677" id="FNanchor_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677" class="fnanchor">677</a> he
had their families<a name="FNanchor_678" id="FNanchor_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor">678</a> and their goods brought across to join us.
This done, we set out together for Kāhmard and Bāmīān, then
held by his son<a name="FNanchor_679" id="FNanchor_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor">679</a> Aḥmad-i-qāsim, the son of Khusrau Shāh’s
sister. Our plan was to leave the households (<i>awī-aīl</i>) safe in
Fort Ajar of the Kāhmard-valley and to take action wherever<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;121.</span>
action might seem well. At Aībak, Yār-‘alī Balāl,<a name="FNanchor_680" id="FNanchor_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor">680</a> who had
fled from Khusrau Shāh, joined us with several braves; he had
been with me before, and had made good use of his sword
several times in my presence, but was parted from me in the
recent throneless times<a name="FNanchor_681" id="FNanchor_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681" class="fnanchor">681</a> and had gone to Khusrau Shāh. He
represented to me that the Mughūls in Khusrau Shāh’s service
wished me well. Moreover, Qaṃbar-‘alī Beg, known also as
Qaṃbar-‘alī <i>Silākh</i> (Skinner), fled to me after we reached
the Zindān-valley.<a name="FNanchor_682" id="FNanchor_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682" class="fnanchor">682</a></p>

<p class="indent">(<i>c. Occurrences in Kākmard.</i>)</p>

<p>We reached Kāhmard with three or four marches and
deposited our households and families in Ajar. While we
stayed there, Jahāngīr Mīrzā married (Aī Begīm) the daughter
of Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā and Khān-zāda Begīm, who had been
set aside for him during the lifetime of the Mīrzās.<a name="FNanchor_683" id="FNanchor_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor">683</a></p>

<p>Meantime Bāqī Beg urged it upon me, again and again, that
two rulers in one country, or two chiefs in one army are a source
of faction and disorder&mdash;a foundation of dissension and ruin.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>“For they have said, ‘Ten darwīshes can sleep under one blanket,

</div></div></div>

<p>Bāqī Beg urged further that Khusrau Shāah’s retainers and
followers would be coming in that day or the next to take
service with the Pādshāh (<i>i.e.</i> Bābur); that there were such
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;121b.</span>sedition-mongers with them as the sons of Ayūb <i>Begchīk</i>,
besides other who had been the stirrers and spurs to disloyalty
amongst their Mīrzās,<a name="FNanchor_685" id="FNanchor_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685" class="fnanchor">685</a> and that if, at this point, Jahāngīr Mīrzā
were dismissed, on good and friendly terms, for Khurāsān, it
would remove a source of later repentance. Urge it as he would,
however, I did not accept his suggestion, because it is against
my nature to do an injury to my brethren, older or younger,<a name="FNanchor_686" id="FNanchor_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686" class="fnanchor">686</a>
or to any kinsman soever, even when something untoward has
happened. Though formerly between Jahāngīr Mīrzā and me,
resentments and recriminations had occurred about our rule
and retainers, yet there was nothing whatever then to arouse
anger against him; he had come out of that country
(<i>i.e.</i> Farghāna) with me and was behaving like a blood-relation
and a servant. But in the end it was just as Bāqī Beg
predicted;&mdash;those tempters to disloyalty, that is to say, Ayūb’s
Yūsuf and Ayūb’s Bihlūl, left me for Jahāngīr Mīrzā, took up
a hostile and mutinous position, parted him from me, and
conveyed him into Khurāsān.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>d. Co-operation invited against Shaibāq Khān.</i>)</p>

<p>In those days came letters from Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā, long and
far-fetched letters which are still in my possession and in that
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;122.</span>of others, written to Badī‘u’z-zamān Mīrzā, myself, Khusrau
Shāh and Ẕū’n-nūn Beg, all to the same purport, as follows:&mdash;“When
the three brothers, Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā, Sl. Aḥmad
Mīrzā, and Aūlūgh Beg Mīrzā, joined together and advanced
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>against me, I defended the bank of the Murgh-āb<a name="FNanchor_687" id="FNanchor_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687" class="fnanchor">687</a> in such
a way that they retired without being able to effect anything.
Now if the Aūzbegs advance, I might myself guard the bank of
the Murgh-āb again; let Badī‘u’z-zamān Mīrzā leave men to
defend the forts of Balkh, Shibarghān, and Andikhūd while he
himself guards Girzawān, the Zang-valley, and the hill-country
thereabouts.” As he had heard of my being in those parts, he
wrote to me also, “Do you make fast Kāhmard, Ajar, and that
hill-tract; let Khusrau Shāh place trusty men in Ḥiṣār and
Qūndūz; let his younger brother Walī make fast Badakhshān
and the Khutlān hills; then the Aūzbeg will retire, able to do
nothing.”</p>

<p>These letters threw us into despair;&mdash;for why? Because at
that time there was in Tīmūr Beg’s territory (<i>yūrt</i>) no ruler so
great as Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā, whether by his years, armed strength,
or dominions; it was to be expected, therefore, that envoys
would go, treading on each other’s heels, with clear and sharp
orders, such as, “Arrange for so many boats at the Tīrmīz,<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;122b.</span>
Kilīf, and Kīrkī ferries,” “Get any quantity of bridge material
together,” and “Well watch the ferries above Tūqūz-aūlūm,”<a name="FNanchor_688" id="FNanchor_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688" class="fnanchor">688</a>
so that men whose spirit years of Aūzbeg oppression had
broken, might be cheered to hope again.<a name="FNanchor_689" id="FNanchor_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689" class="fnanchor">689</a> But how could hope
live in tribe or horde when a great ruler like Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā,
sitting in the place of Tīmūr Beg, spoke, not of marching forth
to meet the enemy, but only of defence against his attack?</p>

<p>When we had deposited in Ajar what had come with us of
hungry train (<i>aj aūrūq</i>) and household (<i>awī-aīl</i>), together with
the families of Bāqī Beg, his son, Muḥ. Qāsim, his soldiers
and his tribesmen, with all their goods, we moved out with
our men.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>e. Increase of Bābur’s following.</i>)</p>

<p>One man after another came in from Khusrau Shāh’s
Mughūls and said, “We of the Mughūl horde, desiring the
royal welfare, have drawn off from T̤āīkhān (T̤ālīkān) towards
Ishkīmīsh and Fūlūl. Let the Pādshāh advance as fast as
possible, for the greater part of Khusrau Shāh’s force has
broken up and is ready to take service with him.” Just then
news arrived that Shaibāq Khān, after taking Andijān,<a name="FNanchor_690" id="FNanchor_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690" class="fnanchor">690</a> was
getting to horse again against Ḥiṣār and Qūndūz. On hearing
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;123.</span>this, Khusrau Shāh, unable to stay in Qūndūz, marched out
with all the men he had, and took the road for Kābul. No
sooner had he left than his old servant, the able and trusted
Mullā Muḥammad <i>Turkistānī</i> made Qūndūz fast for Shaibāq
Khān.</p>

<p>Three or four thousand heads-of-houses in the Mughūl horde,
former dependants of Khusrau Shāh, brought their families and
joined us when, going by way of Sham-tū, we were near the

gratify Bāqī Beg, he was dismissed. Thereafter his son,
‘Abdu’l-shukūr, was in Jahāngīr Mīrzā’s service.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>g. Khusrau Shāh waits on Bābur.</i>)</p>

<p>Khusrau Shāh was much upset when he heard that the
Mughūl horde had joined me; seeing nothing better to do
for himself, he sent his son-in-law, Ayūb’s Yaq‘ūb, to make
profession of well-wishing and submission to me, and respectfully
to represent that he would enter my service if I would
make terms and compact with him. His offer was accepted,
because Bāqī <i>Chaghānīānī</i> was a man of weight, and, however
steady in his favourable disposition to me, did not overlook his
brother’s side in this matter. Compact was made that Khusrau
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>Shāh’s life should be safe, and that whatever amount of his
goods he selected, should not be refused him. After giving
Yaq‘ūb leave to go, we marched down the Qīzīl-sū and dismounted
near to where it joins the water of Andar-āb.<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;123b.</span></p>

<p>Next day, one in the middle of the First Rabī‘ (end of
August, 1504 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>), riding light, I crossed the Andar-āb water and
took my seat under a large plane-tree near Dūshī, and thither
came Khusrau Shāh, in pomp and splendour, with a great
company of men. According to rule and custom, he dismounted
some way off and then made his approach. Three times he
knelt when we saw one another, three times also on taking
leave; he knelt once when asking after my welfare, once again
when he offered his tribute, and he did the same with Jahāngīr
Mīrzā and with Mīrzā Khān (Wais). That sluggish old
mannikin who through so many years had just pleased himself,
lacking of sovereignty one thing only, namely, to read the
<i>Khut̤ba</i> in his own name, now knelt 25 or 26 times in
succession, and came and went till he was so wearied out that
he tottered forward. His many years of begship and authority
vanished from his view. When we had seen one another and
he had offered his gift, I desired him to be seated. We stayed
in that place for one or two <i>garīs</i>,<a name="FNanchor_692" id="FNanchor_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692" class="fnanchor">692</a> exchanging tale and talk.
His conversation was vapid and empty, presumably because he
was a coward and false to his salt. Two things he said were
extraordinary for the time when, under his eyes, his trusty and
trusted retainers were becoming mine, and when his affairs had
reached the point that he, the sovereign-aping mannikin, had
had to come, willy-nilly, abased and unhonoured, to what sort<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;124.</span>
of an interview! One of the things he said was this:&mdash;When
condoled with for the desertion of his men, he replied, “Those
very servants have four times left me and returned.” The
other was said when I had asked him where his brother Walī
would cross the Amū and when he would arrive. “If he find
a ford, he will soon be here, but when waters rise, fords change;
the (Persian) proverb has it, ‘The waters have carried down
the fords.’” These words God brought to his tongue in that
hour of the flowing away of his own authority and following!</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>
<p>After sitting a <i>garī</i> or two, I mounted and rode back to camp,
he for his part returning to his halting-place. On that day his
begs, with their servants, great and small, good and bad, and
tribe after tribe began to desert him and come, with their
families, to me. Between the two Prayers of the next afternoon
not a man remained in his presence.</p>

man He so abased and so bereft of power that, with no blow
struck, no sound made, he stood, without command over

300 men, defeated and destitute as we were.</p>

<p>In the evening of the day on which we had seen Khusrau
Shāh and gone back to camp, Mīrzā Khān came to my presence
and demanded vengeance on him for the blood of his brothers.<a name="FNanchor_695" id="FNanchor_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor">695</a>
Many of us were at one with him, for truly it is right, both by
Law and common justice, that such men should get their desserts,
but, as terms had been made, Khusrau Shāh was let go free.

<p>Marching from that camp for Kābul, we dismounted in

<p>On that day, Ḥamza Bī <i>Mangfīt</i>,<a name="FNanchor_697" id="FNanchor_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697" class="fnanchor">697</a> at the head of Aūzbeg

the Lord of the Gate, and Aḥmad-i-qāsim <i>Kohbur</i> were sent<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;125.</span>
with several braves against him; they got up with him, beat
his Aūzbegs well, cut off and brought in a few heads.</p>

<p>In this camp all the armour (<i>jība</i>) of Khusrau Shāh’s
armoury was shared out. There may have been as many as
7 or 800 coats-of-mail (<i>joshan</i>) and horse accoutrements
(<i>kūhah</i>);<a name="FNanchor_698" id="FNanchor_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698" class="fnanchor">698</a> these were the one thing he left behind; many
pieces of porcelain also fell into our hands, but, these excepted,
there was nothing worth looking at.</p>

<p>With four or five marches we reached Ghūr-bund, and there
dismounted in Ushtur-shahr. We got news there that Muqīm’s
chief beg, Sherak (var. Sherka) <i>Arghūn</i>, was lying along the Bārān,
having led an army out, not through hearing of me, but to hinder
‘Abdu’r-razzāq Mīrzā from passing along the Panjhīr-road, he
having fled from Kābul<a name="FNanchor_699" id="FNanchor_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699" class="fnanchor">699</a> and being then amongst the Tarkalānī
Afghāns towards Lamghān. On hearing this we marched forward,

and straightway got to grips with him. After a little of
some sort of fighting, our men took the upper hand, hurried their

them in. We gave Sherak his life and he took service with us.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>i. Death of Walī of Khusrau.</i>)</p>

<p>The various clans and tribes whom Khusrau Shāh, without
troubling himself about them, had left in Qūndūz, and also the
Mughūl horde, were in five or six bodies (<i>būlāk</i>). One of those
belonging to Badakhshān,&mdash;it was the Rūstā-hazāra,:&mdash;came, with
Sayyidīm ‘Alī <i>darbān</i>,<a name="FNanchor_705" id="FNanchor_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705" class="fnanchor">705</a> across the Panjhīr-pass to this camp,
did me obeisance and took service with me. Another body
came under Ayūb’s Yūsuf and Ayūb’s Bihlūl; it also took
service with me. Another came from Khutlān, under Khusrau
Shāh’s younger brother, Walī; another, consisting of the
(Mughūl) tribesmen (<i>aīmāq</i>) who had been located in Yīlānchaq,
Nikdiri (?), and the Qūndūz country, came also. The last-named
two came by Andar-āb and Sar-i-āb,<a name="FNanchor_706" id="FNanchor_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706" class="fnanchor">706</a> meaning to cross
by the Panjhīr-pass; at Sar-i-āb the tribesmen were ahead;
Walī came up behind; they held the road, fought and beat
him. He himself fled to the Aūzbegs,<a name="FNanchor_707" id="FNanchor_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707" class="fnanchor">707</a> and Shaibāq Khān had
his head struck off in the Square (<i>Chār-sū</i>) of Samarkand; his
followers, beaten and plundered, came on with the tribesmen,
and like these, took service with me. With them came Sayyid
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;126.</span>Yūsuf Beg (the Grey-wolfer).</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>j. Kābul gained.</i>)</p>

<p>From that camp we marched to the Āq-sarāī meadow of the
Qarā-bāgh and there dismounted. Khusrau Shāh’s people were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>well practised in oppression and violence; they tyrannized over
one after another till at last I had up one of Sayyidīm ‘Alī’s
good braves to my Gate<a name="FNanchor_708" id="FNanchor_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708" class="fnanchor">708</a> and there beaten for forcibly taking
a jar of oil. There and then he just died under the blows; his
example kept the rest down.</p>

<p>We took counsel in that camp whether or not to go at once
against Kābul. Sayyid Yūsuf and some others thought that,
as winter was near, our first move should be into Lamghān,
from which place action could be taken as advantage offered.
Bāqī Beg and some others saw it good to move on Kābul at
once; this plan was adopted; we marched forward and dismounted
in Ābā-qūrūq.</p>

<p>My mother and the belongings left behind in Kāhmard
rejoined us at Ābā-qūrūq. They had been in great danger,
the particulars of which are these:&mdash;Sherīm T̤aghāī had gone
to set Khusrau Shāh on his way for Khurāsān, and this done,
was to fetch the families from Kāhmard. When he reached
Dahānah, he found he was not his own master; Khusrau Shāh
went on with him into Kāhmard, where was his sister’s son,
Aḥmad-i-qāsim. These two took up an altogether wrong<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;126b.</span>
position towards the families in Kāhmard. Hereupon a number
of Bāqī Beg’s Mughūls, who were with the families, arranged
secretly with Sherīm T̤aghāī to lay hands on Khusrau Shāh
and Aḥmad-i-qāsim. The two heard of it, fled along the
Kāhmard-valley on the Ajar side<a name="FNanchor_709" id="FNanchor_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709" class="fnanchor">709</a> and made for Khurāsān.
To bring this about was really what Sherīm T̤aghāī and the
Mughūls wanted. Set free from their fear of Khusrau Shāh by
his flight, those in charge of the families got them out of Ajar,
but when they reached Kāhmard, the Sāqānchī (var. Asīqanchī)
tribe blocked the road, like an enemy, and plundered the
families of most of Bāqī Beg’s men.<a name="FNanchor_710" id="FNanchor_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710" class="fnanchor">710</a> They made prisoner
Qul-i-bāyazīd’s little son, Tīzak; he came into Kābul three or
four years later. The plundered and unhappy families crossed
by the Qībchāq-pass, as we had done, and they rejoined us in
Ābā-qūrūq.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>Leaving that camp we went, with one night’s halt, to the
Chālāk-meadow, and there dismounted. After counsel taken,
it was decided to lay siege to Kābul, and we marched forward.
With what men of the centre there were, I dismounted between
Ḥaidar <i>Tāqī’s</i><a name="FNanchor_711" id="FNanchor_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711" class="fnanchor">711</a> garden and the tomb of Qul-i-bāyazīd, the
Taster (<i>bakāwal</i>);<a name="FNanchor_712" id="FNanchor_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712" class="fnanchor">712</a> Jahāngīr Mīrzā, with the men of the right,
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;127.</span>dismounted in my great Four-gardens (<i>Chār-bāgh</i>), Nāṣir
Mīrzā, with the left, in the meadow of Qūtlūq-qadam’s tomb.
People of ours went repeatedly to confer with Muqīm; they
sometimes brought excuses back, sometimes words making for
agreement. His tactics were the sequel of his dispatch, directly
after Sherak’s defeat, of a courier to his father and elder brother
(in Qandahār); he made delays because he was hoping in them.</p>

<p>One day our centre, right, and left were ordered to put on
their mail and their horses’ mail, to go close to the town, and
to display their equipment so as to strike terror on those within.
Jahāngīr Mīrzā and the right went straight forward by the
Kūcha-bāgh;<a name="FNanchor_713" id="FNanchor_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713" class="fnanchor">713</a> I, with the centre, because there was water,
went along the side of Qūtlūq-qadam’s tomb to a mound
facing the rising-ground;<a name="FNanchor_714" id="FNanchor_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714" class="fnanchor">714</a> the van collected above Qūtlūq-qadam’s
bridge,&mdash;at that time, however, there was no bridge.
When the braves, showing themselves off, galloped close up
to the Curriers'-gate,<a name="FNanchor_715" id="FNanchor_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715" class="fnanchor">715</a> a few who had come out through it fled
in again without making any stand. A crowd of Kābulīs who
had come out to see the sight raised a great dust when they
ran away from the high slope of the glacis of the citadel
(<i>i.e.</i> Bālā-ḥiṣār). A number of pits had been dug up the rise
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;127b.</span>between the bridge and the gate, and hidden under sticks and
rubbish; Sl. Qulī <i>Chūnāq</i> and several others were thrown as
they galloped over them. A few braves of the right exchanged
sword-cuts with those who came out of the town, in amongst
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>the lanes and gardens, but as there was no order to engage,
having done so much, they retired.</p>

<p>Those in the fort becoming much perturbed, Muqīm made
offer through the begs, to submit and surrender the town. Bāqī
Beg his mediator, he came and waited on me, when all fear was
chased from his mind by our entire kindness and favour. It was
settled that next day he should march out with retainers and
following, goods and effects, and should make the town over to
us. Having in mind the good practice Khusrau Shāh’s retainers
had had in indiscipline and longhandedness, we appointed
Jahāngīr Mīrzā and Nāṣir Mīrzā with the great and household
begs, to escort Muqīm’s family out of Kābul<a name="FNanchor_716" id="FNanchor_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716" class="fnanchor">716</a> and to bring out
Muqīm himself with his various dependants, goods and effects.
Camping-ground was assigned to him at Tīpa.<a name="FNanchor_717" id="FNanchor_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717" class="fnanchor">717</a> When the
Mīrzās and the Begs went at dawn to the Gate, they saw much
mobbing and tumult of the common people, so they sent me a
man to say, “Unless you come yourself, there will be no holding
these people in.” In the end I got to horse, had two or three
persons shot, two or three cut in pieces, and so stamped the rising
down. Muqīm and his belongings then got out, safe and sound,<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;128.</span>
and they betook themselves to Tīpa.</p>

<p>It was in the last ten days of the Second Rabī‘ (Oct. 1504 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>)<a name="FNanchor_718" id="FNanchor_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718" class="fnanchor">718</a>
that without a fight, without an effort, by Almighty God’s bounty
and mercy, I obtained and made subject to me Kābul and Ghaznī
and their dependent districts.</p>

<p>The Kābul district itself is of small extent, has its greatest
length from east to west, and is girt round by mountains. Its
walled-town connects with one of these, rather a low one known
as Shāh-of-Kābul because at some time a (Hindū) Shāh of
Kābul built a residence on its summit.<a name="FNanchor_723" id="FNanchor_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723" class="fnanchor">723</a> Shāh-of-Kābul begins

it may be 4 miles (2 <i>shar‘ī</i>) round; its skirt is covered with
gardens fertilized from a canal which was brought along the

by his guardian, Wais Atāka.<a name="FNanchor_725" id="FNanchor_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725" class="fnanchor">725</a> The water of this canal comes

a large pool<a name="FNanchor_728" id="FNanchor_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728" class="fnanchor">728</a> about a 2 miles [<i>shar‘ī</i>] round. From the town

overlooking the large pool already mentioned, and also three
meadows, namely, Siyāh-sang (Black-rock), Sūng-qūrghān
(Fort-back), and Chālāk (Highwayman?),&mdash;a most beautiful
outlook when the meadows are green. The north-wind does
not fail Kābul in the heats; people call it the Parwān-wind<a name="FNanchor_732" id="FNanchor_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732" class="fnanchor">732</a>;

<p>Just as ‘Arabs call every place outside ‘Arab (Arabia), ‘Ajam,
so Hindūstānīs call every place outside Hindūstān, Khurāsān.
There are two trade-marts on the land-route between Hindūstān
and Khurāsān; one is Kābul, the other, Qandahār. To Kābul
caravans come from Kāshghar,<a name="FNanchor_735" id="FNanchor_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735" class="fnanchor">735</a> Farghāna,Turkistān, Samarkand,
Bukhārā, Balkh, Ḥiṣār and Badakhshān. To Qandahār they
come from Khurāsān. Kābul is an excellent trading-centre;
if merchants went to Khīta or to Rūm,<a name="FNanchor_736" id="FNanchor_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736" class="fnanchor">736</a> they might make no
higher profit. Down to Kābul every year come 7, 8, or 10,000
horses and up to it, from Hindūstān, come every year caravans
of 10, 15 or 20,000 heads-of-houses, bringing slaves (<i>barda</i>), white
cloth, sugar-candy, refined and common sugars, and aromatic
roots. Many a trader is not content with a profit of 30 or 40
on 10.<a name="FNanchor_737" id="FNanchor_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737" class="fnanchor">737</a> In Kābul can be had the products of Khurāsān, Rūm,

<p class="indent">(<i>c. Products and climate of Kābul.</i>)</p>

<p>In the country of Kābul, there are hot and cold districts close
to one another. In one day, a man may go out of the town of
Kābul to where snow never falls, or he may go, in two sidereal
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;129b.</span>hours, to where it never thaws, unless when the heats are such
that it cannot possibly lie.</p>

<p>Fruits of hot and cold climates are to be had in the districts
near the town. Amongst those of the cold climate, there are
had in the town the grape, pomegranate, apricot, apple, quince,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>pear, peach, plum, <i>sinjid</i>, almond and walnut.<a name="FNanchor_738" id="FNanchor_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738" class="fnanchor">738</a> I had cuttings

reckoned good there; nor are its melons first-rate, but they are
not altogether bad when grown from Khurāsān seed.</p>

<p>It has a very pleasant climate; if the world has another so

<p class="indent">(<i>d. Meadows of Kābul.</i>)</p>

<p>There are good meadows on the four sides of Kābul. An
excellent one, Sūng-qūrghān, is some 4 miles (2 <i>kuroh</i>) to the
north-east; it has grass fit for horses and few mosquitos. To
the north-west is the Chālāk meadow, some 2 miles (1 <i>shar‘ī</i>)
away, a large one but in it mosquitos greatly trouble the horses.
On the west is the Dūrrīn, in fact there are two, Tīpa and Qūsh-nādir
(var. nāwar),&mdash;if two are counted here, there would be five
in all. Each of these is about 2 miles from the town; both are
small, have grass good for horses, and no mosquitos; Kābul has
no others so good. On the east is the Siyāh-sang meadow with
Qūtlūq-qadam’s tomb<a name="FNanchor_747" id="FNanchor_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747" class="fnanchor">747</a> between it and the Currier’s-gate; it is
not worth much because, in the heats, it swarms with mosquitos.
Kamarī<a name="FNanchor_748" id="FNanchor_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748" class="fnanchor">748</a> meadow adjoins it; counting this in, the meadows of
Kābul would be six, but they are always spoken of as four.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>e. Mountain-passes into Kābul.</i>)</p>

<p>The country of Kābul is a fastness hard for a foreign foe to
make his way into.</p>

<p>The Hindū-kush mountains, which separate Kābul from Balkh,
Qūndūz and Badakhshān, are crossed by seven roads.<a name="FNanchor_749" id="FNanchor_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749" class="fnanchor">749</a> Three
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>of these lead out of Panjhīr (Panj-sher), <i>viz.</i> Khawāk, the uppermost,
T̤ūl, the next lower, and Bāzārak.<a name="FNanchor_750" id="FNanchor_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750" class="fnanchor">750</a> Of the passes on them,
the one on the T̤ūl road is the best, but the road itself is rather<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;130b.</span>
the longest whence, seemingly, it is called T̤ūl. Bāzārak is the
most direct; like T̤ūl, it leads over into Sar-i-āb; as it passes
through Pārandī, local people call its main pass, the Pārandī.
Another road leads up through Parwān; it has seven minor
passes, known as Haft-bacha (Seven-younglings), between
Parwān and its main pass (Bāj-gāh). It is joined at its main
pass by two roads from Andar-āb, which go on to Parwān by
it. This is a road full of difficulties. Out of Ghūr-bund, again,
three roads lead over. The one next to Parwān, known as the
Yāngī-yūl pass (New-road), goes through Wālīān to Khinjan;
next above this is the Qīpchāq road, crossing to where the water
of Andar-āb meets the Sūrkh-āb (Qīzīl-sū); this also is an
excellent road; and the third leads over the Shibr-tū pass;<a name="FNanchor_751" id="FNanchor_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751" class="fnanchor">751</a>
those crossing by this in the heats take their way by Bāmīān
and Saighān, but those crossing by it in winter, go on by Āb-dara
(Water-valley).<a name="FNanchor_752" id="FNanchor_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752" class="fnanchor">752</a> Shibr-tū excepted, all the Hindū-kush roads
are closed for three or four months in winter,<a name="FNanchor_753" id="FNanchor_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753" class="fnanchor">753</a> because no road
through a valley-bottom is passable when the waters are high.
If any-one thinks to cross the Hindū-kush at that time, over the
mountains instead of through a valley-bottom, his journey is
hard indeed. The time to cross is during the three or four
autumn months when the snow is less and the waters are low.<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;131.</span>
Whether on the mountains or in the valley-bottoms, Kāfir highwaymen
are not few.</p>

<p>The road from Kābul into Khurāsān passes through Qandahār;
it is quite level, without a pass.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>
<p>Four roads lead into Kābul from the Hindūstān side; one by
rather a low pass through the Khaibar mountains, another by
way of Bangash, another by way of Naghr (var. Naghz),<a name="FNanchor_754" id="FNanchor_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754" class="fnanchor">754</a> and
another through Farmūl;<a name="FNanchor_755" id="FNanchor_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755" class="fnanchor">755</a> the passes being low also in the three
last-named. These roads are all reached from three ferries over
the Sind. Those who take the Nīl-āb<a name="FNanchor_756" id="FNanchor_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756" class="fnanchor">756</a> ferry, come on through
the Lamghānāt.<a name="FNanchor_757" id="FNanchor_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757" class="fnanchor">757</a> In winter, however, people ford the Sind-water
(at Hāru) above its junction with the Kābul-water,<a name="FNanchor_758" id="FNanchor_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758" class="fnanchor">758</a> and
ford this also. In most of my expeditions into Hindūstān,
I crossed those fords, but this last time (932 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH</span>.-1525 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD</span>.),
when I came, defeated Sl. Ibrāhīm and conquered the country,
I crossed by boat at Nīl-āb. Except at the one place mentioned
above, the Sind-water can be crossed only by boat. Those again,
who cross at Dīn-kot<a name="FNanchor_759" id="FNanchor_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759" class="fnanchor">759</a> go on through Bangash. Those crossing
at Chaupāra, if they take the Farmūl road, go on to Ghaznī,
or, if they go by the Dasht, go on to Qandahār.<a name="FNanchor_760" id="FNanchor_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760" class="fnanchor">760</a></p>

<p class="indent">(<i>f. Inhabitants of Kābul.</i>)</p>

<p>There are many differing tribes in the Kābul country; in its
dales and plains are Turks and clansmen<a name="FNanchor_761" id="FNanchor_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761" class="fnanchor">761</a> and ‘Arabs; in its
town and in many villages, Sārts; out in the districts and also<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;131b.</span>
in villages are the Pashāī, Parājī, Tājīk, Bīrkī and Afghān tribes.
In the western mountains are the Hazāra and Nikdīrī tribes,
some of whom speak the Mughūlī tongue. In the north-eastern
mountains are the places of the Kāfirs, such as Kitūr (Gawār?)
and Gibrik. To the south are the places of the Afghān tribes.</p>

<p>Eleven or twelve tongues are spoken in Kābul,&mdash;‘Arabī,
Persian, Turkī, Mughūlī, Hindī, Afghānī, Pashāī, Parājī, Gibrī,
Bīrkī and Lamghānī. If there be another country with so many
differing tribes and such a diversity of tongues, it is not known.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>e. Sub-divisions of the Kābul country.</i>)</p>

<p>The [Kābul] country has fourteen <i>tūmāns</i>.<a name="FNanchor_762" id="FNanchor_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762" class="fnanchor">762</a></p>

<p>Bajaur, Sawād and Hash-nagar may at one time have been
dependencies of Kābul, but they now have no resemblance to
cultivated countries (<i>wilāyāt</i>), some lying desolate because of
the Afghāns, others being now subject to them.</p>

<p>In the east of the country of Kābul is the Lamghānāt, 5 <i>tūmāns</i>
and 2 <i>bulūks</i> of cultivated lands.<a name="FNanchor_763" id="FNanchor_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763" class="fnanchor">763</a> The largest of these is
Nīngnahār, sometimes written Nagarahār in the histories.<a name="FNanchor_764" id="FNanchor_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764" class="fnanchor">764</a> Its
<i>dārogha’s</i> residence is in Adīnapūr,<a name="FNanchor_765" id="FNanchor_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765" class="fnanchor">765</a> some 13 <i>yīghāch</i> east of
Kābul by a very bad and tiresome road, going in three or four
places over small hill-passes, and in three or four others, through<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;132.</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>narrows.<a name="FNanchor_766" id="FNanchor_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_766" class="fnanchor">766</a> So long as there was no cultivation along it, the
Khirilchī and other Afghān thieves used to make it their beat,
but it has become safe<a name="FNanchor_767" id="FNanchor_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_767" class="fnanchor">767</a> since I had it peopled at Qarā-tū,<a name="FNanchor_768" id="FNanchor_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_768" class="fnanchor">768</a> below
Qūrūq-sāī. The hot and cold climates are separated on this
road by the pass of Bādām-chashma (Almond-spring); on its
Kābul side snow falls, none at Qūrūq-sāī, towards the Lamghānāt.<a name="FNanchor_769" id="FNanchor_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_769" class="fnanchor">769</a>
After descending this pass, another world comes into view, other
trees, other plants (or grasses), other animals, and other manners
and customs of men. Nīngnahār is nine torrents (<i>tūqūz-rūd</i>).<a name="FNanchor_770" id="FNanchor_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_770" class="fnanchor">770</a>
It grows good crops of rice and corn, excellent and abundant
oranges, citrons and pomegranates. In 914 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH</span>. (1508-9 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD</span>.)
I laid out the Four-gardens, known as the Bāgh-i-wafā (Garden-of-fidelity),
on a rising-ground, facing south and having the
Sūrkh-rūd between it and Fort Adīnapūr.<a name="FNanchor_771" id="FNanchor_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_771" class="fnanchor">771</a> There oranges, citrons
and pomegranates grow in abundance. The year I defeated
Pahār Khān and took Lāhor and Dipālpūr,<a name="FNanchor_772" id="FNanchor_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772" class="fnanchor">772</a> I had plantains
(bananas) brought and planted there; they did very well. The
year before I had had sugar-cane planted there; it also did well;
some of it was sent to Bukhārā and Badakhshān.<a name="FNanchor_773" id="FNanchor_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773" class="fnanchor">773</a> The garden
lies high, has running-water close at hand, and a mild winter
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;132b.</span>climate. In the middle of it, a one-mill stream flows constantly
past the little hill on which are the four garden-plots. In the
south-west part of it there is a reservoir, 10 by 10,<a name="FNanchor_774" id="FNanchor_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774" class="fnanchor">774</a> round which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>are orange-trees and a few pomegranates, the whole encircled by
a trefoil-meadow. This is the best part of the garden, a most
beautiful sight when the oranges take colour. Truly that garden
is admirably situated!</p>

<p>The Safed-koh runs along the south of Nīngnahār, dividing it
from Bangash; no riding-road crosses it; nine torrents (<i>tūqūz-rūd</i>)
issue from it.<a name="FNanchor_775" id="FNanchor_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775" class="fnanchor">775</a> It is called Safed-koh<a name="FNanchor_776" id="FNanchor_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_776" class="fnanchor">776</a> because its snow
never lessens; none falls in the lower parts of its valleys, a half-day’s
journey from the snow-line. Many places along it have
an excellent climate; its waters are cold and need no ice.</p>

<p>The Sūrkh-rūd flows along the south of Adīnapūr. The fort
stands on a height having a straight fall to the river of some
130 ft. (40-50 <i>qārī</i>) and isolated from the mountain behind it on
the north; it is very strongly placed. That mountain runs between
Nīngnahār and Lamghān<a name="FNanchor_777" id="FNanchor_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777" class="fnanchor">777</a>; on its head snow falls when it snows<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;133.</span>
in Kābul, so Lamghānīs know when it has snowed in the town.</p>

<p>In going from Kābul into the Lamghānāt,<a name="FNanchor_778" id="FNanchor_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_778" class="fnanchor">778</a>&mdash;if people come
by Qūrūq-sāī, one road goes on through the Dīrī-pass, crosses
the Bārān-water at Būlān, and so on into the Lamghānāt,&mdash;another
goes through Qarā-tū, below Qūrūq-sāī, crosses the
Bārān-water at Aūlūgh-nūr (Great-rock?), and goes into Lamghān
by the pass of Bād-i-pīch.<a name="FNanchor_779" id="FNanchor_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_779" class="fnanchor">779</a> If however people come by Nijr-aū,
they traverse Badr-aū (Tag-aū), and Qarā-nakariq (?), and go on
through the pass of Bād-i-pīch.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>
<p>Although Nīngnahār is one of the five <i>tūmāns</i> of the Lamghān
<i>tūmān</i> the name Lamghānāt applies strictly only to the three
(mentioned below).</p>

<p>One of the three is the ‘Alī-shang <i>tūmān</i>, to the north of
which are fastness-mountains, connecting with Hindū-kush and
inhabited by Kāfirs only. What of Kāfiristān lies nearest to
‘Alī-shang, is Mīl out of which its torrent issues. The tomb of
Lord Lām,<a name="FNanchor_780" id="FNanchor_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_780" class="fnanchor">780</a> father of his Reverence the prophet Nuḥ (Noah),
is in this <i>tūmān</i>. In some histories he is called Lamak and
Lamakān. Some people are observed often to change <i>kāf</i> for
<i>ghain</i> (<i>k</i> for <i>gh</i>); it would seem to be on this account that the
country is called Lamghān.</p>

<p>The second is Alangār. The part of Kāfiristān nearest to it
is Gawār (Kawār), out of which its torrent issues (the Gau or
Kau). This torrent joins that of ‘Alī-shang and flows with it
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;133b.</span>into the Bārān-water, below Mandrāwar, which is the third <i>tūmān</i>
of the Lamghānāt.</p>

<p>Of the two <i>bulūks</i> of Lamghān one is the Nūr-valley.<a name="FNanchor_781" id="FNanchor_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_781" class="fnanchor">781</a> This
is a place (<i>yīr</i>) without a second<a name="FNanchor_782" id="FNanchor_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_782" class="fnanchor">782</a>; its fort is on a beak (<i>tūmshūq</i>)
of rock in the mouth of the valley, and has a torrent on each
side; its rice is grown on steep terraces, and it can be traversed
by one road only.<a name="FNanchor_783" id="FNanchor_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_783" class="fnanchor">783</a> It has the orange, citron and other fruits of
hot climates in abundance, a few dates even. Trees cover the
banks of both the torrents below the fort; many are <i>amlūk</i>, the
fruit of which some Turks call <i>qarā-yīmīsh</i>;<a name="FNanchor_784" id="FNanchor_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_784" class="fnanchor">784</a> here they are
many, but none have been seen elsewhere. The valley grows
grapes also, all trained on trees.<a name="FNanchor_785" id="FNanchor_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785" class="fnanchor">785</a> Its wines are those of
Lamghān that have reputation. Two sorts of grapes are grown,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>the <i>arah-tāshī</i> and the <i>sūhān-tāshī</i>;<a name="FNanchor_786" id="FNanchor_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_786" class="fnanchor">786</a> the first are yellowish, the
second, full-red of fine colour. The first make the more cheering
wine, but it must be said that neither wine equals its reputation
for cheer. High up in one of its glens, apes (<i>maimūn</i>) are found,
none below. Those people (<i>i.e.</i> Nūrīs) used to keep swine but
they have given it up in our time.<a name="FNanchor_787" id="FNanchor_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787" class="fnanchor">787</a></p>

<p>Another <i>tūmān</i> of Lamghān is Kūnār-with-Nūr-gal. It lies
somewhat out-of-the-way, remote from the Lamghānāt, with its
borders in amongst the Kāfir lands; on these accounts its people
give in tribute rather little of what they have. The Chaghān-sarāī<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;134.</span>
water enters it from the north-east, passes on into the <i>bulūk</i>
of Kāma, there joins the Bārān-water and with that flows east.</p>

<p>Mīr Sayyid ‘Alī <i>Hamadānī</i>,<a name="FNanchor_788" id="FNanchor_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_788" class="fnanchor">788</a>&mdash;God’s mercy on him!&mdash;coming
here as he journeyed, died 2 miles (1 <i>shar‘ī</i>) above Kūnār. His
disciples carried his body to Khutlān. A shrine was erected at
the honoured place of his death, of which I made the circuit
when I came and took Chaghān-sarāī in 920 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH</span>.<a name="FNanchor_789" id="FNanchor_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_789" class="fnanchor">789</a></p>

<p>The orange, citron and coriander<a name="FNanchor_790" id="FNanchor_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_790" class="fnanchor">790</a> abound in this <i>tūmān</i>.
Strong wines are brought down into it from Kāfiristān.</p>

<p>A strange thing is told there, one seeming impossible, but
one told to us again and again. All through the hill-country
above Multa-kundī, <i>viz.</i> in Kūnār, Nūr-gal, Bajaur, Sawād and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>thereabouts, it is commonly said that when a woman dies and has
been laid on a bier, she, if she has not been an ill-doer, gives the
bearers such a shake when they lift the bier by its four sides,
that against their will and hindrance, her corpse falls to the
ground; but, if she has done ill, no movement occurs. This
was heard not only from Kūnārīs but, again and again, in Bajaur,
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;134b.</span>Sawād and the whole hill-tract. Ḥaidar-‘alī <i>Bajaurī</i>,&mdash;a sult̤ān
who governed Bajaur well,&mdash;when his mother died, did not weep,
or betake himself to lamentation, or put on black, but said, “Go!
lay her on the bier! if she move not, I will have her burned.”<a name="FNanchor_792" id="FNanchor_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_792" class="fnanchor">792</a>
They laid her on the bier; the desired movement followed;
when he heard that this was so, he put on black and betook
himself to lamentation.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(<i>Authors note to Multa-kundī.</i>) As Multa-kundī is known the lower part
of the <i>tūmān</i> of Kūnār-with-Nūr-gal; what is below (<i>i.e.</i> on the river)
belongs to the valley of Nūr and to Atar.<a name="FNanchor_791" id="FNanchor_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_791" class="fnanchor">791</a></p></div>

<p>Another <i>bulūk</i> is Chaghān-sarāī,<a name="FNanchor_793" id="FNanchor_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_793" class="fnanchor">793</a> a single village with little
land, in the mouth of Kāfiristān; its people, though Muṣalmān,
mix with the Kāfirs and, consequently, follow their customs.<a name="FNanchor_794" id="FNanchor_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_794" class="fnanchor">794</a>
A great torrent (the Kūnār) comes down to it from the north-east
from behind Bajaur, and a smaller one, called Pīch,
comes down out of Kāfiristān. Strong yellowish wines are had
there, not in any way resembling those of the Nūr-valley,
however. The village has no grapes or vineyards of its own;
its wines are all brought from up the Kāfiristān-water and from
Pīch-i-kāfiristānī.</p>

<p>The Pīch Kāfirs came to help the villagers when I took the
place. Wine is so commonly used there that every Kāfir has
his leathern wine-bag (<i>khīg</i>) at his neck, and drinks wine instead
of water.<a name="FNanchor_795" id="FNanchor_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_795" class="fnanchor">795</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>
<p>Kāma, again, though not a separate district but dependent on
Nīngnahār, is also called a <i>bulūk</i>.<a name="FNanchor_796" id="FNanchor_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796" class="fnanchor">796</a><span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;135.</span></p>

<p>Nijr-aū<a name="FNanchor_797" id="FNanchor_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797" class="fnanchor">797</a> is another <i>tūmān</i>. It lies north of Kābul, in the
Kohistān, with mountains behind it inhabited solely by Kāfirs;
it is a quite sequestered place. It grows grapes and fruits in
abundance. Its people make much wine but, they boil it.
They fatten many fowls in winter, are wine-bibbers, do not pray,
have no scruples and are Kāfir-like.<a name="FNanchor_798" id="FNanchor_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_798" class="fnanchor">798</a></p>

<p>In the Nijr-aū mountains is an abundance of <i>archa</i>, <i>jīlghūza</i>,
<i>bīlūt</i> and <i>khanjak</i>.<a name="FNanchor_799" id="FNanchor_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_799" class="fnanchor">799</a> The first-named three do not grow above
Nigr-aū but they grow lower, and are amongst the trees of
Hindūstān. <i>Jīlghūza</i>-wood is all the lamp the people have; it
burns like a candle and is very remarkable. The flying-squirrel<a name="FNanchor_800" id="FNanchor_800"></a><a href="#Footnote_800" class="fnanchor">800</a>
is found in these mountains, an animal larger than a bat and
having a curtain (<i>parda</i>), like a bat’s wing, between its arms and
legs. People often brought one in; it is said to fly, downward
from one tree to another, as far as a <i>giz</i> flies;<a name="FNanchor_801" id="FNanchor_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_801" class="fnanchor">801</a> I myself have
never seen one fly. Once we put one to a tree; it clambered
up directly and got away, but, when people went after it, it
spread its wings and came down, without hurt, as if it had flown.
Another of the curiosities of the Nijr-aū mountains is the <i>lūkha</i>
(var. <i>lūja</i>) bird, called also <i>bū-qalamūn</i> (chameleon) because,
between head and tail, it has four or five changing colours,
resplendent like a pigeon’s throat.<a name="FNanchor_802" id="FNanchor_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802" class="fnanchor">802</a> It is about as large as the</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p><i>kabg-i-darī</i> and seems to be the <i>kabg-i-darī</i> of Hindūstān.<a name="FNanchor_803" id="FNanchor_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803" class="fnanchor">803</a>
People tell this wonderful thing about it:&mdash;When the birds, at
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;135b.</span>the on-set of winter, descend to the hill-skirts, if they come over
a vineyard, they can fly no further and are taken.<a name="FNanchor_804" id="FNanchor_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_804" class="fnanchor">804</a> There is
a kind of rat in Nijr-aū, known as the musk-rat, which smells of
musk; I however have never seen it.<a name="FNanchor_805" id="FNanchor_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805" class="fnanchor">805</a></p>

<p>Panjhīr (Panj-sher) is another <i>tūmān</i>; it lies close to Kāfiristān,
along the Panjhīr road, and is the thoroughfare of Kāfir highwaymen
who also, being so near, take tax of it. They have gone
through it, killing a mass of persons, and doing very evil deeds,
since I came this last time and conquered Hindūstān (932 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH</span>.-1526
<span class="smcap lowercase">AD</span>.).<a name="FNanchor_806" id="FNanchor_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_806" class="fnanchor">806</a></p>

<p>Another is the <i>tūmān</i> of Ghūr-bund. In those countries they
call a <i>kūtal</i> (<i>koh</i>?) a <i>bund</i>;<a name="FNanchor_807" id="FNanchor_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_807" class="fnanchor">807</a> they go towards Ghūr by this pass
(<i>kūtal</i>); apparently it is for this reason that they have called (the
<i>tūmān</i>?) Ghūr-bund. The Hazāra hold the heads of its valleys.<a name="FNanchor_808" id="FNanchor_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808" class="fnanchor">808</a>
It has few villages and little revenue can be raised from it. There
are said to be mines of silver and lapis lazuli in its mountains.</p>

<p>Again, there are the villages on the skirts of the (Hindū-kush)
mountains,<a name="FNanchor_809" id="FNanchor_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809" class="fnanchor">809</a> with Mīta-kacha and Parwān at their head, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>Dūr-nāma<a name="FNanchor_810" id="FNanchor_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810" class="fnanchor">810</a> at their foot, 12 or 13 in all. They are fruit-bearing
villages, and they grow cheering wines, those of Khwāja Khāwand
Sa‘īd being reputed the strongest roundabouts. The villages all
lie on the foot-hills; some pay taxes but not all are taxable
because they lie so far back in the mountains.</p>

<p>Between the foot-hills and the Bārān-water are two detached
stretches of level land, one known as <i>Kurrat-tāziyān</i>,<a name="FNanchor_811" id="FNanchor_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811" class="fnanchor">811</a> the other
as <i>Dasht-i-shaikh</i> (Shaikh’s-plain). As the green grass of the
millet<a name="FNanchor_812" id="FNanchor_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812" class="fnanchor">812</a> grows well there, they are the resort of Turks and<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;136.</span>
(Mughūl) clans (<i>aīmāq</i>).</p>

<p>Tulips of many colours cover these foot-hills; I once counted
them up; it came out at 32 or 33 different sorts. We named
one the Rose-scented, because its perfume was a little like that
of the red rose; it grows by itself on Shaikh’s-plain, here and
nowhere else. The Hundred-leaved tulip is another; this grows,
also by itself, at the outlet of the Ghūr-bund narrows, on the
hill-skirt below Parwān. A low hill known as Khwāja Reg-i-rawān
(Khwāja-of-the-running-sand), divides the afore-named
two pieces of level land; it has, from top to foot, a strip of sand
from which people say the sound of nagarets and tambours
issues in the heats.<a name="FNanchor_813" id="FNanchor_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813" class="fnanchor">813</a></p>

<p>Again, there are the villages depending on Kābul itself.
South-west from the town are great snow mountains<a name="FNanchor_814" id="FNanchor_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814" class="fnanchor">814</a> where snow
falls on snow, and where few may be the years when, falling, it
does not light on last year’s snow. It is fetched, 12 miles
may-be, from these mountains, to cool the drinking water when
ice-houses in Kābul are empty. Like the Bāmiān mountains,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>these are fastnesses. Out of them issue the Harmand (Halmand),
Sind, Dūghāba of Qūndūz, and Balkh-āb,<a name="FNanchor_815" id="FNanchor_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815" class="fnanchor">815</a> so that in a single
day, a man might drink of the water of each of these four rivers.</p>

<p>It is on the skirt of one of these ranges (Pamghān) that most
of the villages dependent on Kābul lie.<a name="FNanchor_816" id="FNanchor_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_816" class="fnanchor">816</a> Masses of grapes ripen
in their vineyards and they grow every sort of fruit in abundance.
No-one of them equals Istālīf or Astarghach; these must be the
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;136b.</span>two which Aūlūgh Beg Mīrzā used to call his Khurāsān and
Samarkand. Pamghān is another of the best, not ranking in
fruit and grapes with those two others, but beyond comparison
with them in climate. The Pamghān mountains are a snowy
range. Few villages match Istālīf, with vineyards and fine
orchards on both sides of its great torrent, with waters needing
no ice, cold and, mostly, pure. Of its Great garden Aūlūgh
Beg Mīrzā had taken forcible possession; I took it over, after
paying its price to the owners. There is a pleasant halting-place
outside it, under great planes, green, shady and beautiful. A one-mill
stream, having trees on both banks, flows constantly through
the middle of the garden; formerly its course was zig-zag and
irregular; I had it made straight and orderly; so the place
became very beautiful. Between the village and the valley-bottom,
from 4 to 6 miles down the slope, is a spring, known as
Khwāja Sih-yārān (Three-friends), round which three sorts of tree
grow. A group of planes gives pleasant shade above it; holm-oak
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;137.</span>(<i>quercus bīlūt</i>) grows in masses on the slope at its sides,&mdash;these
two oaklands (<i>bīlūtistān</i>) excepted, no holm-oak grows in
the mountains of western Kābul,&mdash;and the Judas-tree (<i>arghwān</i>)<a name="FNanchor_817" id="FNanchor_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817" class="fnanchor">817</a>
is much cultivated in front of it, that is towards the level ground,&mdash;cultivated
there and nowhere else. People say the three
different sorts of tree were a gift made by three saints,<a name="FNanchor_818" id="FNanchor_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_818" class="fnanchor">818</a> whence
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>its name. I ordered that the spring should be enclosed in
mortared stone-work, 10 by 10, and that a symmetrical, right-angled
platform should be built on each of its sides, so as to
overlook the whole field of Judas-trees. If, the world over, there
is a place to match this when the <i>arghwāns</i> are in full bloom,
I do not know it. The yellow <i>arghwān</i> grows plentifully there
also, the red and the yellow flowering at the same time.<a name="FNanchor_819" id="FNanchor_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_819" class="fnanchor">819</a></p>

<p>In order to bring water to a large round seat which I had built
on the hillside and planted round with willows, I had a channel
dug across the slope from a half-mill stream, constantly flowing
in a valley to the south-west of Sih-yārān. The date of cutting
this channel was found in <i>jūī-khūsh</i> (kindly channel).<a name="FNanchor_820" id="FNanchor_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_820" class="fnanchor">820</a></p>

<p>Another of the <i>tūmāns</i> of Kābul is Luhūgur (mod. Logar).
Its one large village is Chīrkh from which were his Reverence
Maulānā Ya‘qūb and Mullā-zāda ‘Us̤mān.<a name="FNanchor_821" id="FNanchor_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_821" class="fnanchor">821</a> Khwāja Aḥmad<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;137b.</span>
and Khwāja Yūnas were from Sajāwand, another of its villages.
Chīrkh has many gardens, but there are none in any other village
of Luhūgur. Its people are Aūghān-shāl, a term common in
Kābul, seeming to be a mispronouncement of Aūghān-sha‘ār.<a name="FNanchor_822" id="FNanchor_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_822" class="fnanchor">822</a></p>

<p>Again, there is the <i>wilāyat</i>, or, as some say, <i>tūmān</i> of Ghaznī,
said to have been<a name="FNanchor_823" id="FNanchor_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_823" class="fnanchor">823</a> the capital of Sabuk-tīgīn, Sl. Maḥmūd and
their descendants. Many write it Ghaznīn. It is said also to
have been the seat of government of Shihābu’d-dīn <i>Ghūrī</i>,<a name="FNanchor_824" id="FNanchor_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_824" class="fnanchor">824</a> styled
Mu‘iz̤z̤u’d-dīn in the <i>T̤abaqāt-i-nāṣirī</i> and also some of the
histories of Hind.</p>

<p>Ghaznī is known also as <i>Zābulistān</i>; it belongs to the Third
climate. Some hold that Qandahār is a part of it. It lies
14 <i>yīghāch</i> (south-) west of Kābul; those leaving it at dawn,
may reach Kābul between the Two Prayers (<i>i.e.</i> in the afternoon);
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>whereas the 13 <i>yīghāch</i> between Adīnapūr and Kābul can never
be done in one day, because of the difficulties of the road.</p>

<p>Ghaznī has little cultivated land. Its torrent, a four-mill or
five-mill stream may-be, makes the town habitable and fertilizes
four or five villages; three or four others are cultivated from
under-ground water-courses (<i>kārez</i>). Ghaznī grapes are better
than those of Kābul; its melons are more abundant; its apples
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;138.</span>are very good, and are carried to Hindūstān. Agriculture is
very laborious in Ghaznī because, whatever the quality of the soil,
it must be newly top-dressed every year; it gives a better return,
however, than Kābul. Ghaznī grows madder; the entire crop
goes to Hindūstān and yields excellent profit to the growers.
In the open-country of Ghaznī dwell Hazāra and Afghāns.
Compared with Kābul, it is always a cheap place. Its people
hold to the Ḥanafī faith, are good, orthodox Muṣalmāns, many
keep a three months’ fast,<a name="FNanchor_825" id="FNanchor_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_825" class="fnanchor">825</a> and their wives and children live
modestly secluded.</p>

<p>One of the eminent men of Ghaznī was Mullā ‘Abdu’r-raḥmān,
a learned man and always a learner (<i>dars</i>), a most orthodox,
pious and virtuous person; he left this world the same year as
Nāṣir Mīrzā (921 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1515 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>). Sl. Maḥmūd’s tomb is in the
suburb called Rauẓa,<a name="FNanchor_826" id="FNanchor_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_826" class="fnanchor">826</a> from which the best grapes come; there also
are the tombs of his descendants, Sl. Mas‘ūd and Sl. Ibrāhīm.
Ghaznī has many blessed tombs. The year<a name="FNanchor_827" id="FNanchor_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_827" class="fnanchor">827</a> I took Kābul and
Ghaznī, over-ran Kohāt, the plain of Bannū and lands of the
Afghāns, and went on to Ghaznī by way of Dūkī (Dūgī) and
Āb-istāda, people told me there was a tomb, in a village of
Ghaznī, which moved when a benediction on the Prophet was
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;138b.</span>pronounced over it. We went to see it. In the end I discovered
that the movement was a trick, presumably of the servants at
the tomb, who had put a sort of platform above it which moved
when pushed, so that, to those on it, the tomb seemed to move,
just as the shore does to those passing in a boat. I ordered the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>scaffold destroyed and a dome built over the tomb; also I forbad
the servants, with threats, ever to bring about the movement again.</p>

<p>Ghaznī is a very humble place; strange indeed it is that rulers
in whose hands were Hindūstān and Khurāsānāt,<a name="FNanchor_828" id="FNanchor_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_828" class="fnanchor">828</a> should have
chosen it for their capital. In the Sult̤ān’s (Maḥmūd’s) time
there may have been three or four dams in the country; one he
made, some three <i>yīghāch</i> (18 m.?) up the Ghaznī-water to the
north; it was about 40-50 <i>qārī</i> (yards) high and some 300 long;
through it the stored waters were let out as required.<a name="FNanchor_829" id="FNanchor_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_829" class="fnanchor">829</a> It was
destroyed by ‘Alāu’u’d-dīn <i>Jahān-soz Ghūrī</i> when he conquered
the country (550 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1152 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>), burned and ruined the tombs
of several descendants of Sl. Maḥmūd, sacked and burned the
town, in short, left undone no tittle of murder and rapine. Since<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;139.</span>
that time, the Sult̤ān’s dam has lain in ruins, but, through God’s
favour, there is hope that it may become of use again, by means
of the money which was sent, in Khwāja Kalān’s hand, in the year
Hindūstān was conquered (932 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1526 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>).<a name="FNanchor_830" id="FNanchor_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_830" class="fnanchor">830</a> The Sakhandam
is another, 2 or 3 <i>yīghāch</i> (12-18 m.), may-be, on the east
of the town; it has long been in ruins, indeed is past repair.
There is a dam in working order at Sar-i-dih (Village-head).</p>

<p>In books it is written that there is in Ghaznī a spring such
that, if dirt and foul matter be thrown into it, a tempest gets up
instantly, with a blizzard of rain and wind. It has been seen said
also in one of the histories that Sabuk-tīgīn, when besieged by
the Rāī (Jāī-pāl) of Hind, ordered dirt and foulness to be thrown
into the spring, by this aroused, in an instant, a tempest with
blizzard of rain and snow, and, by this device, drove off his foe.<a name="FNanchor_831" id="FNanchor_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_831" class="fnanchor">831</a>
Though we made many enquiries, no intimation of the spring’s
existence was given us.</p>

<p>In these countries Ghaznī and Khwārizm are noted for cold,
in the same way that Sult̤ānīā and Tabrīz are in the two ‘Irāqs
and Aẕarbāījān.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<p>Zurmut is another <i>tūmān</i>, some 12-13 <i>yīghāch</i> south of Kābul
and 7-8 south-east of Ghaznī.<a name="FNanchor_832" id="FNanchor_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_832" class="fnanchor">832</a> Its <i>dārogha’s</i> head-quarters are
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;139b.</span>in Gīrdīz; there most houses are three or four storeys high. It
does not want for strength, and gave Nāṣir Mīrzā trouble when
it went into hostility to him. Its people are Aūghān-shāl; they
grow corn but have neither vineyards nor orchards. The tomb
of Shaikh Muḥammad <i>Muṣalmān</i> is at a spring, high on the
skirt of a mountain, known as Barakistān, in the south of the
<i>tūmān</i>.</p>

<p>Farmūl is another <i>tūmān</i>,<a name="FNanchor_833" id="FNanchor_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_833" class="fnanchor">833</a> a humble place, growing not bad
apples which are carried into Hindūstān. Of Farmūl were the
Shaikh-zādas, descendants of Shaikh Muḥammad <i>Muṣalmān</i>, who
were so much in favour during the Afghān period in Hindūstān.</p>

<p>Bangash is another <i>tūmān</i>.<a name="FNanchor_834" id="FNanchor_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_834" class="fnanchor">834</a> All round about it are Afghān
highwaymen, such as the Khūgīānī, Khirilchī, Tūrī and Landar.
Lying out-of-the-way, as it does, its people do not pay taxes
willingly. There has been no time to bring it to obedience;
greater tasks have fallen to me,&mdash;the conquests of Qandahār,
Balkh, Badakhshān and Hindūstān! But, God willing! when
I get the chance, I most assuredly will take order with those
Bangash thieves.</p>

<p>One of the <i>bulūks</i> of Kābul is Ālā-sāī,<a name="FNanchor_835" id="FNanchor_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_835" class="fnanchor">835</a> 4 to 6 miles
(2-3 <i>shar‘ī</i>) east of Nijr-aū. The direct road into it from
Nijr-aū leads, at a place called Kūra, through the quite small
pass which in that locality separates the hot and cold climates.
Through this pass the birds migrate at the change of the seasons,
and at those times many are taken by the people of Pīchghān,
one of the dependencies of Nijr-aū, in the following manner:&mdash;From
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;140.</span>distance to distance near the mouth of the pass, they make
hiding-places for the bird-catchers. They fasten one corner of
a net five or six yards away, and weight the lower side to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>ground with stones. Along the other side of the net, for half its
width, they fasten a stick some 3 to 4 yards long. The hidden
bird-catcher holds this stick and by it, when the birds approach,
lifts up the net to its full height. The birds then go into the net of
themselves. Sometimes so many are taken by this contrivance
that there is not time to cut their throats.<a name="FNanchor_836" id="FNanchor_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_836" class="fnanchor">836</a></p>

<p>Though the Ālā-sāī pomegranates are not first-rate, they have
local reputation because none are better there-abouts; they are
carried into Hindūstān. Grapes also do not grow badly, and
the wines of Ālā-sāī are better and stronger than those of
Nijr-aū.</p>

<p>Badr-aū (Tag-aū) is another <i>bulūk</i>; it runs with Ālā-sāī, grows
no fruit, and for cultivators has corn-growing Kāfirs.<a name="FNanchor_837" id="FNanchor_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_837" class="fnanchor">837</a></p>

<p class="indent">(<i>f. Tribesmen of Kābul.</i>)</p>

<p>Just as Turks and (Mughūl) clans (<i>aīmāq</i>) dwell in the open
country of Khurāsān and Samarkand, so in Kābul do the
Hazāra and Afghāns. Of the Hazāra, the most widely-scattered
are the Sult̤ān-mas‘ūdi Hazāra, of Afghāns, the Mahmand.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>g. Revenue of Kābul.</i>)</p>

<p>The revenues of Kābul, whether from the cultivated lands
or from tolls (<i>tamghā</i>) or from dwellers in the open country,
amount to 8 <i>laks</i> of <i>shāhrukhīs</i>.<a name="FNanchor_838" id="FNanchor_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_838" class="fnanchor">838</a><span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;140b.</span></p>

<p class="indent">(<i>h. The mountain-tracts of Kābul.</i>)</p>

<p>Where the mountains of Andar-āb, Khwāst,<a name="FNanchor_839" id="FNanchor_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_839" class="fnanchor">839</a> and the Badakh-shānāt
have conifers (<i>archa</i>), many springs and gentle slopes,
those of eastern Kābul have grass (<i>aūt</i>), grass like a beautiful
floor, on hill, slope and dale. For the most part it is <i>būta-kāh</i>
grass (<i>aūt</i>), very suitable for horses. In the Andijān country
they talk of <i>būta-kāh</i>, but why they do so was not known (to
me?); in Kābul it was heard-say to be because the grass comes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>up in tufts (<i>būta, būta</i>).<a name="FNanchor_840" id="FNanchor_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_840" class="fnanchor">840</a> The alps of these mountains are like
those of Ḥiṣār, Khutlān, Farghāna, Samarkand and Mughūlistān,&mdash;all
these being alike in mountain and alp, though the
alps of Farghāna and Mughūlistān are beyond comparison with
the rest.</p>

<p>From all these the mountains of Nijr-aū, the Lamghānāt and
Sawād differ in having masses of cypresses,<a name="FNanchor_841" id="FNanchor_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_841" class="fnanchor">841</a> holm-oak, olive and
mastic (<i>khanjak</i>); their grass also is different,&mdash;it is dense, it is
tall, it is good neither for horse nor sheep. Although these
mountains are not so high as those already described, indeed
they look to be low, none-the-less, they are strongholds; what
to the eye is even slope, really is hard rock on which it is
impossible to ride. Many of the beasts and birds of Hindūstān
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;141.</span>are found amongst them, such as the parrot, <i>mīna</i>, peacock and
<i>lūja</i> (<i>lūkha</i>), the ape, <i>nīl-gāu</i> and hog-deer (<i>kūta-pāī</i>);<a name="FNanchor_842" id="FNanchor_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_842" class="fnanchor">842</a> some
found there are not found even in Hindūstān.</p>

<p>The mountains to the west of Kābul are also all of one sort,
those of the Zindān-valley, the Ṣūf-valley, Garzawān and Gharjistān
(Gharchastān).<a name="FNanchor_843" id="FNanchor_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_843" class="fnanchor">843</a> Their meadows are mostly in the dales;
they have not the same sweep of grass on slope and top as some
of those described have; nor have they masses of trees; they
have, however, grass suiting horses. On their flat tops, where
all the crops are grown, there is ground where a horse can gallop.
They have masses of <i>kīyik</i>.<a name="FNanchor_844" id="FNanchor_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_844" class="fnanchor">844</a> Their valley-bottoms are strongholds,
mostly precipitous and inaccessible from above. It is
remarkable that, whereas other mountains have their fastnesses
in their high places, these have theirs below.</p>

<p>Of one sort again are the mountains of Ghūr, Karnūd (var.
Kuzūd) and Hazāra; their meadows are in their dales; their
trees are few, not even the <i>archa</i> being there;<a name="FNanchor_845" id="FNanchor_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_845" class="fnanchor">845</a> their grass is fit
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>for horses and for the masses of sheep they keep. They differ
from those last described in this, their strong places are not below.</p>

<p>The mountains (south-east of Kābul) of Khwāja Ismā‘īl, Dasht,
Dūgī (Dūkī)<a name="FNanchor_846" id="FNanchor_846"></a><a href="#Footnote_846" class="fnanchor">846</a> and Afghānistān are all alike; all low, scant of
vegetation, short of water, treeless, ugly and good-for-nothing.
Their people take after them, just as has been said, <i>Tīng būlmā-ghūncha</i><span class="sidenote">Fol 141b.</span>
<i>tūsh būlmās</i>.<a name="FNanchor_847" id="FNanchor_847"></a><a href="#Footnote_847" class="fnanchor">847</a> Likely enough the world has few mountains
so useless and disgusting.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>h. Fire-wood of Kabul.</i>)</p>

<p>The snow-fall being so heavy in Kābul, it is fortunate that
excellent fire-wood is had near by. Given one day to fetch it,
wood can be had of the <i>khanjak</i> (mastic), <i>bīlūt</i> (holm-oak),
<i>bādāmcha</i> (small-almond) and <i>qarqand</i>.<a name="FNanchor_848" id="FNanchor_848"></a><a href="#Footnote_848" class="fnanchor">848</a> Of these <i>khanjak</i> wood
is the best; it burns with flame and nice smell, makes plenty of
hot ashes and does well even if sappy. Holm-oak is also first-rate
fire-wood, blazing less than mastic but, like it, making
a hot fire with plenty of hot ashes, and nice smell. It has the
peculiarity in burning that when its leafy branches are set alight,
they fire up with amazing sound, blazing and crackling from
bottom to top. It is good fun to burn it. The wood of the
small-almond is the most plentiful and commonly-used, but it
does not make a lasting fire. The <i>qarqand</i> is quite a low shrub,
thorny, and burning sappy or dry; it is the fuel of the Ghaznī
people.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>i. Fauna of Kābul.</i>)</p>

<p>The cultivated lands of Kābul lie between mountains which

<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;142.</span>Towards Khūrd-kābul and the Sūrkh-rūd there is wild-ass, but

<p>In the heats the fowling-grounds of Kābul are crowded. The
birds take their way along the Bārān-water. For why? It is
because the river has mountains along it, east and west, and a
great Hindū-kush pass in a line with it, by which the birds must
cross since there is no other near.<a name="FNanchor_855" id="FNanchor_855"></a><a href="#Footnote_855" class="fnanchor">855</a> They cannot cross when the
north wind blows, or if there is even a little cloud on Hindū-kush;
at such times they alight on the level lands of the Bārān-water
and are taken in great numbers by the local people. Towards the
end of winter, dense flocks of mallards (<i>aūrdūq</i>) reach the banks
of the Bārān in very good condition. Follow these the cranes and
herons,<a name="FNanchor_856" id="FNanchor_856"></a><a href="#Footnote_856" class="fnanchor">856</a> great birds, in large flocks and countless numbers.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>j. Bird-catching.</i>)</p>

<p>Along the Bārān people take masses of cranes (<i>tūrna</i>) with
the cord; masses of <i>aūqār</i>, <i>qarqara</i> and <i>qūt̤ān</i> also.<a name="FNanchor_857" id="FNanchor_857"></a><a href="#Footnote_857" class="fnanchor">857</a> This
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>method of bird-catching is unique. They twist a cord as long
as the arrow’s<a name="FNanchor_858" id="FNanchor_858"></a><a href="#Footnote_858" class="fnanchor">858</a> flight, tie the arrow at one end and a <i>bīldūrga</i><a name="FNanchor_859" id="FNanchor_859"></a><a href="#Footnote_859" class="fnanchor">859</a>
at the other, and wind it up, from the arrow-end, on a piece of
wood, span-long and wrist-thick, right up to the <i>bīldūrga</i>. They<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;142b.</span>
then pull out the piece of wood, leaving just the hole it was in.
The <i>bīldūrga</i> being held fast in the hand, the arrow is shot off<a name="FNanchor_860" id="FNanchor_860"></a><a href="#Footnote_860" class="fnanchor">860</a>
towards the coming flock. If the cord twists round a neck or
wing, it brings the bird down. On the Bārān everyone takes
birds in this way; it is difficult; it must be done on rainy nights,
because on such nights the birds do not alight, but fly continually
and fly low till dawn, in fear of ravening beasts of prey. Through
the night the flowing river is their road, its moving water showing
through the dark; then it is, while they come and go, up and down
the river, that the cord is shot. One night I shot it; it broke in
drawing in; both bird and cord were brought in to me next day.
By this device Bārān people catch the many herons from which they
take the turban-aigrettes sent from Kābul for sale in Khurāsān.</p>

<p>Of bird-catchers there is also the band of slave-fowlers, two or
three hundred households, whom some descendant of Tīmūr Beg
made migrate from near Multān to the Bārān.<a name="FNanchor_861" id="FNanchor_861"></a><a href="#Footnote_861" class="fnanchor">861</a> Bird-catching<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;143.</span>
is their trade; they dig tanks, set decoy-birds<a name="FNanchor_862" id="FNanchor_862"></a><a href="#Footnote_862" class="fnanchor">862</a> on them, put a net
over the middle, and in this way take all sorts of birds. Not fowlers
only catch birds, but every dweller on the Bārān does it, whether
by shooting the cord, setting the springe, or in various other ways.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>k. Fishing.</i>)</p>

<p>The fish of the Bārān migrate at the same seasons as birds.
At those times many are netted, and many are taken on wattles
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>(<i>chīgh</i>) fixed in the water. In autumn when the plant known
as <i>wild-ass-tail</i><a name="FNanchor_863" id="FNanchor_863"></a><a href="#Footnote_863" class="fnanchor">863</a> has come to maturity, flowered and seeded,
people take 10-20 loads (of seed?) and 20-30 of green branches
(<i>gūk-shībāk</i>) to some head of water, break it up small and
cast it in. Then going into the water, they can at once pick up
drugged fish. At some convenient place lower down, in a hole
below a fall, they will have fixed before-hand a wattle of
finger-thick willow-withes, making it firm by piling stones on its
sides. The water goes rushing and dashing through the wattle,
but leaves on it any fish that may have come floating down.
This way of catching fish is practised in Gul-bahār, Parwān and
Istālīf.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;143b.</span>Fish are had in winter in the Lamghānāt by this curious
device:&mdash;People dig a pit to the depth of a house, in the bed of
a stream, below a fall, line it with stones like a cooking-place,
and build up stones round it above, leaving one opening only,
under water. Except by this one opening, the fish have no
inlet or outlet, but the water finds its way through the stones.
This makes a sort of fish-pond from which, when wanted in
winter, fish can be taken, 30-40 together. Except at the opening,
left where convenient, the sides of the fish-pond are made fast
with rice-straw, kept in place by stones. A piece of wicker-work
is pulled into the said opening by its edges, gathered together,
and into this a second piece, (a tube,) is inserted, fitting it at the
mouth but reaching half-way into it only.<a name="FNanchor_864" id="FNanchor_864"></a><a href="#Footnote_864" class="fnanchor">864</a> The fish go through
the smaller piece into the larger one, out from which they cannot
get. The second narrows towards its inner mouth, its pointed
ends being drawn so close that the fish, once entered, cannot
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;144.</span>turn, but must go on, one by one, into the larger piece. Out of
that they cannot return because of the pointed ends of the inner,
narrow mouth. The wicker-work fixed and the rice-straw making
the pond fast, whatever fish are inside can be taken out;<a name="FNanchor_865" id="FNanchor_865"></a><a href="#Footnote_865" class="fnanchor">865</a> any
also which, trying to escape may have gone into the wicker-work,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>are taken in it, because they have no way out. This method
of catching fish we have seen nowhere else.<a name="FNanchor_866" id="FNanchor_866"></a><a href="#Footnote_866" class="fnanchor">866</a></p>

<p class="indent">(<i>b. A levy in grain.</i>)</p>

<p>Many clans and hordes had come from Samarkand, Ḥiṣār
and Qūndūz into the Kābul-country. Kābul is a small country;
it is also of the sword, not of the pen;<a name="FNanchor_871" id="FNanchor_871"></a><a href="#Footnote_871" class="fnanchor">871</a> to take in money from
it for all these tribesmen was impossible. It therefore seemed
advisable to take in grain, provision for the families of these
clans so that their men could ride on forays with the army.
Accordingly it was decided to levy 30,000 ass-loads<a name="FNanchor_872" id="FNanchor_872"></a><a href="#Footnote_872" class="fnanchor">872</a> of grain
on Kābul, Ghaznī and their dependencies; we knew nothing
at that time about the harvests and incomings; the impost was
excessive, and under it the country suffered very grievously.</p>

<p>In those days I devised the Bāburī script.<a name="FNanchor_873" id="FNanchor_873"></a><a href="#Footnote_873" class="fnanchor">873</a></p>

would not give their goods. As these same tribesmen had
before that come down on the Ghaznī and Gīrdīz roads, we got
to horse, meaning to take them by surprise. Riding by the
Maidān-road, we crossed the Nirkh-pass<a name="FNanchor_875" id="FNanchor_875"></a><a href="#Footnote_875" class="fnanchor">875</a> by night and at the

<p class="indent">(<i>d. Bābur’s first start for Hindūstān.</i>)</p>

<p>When, a few days later, the army had been mustered, persons
acquainted with the country were summoned and questioned
about its every side and quarter. Some advised a march to the
Plain (Dasht);<a name="FNanchor_878" id="FNanchor_878"></a><a href="#Footnote_878" class="fnanchor">878</a> some approved of Bangash; some wished to
go into Hindūstān. The discussion found settlement in a move
on Hindūstān.</p>

<p>It was in the month of Sha‘bān (910 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-Jan. 1505 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>), the
Sun being in Aquarius, that we rode out of Kābul for Hindūstān.
We took the road by Bādām-chashma and Jagdālīk and reached
Adīnapūr in six marches. Till that time I had never seen
a hot country or the Hindūstān border-land. In Nīngnahār<a name="FNanchor_879" id="FNanchor_879"></a><a href="#Footnote_879" class="fnanchor">879</a>
another world came to view,&mdash;other grasses, other trees, other
animals, other birds, and other manners and customs of clan and
horde. We were amazed, and truly there was ground for amaze.<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;145b.</span></p>

<p>Nāṣir Mīrzā, who had gone earlier to his district, waited on
me in Adīnapūr. We made some delay in Adīnapūr in order
to let the men from behind join us, also a contingent from the
clans which had come with us into Kābul and were wintering
in the Lamghānāt.<a name="FNanchor_880" id="FNanchor_880"></a><a href="#Footnote_880" class="fnanchor">880</a> All having joined us, we marched to below

asked for leave to stay behind, saying he would follow in a few
days after making some sort of provision for his dependants

at Hot-spring (Garm-chashma), a head-man of the
Gāgīānī was brought in, a <i>Fajjī</i><a name="FNanchor_882" id="FNanchor_882"></a><a href="#Footnote_882" class="fnanchor">882</a> presumably with his caravan.
We took him with us to point out the roads. Crossing Khaibar
in a march or two, we dismounted at Jām.<a name="FNanchor_883" id="FNanchor_883"></a><a href="#Footnote_883" class="fnanchor">883</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>
<p>Tales had been told us about Gūr-khattrī;<a name="FNanchor_884" id="FNanchor_884"></a><a href="#Footnote_884" class="fnanchor">884</a> it was said to be
a holy place of the Jogīs and Hindūs who come from long
distances to shave their heads and beards there. I rode out at
once from Jām to visit Bīgrām,<a name="FNanchor_885" id="FNanchor_885"></a><a href="#Footnote_885" class="fnanchor">885</a> saw its great tree,<a name="FNanchor_886" id="FNanchor_886"></a><a href="#Footnote_886" class="fnanchor">886</a> and all the

our guide, one Malik Bū-sa‘īd <i>Kamarī</i>,<a name="FNanchor_887" id="FNanchor_887"></a><a href="#Footnote_887" class="fnanchor">887</a> would say nothing
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;146.</span>about it. When we were almost back in camp, however, he told
Khwāja Muḥammad-amīn that it was in Bīgrām and that he
had said nothing about it because of its confined cells and
narrow passages. The Khwāja, having there and then abused
him, repeated to us what he had said, but we could not go back
because the road was long and the day far spent.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>e. Move against Kohāt.</i>)</p>

<p>Whether to cross the water of Sind, or where else to go, was
discussed in that camp.<a name="FNanchor_888" id="FNanchor_888"></a><a href="#Footnote_888" class="fnanchor">888</a> Bāqī <i>Chaghānīānī</i> represented that it
seemed we might go, without crossing the river and with one
night’s halt, to a place called Kohāt where were many rich
tribesmen; moreover he brought Kābulīs forward who represented
the matter just as he had done. We had never heard of
the place, but, as he, my man in great authority, saw it good to
go to Kohāt and had brought forward support of his recommendation,&mdash;this
being so! we broke up our plan of crossing
the Sind-water into Hindūstān, marched from Jām, forded the
Bāra-water, and dismounted not far from the pass (<i>dābān</i>)
through the Muḥammad-mountain (<i>fajj</i>). At the time the
Gāgīānī Afghāns were located in Parashawār but, in dread of
our army, had drawn off to the skirt-hills. One of their headmen,
coming into this camp, did me obeisance; we took him, as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>well as the Fajjī, with us, so that, between them, they might<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;146b.</span>
point out the roads. We left that camp at midnight, crossed
Muḥammad-fajj at day-rise<a name="FNanchor_889" id="FNanchor_889"></a><a href="#Footnote_889" class="fnanchor">889</a> and by breakfast-time descended
on Kohāt. Much cattle and buffalo fell to our men; many
Afghāns were taken but I had them all collected and set them
free. In the Kohāt houses corn was found without limit. Our
foragers raided as far as the Sind-river (<i>daryā</i>), rejoining us after
one night’s halt. As what Bāqī <i>Chaghānīānī</i> had led us to expect
did not come to hand, he grew rather ashamed of his scheme.</p>

<p>When our foragers were back and after two nights in Kohāt,
we took counsel together as to what would be our next good move,
and we decided to over-run the Afghāns of Bangash and the
Bannū neighbourhood, then to go back to Kābul, either through
Naghr (Bāghzān?), or by the Farmūl-road (Tochī-valley?).</p>

<p>In Kohāt, Daryā Khān’s son, Yār-i-ḥusain, who had waited
on me in Kābul made petition, saying, “If royal orders were
given me for the Dilazāk,<a name="FNanchor_890" id="FNanchor_890"></a><a href="#Footnote_890" class="fnanchor">890</a> the Yūsuf-zāī, and the Gāgīānī, these
would not go far from my orders if I called up the Pādshāh’s
swords on the other side of the water of Sind.”<a name="FNanchor_891" id="FNanchor_891"></a><a href="#Footnote_891" class="fnanchor">891</a> The farmān
he petitioned for being given, he was allowed to go from Kohāt.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>f. March to Thāl.</i>)</p>

<p>Marching out of Kohāt, we took the Hangū-road for Bangash.<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;147.</span>
Between Kohāt and Hangū that road runs through a valley shut
in on either hand by the mountains. When we entered this
valley, the Afghāns of Kohāt and thereabouts who were gathered
on both hill-skirts, raised their war-cry with great clamour. Our
then guide, Malik Bū-sa‘īd <i>Kamarī</i> was well-acquainted with
the Afghān locations; he represented that further on there was
a detached hill on our right, where, if the Afghāns came down
to it from the hill-skirt, we might surround and take them. God
brought it right! The Afghāns, on reaching the place, did come
down. We ordered one party of braves to seize the neck of
land between that hill and the mountains, others to move along
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>its sides, so that under attack made from all sides at once, the
Afghāns might be made to reach their doom. Against the allround
assault, they could not even fight; a hundred or two were
taken, some were brought in alive but of most, the heads only
were brought. We had been told that when Afghāns are powerless
to resist, they go before their foe with grass between their
teeth, this being as much as to say, “I am your cow.”<a name="FNanchor_892" id="FNanchor_892"></a><a href="#Footnote_892" class="fnanchor">892</a> Here
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;147b.</span>we saw this custom; Afghāns unable to make resistance, came
before us with grass between their teeth. Those our men had
brought in as prisoners were ordered to be beheaded and a pillar
of their heads was set up in our camp.<a name="FNanchor_893" id="FNanchor_893"></a><a href="#Footnote_893" class="fnanchor">893</a></p>

<p>Next day we marched forward and dismounted at Hangū,
where local Afghāns had made a <i>sangur</i> on a hill. I first heard
the word <i>sangur</i> after coming to Kābul where people describe
fortifying themselves on a hill as making a <i>sangur</i>. Our men
went straight up, broke into it and cut off a hundred or two of
insolent Afghān heads. There also a pillar of heads was set up.</p>

<p>From Hangū we marched, with one night’s halt, to Tīl (Thāl),<a name="FNanchor_894" id="FNanchor_894"></a><a href="#Footnote_894" class="fnanchor">894</a>
below Bangash; there also our men went out and raided the
Afghāns near-by; some of them however turned back rather
lightly from a <i>sangur</i>.<a name="FNanchor_895" id="FNanchor_895"></a><a href="#Footnote_895" class="fnanchor">895</a></p>

<p class="indent">(<i>g. Across country into Bannū.</i>)</p>

<p>On leaving Tīl (Thāl) we went, without a road, right down

(Sheep-road),&mdash;<i>liyār</i> being Afghānī for a road,&mdash;because
sometimes shepherds and herdsmen take their flocks and herds
by it through those narrows. Most of our men regarded our
being brought down by that left-hand road as an ill-design of
Malik Bū-sa‘īd <i>Kamarī</i>.<a name="FNanchor_897" id="FNanchor_897"></a><a href="#Footnote_897" class="fnanchor">897</a></p>

<p class="indent">(<i>h. Bannū and the ‘Īsa-khail country.</i>)</p>

<p>The Bannū lands lie, a dead level, immediately outside the
Bangash and Naghr hills, these being to their north. The
Bangash torrent (the Kūrām) comes down into Bannū and
fertilizes its lands. South(-east) of them are Chaupāra and the
water of Sind; to their east is Dīn-kot; (south-)west is the Plain
(Dasht), known also as Bāzār and Tāq.<a name="FNanchor_898" id="FNanchor_898"></a><a href="#Footnote_898" class="fnanchor">898</a> The Bannū lands are

<p>After dismounting in Bannū, we heard that the tribesmen in
the Plain (Dasht) were for resisting and were entrenching
themselves on a hill to the north. A force headed by Jahāngīr
Mīrzā, went against what seemed to be the Kīwī <i>sangur</i>, took it
at once, made general slaughter, cut off and brought in many
heads. Much white cloth fell into (their) hands. In Bannū
also a pillar of heads was set up. After the <i>sangur</i> had been
taken, the Kīwī head-man, Shādī Khān, came to my presence,
with grass between his teeth, and did me obeisance. I pardoned
all the prisoners.</p>

Plain was close by, with its good roads and many people; so it
was settled to over-run the Plain and to return to Kābul
afterwards by way of Farmūl.<a name="FNanchor_899" id="FNanchor_899"></a><a href="#Footnote_899" class="fnanchor">899</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p><p>Marching next day, we dismounted at an ‘Īsa-khail village on
that same water (the Kūrām) but, as the villagers had gone into
the Chaupāra hills on hearing of us, we left it and dismounted
on the skirt of Chaupāra. Our foragers went from there into
the hills, destroyed the ‘Īsa-khail <i>sangur</i> and came back with
sheep, herds and cloth. That night the ‘Īsa-khail made an
attack on us but, as good watch was kept all through these
operations, they could do nothing. So cautious were we that at
night our right and left, centre and van were just in the way
they had dismounted, each according to its place in battle, each
prepared for its own post, with men on foot all round the camp, at
an arrow’s distance from the tents. Every night the army was
posted in this way and every night three or four of my household
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;149.</span>made the rounds with torches, each in his turn. I for my part
made the round once each night. Those not at their posts had
their noses slit and were led round through the army. Jahāngīr
Mīrzā was the right wing, with Bāqī <i>Chaghānīānī</i>, Sherīm T̤aghāī,
Sayyid Ḥusain Akbar, and other begs. Mīrzā Khān was the
left wing, with ‘Abdu’r-razzāq Mīrzā, Qāsīm Beg and other begs.
In the centre there were no great begs, all were household-begs.
Sayyid Qāsim Lord-of-the-gate, was the van, with Bābā Aūghūlī,
Allāh-bīrdī (var. Allāh-qulī Purān), and some other begs. The
army was in six divisions, each of which had its day and night
on guard.</p>

<p>Marching from that hill-skirt, our faces set west, we dismounted
on a waterless plain (<i>qūl</i>) between Bannū and the Plain. The
soldiers got water here for themselves, their herds and so on, by
digging down, from one to one-and-a-half yards, into the dry
water-course, when water came. Not here only did this happen
for all the rivers of Hindūstān have the peculiarity that water is
safe to be found by digging down from one to one-and-a-half
yards in their beds. It is a wonderful provision of God that where,
except for the great rivers, there are no running-waters,<a name="FNanchor_900" id="FNanchor_900"></a><a href="#Footnote_900" class="fnanchor">900</a> water
should be so placed within reach in dry water-courses.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>
<p>We left that dry channel next morning. Some of our men,
riding light, reached villages of the Plain in the afternoon, raided
a few, and brought back flocks, cloth and horses bred for trade.<a name="FNanchor_901" id="FNanchor_901"></a><a href="#Footnote_901" class="fnanchor">901</a>
Pack-animals and camels and also the braves we had outdistanced,
kept coming into camp all through that night till dawn and on
till that morrow’s noon. During our stay there, the foragers<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;149b.</span>
brought in from villages in the Plain, masses of sheep and cattle,
and, from Afghān traders met on the roads, white cloths, aromatic
roots, sugars, <i>tīpūchāqs</i>, and horses bred for trade. Hindī (var.
Mindī) <i>Mughūl</i> unhorsed Khwāja Khiẓr <i>Lūhānī</i>, a well-known
and respected Afghān merchant, cutting off and bringing in his
head. Once when Sherīm T̤aghāī went in the rear of the foragers,
an Afghān faced him on the road and struck off his index-finger.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>i. Return made for Kābul.</i>)</p>

<p>Two roads were heard of as leading from where we were to
Ghaznī; one was the Tunnel-rock (Sang-i-sūrākh) road, passing
Birk (Barak) and going on to Farmūl; the other was one along
the Gūmāl, which also comes out at Farmūl but without touching
Birk (Barak).<a name="FNanchor_902" id="FNanchor_902"></a><a href="#Footnote_902" class="fnanchor">902</a> As during our stay in the Plain rain had fallen
incessantly, the Gūmāl was so swollen that it would have been
difficult to cross at the ford we came to; moreover persons well-acquainted
with the roads, represented that going by the Gūmāl
road, this torrent must be crossed several times, that this was
always difficult when the waters were so high and that there was
always uncertainty on the Gūmāl road. Nothing was settled
then as to which of these two roads to take; I expected it to be
settled next day when, after the drum of departure had sounded,<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;150.</span>
we talked it over as we went.<a name="FNanchor_903" id="FNanchor_903"></a><a href="#Footnote_903" class="fnanchor">903</a> It was the ‘Īd-i-fitr (March 7th
1505 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>); while I was engaged in the ablutions due for the
breaking of the fast, Jahāngīr Mīrzā and the begs discussed the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>question of the roads. Some-one said that if we were to turn
the bill<a name="FNanchor_904" id="FNanchor_904"></a><a href="#Footnote_904" class="fnanchor">904</a> of the Mehtar Sulaimān range, this lying between
the Plain and the Hill-country (<i>desht u dūkī</i>),<a name="FNanchor_905" id="FNanchor_905"></a><a href="#Footnote_905" class="fnanchor">905</a> we should get
a level road though it might make the difference of a few marches.
For this they decided and moved off; before my ablutions were
finished the whole army had taken the road and most of it was
across the Gūmāl. Not a man of us had ever seen the road;
no-one knew whether it was long or short; we started off just
on a rumoured word!</p>

<p>The Prayer of the ‘Id was made on the bank of the Gūmāl.
That year New-year’s Day<a name="FNanchor_906" id="FNanchor_906"></a><a href="#Footnote_906" class="fnanchor">906</a> fell close to the ‘Id-i-fitr, there being
only a few days between; on their approximation I composed
the following (Turkī) ode:&mdash;</p>

<p>After crossing the Gūmāl torrent, we took our way along the
skirt of the hills, our faces set south. A mile or two further on,
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;150b.</span>some death-devoted Afghāns shewed themselves on the lower
edge of the hill-slope. Loose rein, off we went for them; most
of them fled but some made foolish stand on rocky-piles<a name="FNanchor_908" id="FNanchor_908"></a><a href="#Footnote_908" class="fnanchor">908</a> of the
foot-hills. One took post on a single rock seeming to have
a precipice on the further side of it, so that he had not even a way
of escape. Sl. Qulī <i>Chūnāq</i> (One-eared), all in his mail as he was,
got up, slashed at, and took him. This was one of Sl. Qulī’s
deeds done under my own eyes, which led to his favour and
promotion.<a name="FNanchor_909" id="FNanchor_909"></a><a href="#Footnote_909" class="fnanchor">909</a> At another pile of rock, when Qūtlūq-qadam
exchanged blows with an Afghān, they grappled and came down
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>together, a straight fall of 10 to 12 yards; in the end Qūtlūq-qadam
cut off and brought in his man’s head. Kūpūk Beg got
hand-on-collar with an Afghān at another hill; both rolled down
to the bottom; that head also was brought in. All Afghāns
taken prisoner were set free.</p>

<p>Marching south through the Plain, and closely skirting Mehtar
Sulaimān, we came, with three nights’ halt, to a small township,
called Bīlah, on the Sind-water and dependent on Multān.<a name="FNanchor_910" id="FNanchor_910"></a><a href="#Footnote_910" class="fnanchor">910</a> The
villagers crossed the water, mostly taking to their boats, but
some flung themselves in to cross. Some were seen standing on
an island in front of Bīlah. Most of our men, man and horse in<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;151.</span>
mail, plunged in and crossed to the island; some were carried
down, one being Qul-i-arūk (thin slave), one of my servants,
another the head tent-pitcher, another Jahāngīr Mīrzā’s servant,
Qāītmās <i>Turkmān</i>.<a name="FNanchor_911" id="FNanchor_911"></a><a href="#Footnote_911" class="fnanchor">911</a> Cloth and things of the baggage (<i>partaldīk
nīma</i>) fell to our men. The villagers all crossed by boat to the
further side of the river; once there, some of them, trusting to
the broad water, began to make play with their swords. Qul-i-bāyazīd,
the taster, one of our men who had crossed to the island,
stripped himself and his horse and, right in front of them,
plunged by himself into the river. The water on that side of
the island may have been twice or thrice as wide as on ours.
He swum his horse straight for them till, an arrow’s-flight away,
he came to a shallow where his weight must have been up-borne,
the water being as high as the saddle-flap. There he stayed for
as long as milk takes to boil; no-one supported him from
behind; he had not a chance of support. He made a dash at
them; they shot a few arrows at him but, this not checking him,
they took to flight. To swim such a river as the Sind, alone,
bare on a bare-backed horse, no-one behind him, and to chase
off a foe and occupy his ground, was a mightily bold deed! He
having driven the enemy off, other soldiers went over who<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;151b.</span>
returned with cloth and droves of various sorts. Qul-i-bāyazīd
had already his place in my favour and kindness on account of
his good service, and of courage several times shewn; from the
cook’s office I had raised him to the royal taster’s; this time, as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>will be told, I took up a position full of bounty, favour and
promotion,&mdash;in truth he was worthy of honour and advancement.</p>

<p>Two other marches were made down the Sind-water. Our
men, by perpetually gallopping off on raids, had knocked up
their horses; usually what they took, cattle mostly, was not
worth the gallop; sometimes indeed in the Plain there had been
sheep, sometimes one sort of cloth or other, but, the Plain left
behind, nothing was had but cattle. A mere servant would
bring in 3 or 400 head during our marches along the Sind-water,
but every march many more would be left on the road than
they brought in.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>j. The westward march.</i>)</p>

<p>Having made three more marches<a name="FNanchor_912" id="FNanchor_912"></a><a href="#Footnote_912" class="fnanchor">912</a> close along the Sind, we
left it when we came opposite Pīr Kānū’s tomb.<a name="FNanchor_913" id="FNanchor_913"></a><a href="#Footnote_913" class="fnanchor">913</a> Going to the
tomb, we there dismounted. Some of our soldiers having injured
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;152.</span>several of those in attendance on it, I had them cut to pieces.
It is a tomb on the skirt of one of the Mehtar Sulaimān
mountains and held in much honour in Hindūstān.</p>

<p>Marching on from Pīr Kānū, we dismounted in the (Pawat)
pass; next again in the bed of a torrent in Dūkī.<a name="FNanchor_914" id="FNanchor_914"></a><a href="#Footnote_914" class="fnanchor">914</a> After we
left this camp there were brought in as many as 20 to 30
followers of a retainer of Shāh Beg, Fāẓil <i>Kūkūldāsh</i>, the
dārogha of Sīwī. They had been sent to reconnoitre us but, as
at that time, we were not on bad terms with Shāh Beg, we let
them go, with horse and arms. After one night’s halt, we
reached Chūtīālī, a village of Dūkī.</p>

<p>Although our men had constantly gallopped off to raid, both
before we reached the Sind-water and all along its bank, they
had not left horses behind, because there had been plenty of green
food and corn. When, however, we left the river and set our
faces for Pīr Kānū, not even green food was to be had; a little
land under green crop might be found every two or three
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>marches, but of horse-corn, none. So, beyond the camps
mentioned, there began the leaving of horses behind. After
passing Chūtīālī, my own felt-tent<a name="FNanchor_915" id="FNanchor_915"></a><a href="#Footnote_915" class="fnanchor">915</a> had to be left from want of
baggage-beasts. One night at that time, it rained so much, that
water stood knee-deep in my tent (<i>chādār</i>); I watched the night
out till dawn, uncomfortably sitting on a pile of blankets.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>k. Bāqī Chaghānīānī’s treachery.</i>)</p>

<p>A few marches further on came Jahāngīr Mīrzā, saying, “I<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;152b.</span>
have a private word for you.” When we were in private, he
said, “Bāqī <i>Chaghānīānī</i> came and said to me, ‘You make the
Pādshāh cross the water of Sind with 7, 8, 10 persons, then
make yourself Pādshāh.’” Said I, “What others are heard of as
consulting with him?” Said he, “It was but a moment ago
Bāqī Beg spoke to me; I know no more.” Said I, “Find out
who the others are; likely enough Sayyid Ḥusain Akbar and
Sl. ‘Alī the page are in it, as well as Khusrau Shāh’s begs and
braves.” Here the Mīrzā really behaved very well and like
a blood-relation; what he now did was the counterpart of what
I had done in Kāhmard,<a name="FNanchor_916" id="FNanchor_916"></a><a href="#Footnote_916" class="fnanchor">916</a> in this same ill-fated mannikin’s other
scheme of treachery.<a name="FNanchor_917" id="FNanchor_917"></a><a href="#Footnote_917" class="fnanchor">917</a></p>

<p>On dismounting after the next march, I made Jahāngīr Mīrzā
lead a body of well-mounted men to raid the Aūghāns (Afghāns)
of that neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Many men’s horses were now left behind in each camping-ground,
the day coming when as many as 2 or 300 were left.
Braves of the first rank went on foot; Sayyid Maḥmūd
<i>Aūghlāqchī</i>, one of the best of the household-braves, left his
horses behind and walked. In this state as to horses we went
all the rest of the way to Ghaznī.</p>

<p>Three or four marches further on, Jahāngīr Mīrzā plundered<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;153.</span>
some Afghāns and brought in a few sheep.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>l. The Āb-i-istāda.</i>)</p>

<p>When, with a few more marches, we reached the Standing-water
(<i>Āb-i-istāda</i>) a wonderfully large sheet of water presented
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>itself to view; the level lands on its further side could not be
seen at all; its water seemed to join the sky; the higher land
and the mountains of that further side looked to hang between
Heaven and Earth, as in a mirage. The waters there gathered
are said to be those of the spring-rain floods of the Kattawāz-plain,
the Zurmut-valley, and the Qarā-bāgh meadow of the
Ghaznī-torrent,&mdash;floods of the spring-rains, and the over-plus<a name="FNanchor_918" id="FNanchor_918"></a><a href="#Footnote_918" class="fnanchor">918</a> of
the summer-rise of streams.</p>

<p>When within two miles of the Āb-i-istāda, we saw a wonderful
thing,&mdash;something as red as the rose of the dawn kept shewing
and vanishing between the sky and the water. It kept coming
and going. When we got quite close we learned that what
seemed the cause were flocks of geese,<a name="FNanchor_919" id="FNanchor_919"></a><a href="#Footnote_919" class="fnanchor">919</a> not 10,000, not 20,000
in a flock, but geese innumerable which, when the mass of birds
flapped their wings in flight, sometimes shewed red feathers,
sometimes not. Not only was this bird there in countless
numbers, but birds of every sort. Eggs lay in masses on the
shore. When two Afghāns, come there to collect eggs, saw us,
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;153b.</span>they went into the water half a <i>kuroh</i> (a mile). Some of our
men following, brought them back. As far as they went the
water was of one depth, up to a horse’s belly; it seemed not to
lie in a hollow, the country being flat.</p>

<p>We dismounted at the torrent coming down to the Āb-i-istāda
from the plain of Kattawāz. The several other times we have
passed it, we have found a dry channel with no water whatever,<a name="FNanchor_920" id="FNanchor_920"></a><a href="#Footnote_920" class="fnanchor">920</a>
but this time, there was so much water, from the spring-rains,
that no ford could be found. The water was not very broad
but very deep. Horses and camels were made to swim it; some
of the baggage was hauled over with ropes. Having got across,
we went on through Old Nānī and Sar-i-dih to Ghaznī where
for a few days Jahāngīr Mīrzā was our host, setting food before
us and offering his tribute.</p>

<p>That year most waters came down in flood. No ford was
found through the water of Dih-i-yaq‘ūb.<a name="FNanchor_921" id="FNanchor_921"></a><a href="#Footnote_921" class="fnanchor">921</a> For this reason we
went straight on to Kamarī, through the Sajāwand-pass. At
Kamarī I had a boat fashioned in a pool, brought and set on the

were put over.</p>

<p>It has been mentioned that at Qūsh-guṃbaz, Nāṣir Mīrzā
asked leave to stay behind, saying that he would follow in a few
days after taking something from his district for his retainers
and followers.<a name="FNanchor_923" id="FNanchor_923"></a><a href="#Footnote_923" class="fnanchor">923</a> But having left us, he sent a force against the
people of Nūr-valley, they having done something a little
refractory. The difficulty of moving in that valley owing to the
strong position of its fort and the rice-cultivation of its lands,
has already been described.<a name="FNanchor_924" id="FNanchor_924"></a><a href="#Footnote_924" class="fnanchor">924</a> The Mīrzā’s commander, Faẓlī, in
ground so impracticable and in that one-road tract, instead of
safe-guarding his men, scattered them to forage. Out came the
valesmen, drove the foragers off, made it impossible to the rest
to keep their ground, killed some, captured a mass of others
and of horses,&mdash;precisely what would happen to any army
chancing to be under such a person as Faẓlī! Whether because
of this affair, or whether from want of heart, the Mīrzā did not
follow us at all; he stayed behind.</p>

<p>Moreover Ayūb’s sons, Yūsuf and Bahlūl (Begchīk), more
seditious, silly and arrogant persons than whom there may not
exist,&mdash;to whom I had given, to Yūsuf Alangār, to Bahlūl ‘Alī-shang,
they like Nāṣir Mīrzā, were to have taken something from<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;154b.</span>
their districts and to have come on with him, but, he not coming,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>neither did they. All that winter they were the companions of

Afghāns in it.<a name="FNanchor_925" id="FNanchor_925"></a><a href="#Footnote_925" class="fnanchor">925</a> With the on-coming heats, the Mīrzā made
march off the families of the clans, outside-tribes and hordes who

<p>While Nāṣir Mīrzā was in camp on the Bārān-water, he heard
that the Badakhshīs were united against the Aūzbegs and had
killed some of them.</p>

Qūndūz to Qaṃbar Bī and gone himself to Khwārizm<a name="FNanchor_927" id="FNanchor_927"></a><a href="#Footnote_927" class="fnanchor">927</a>; Qaṃbar
Bī, in order to conciliate the Badakhshīs, sent them a son of
Muḥammad-i-makhdūmī, Maḥmūd by name, but Mubārak Shāh,&mdash;whose
ancestors are heard of as begs of the Badakhshān
Shāhs,&mdash;having uplifted his own head, and cut off Maḥmūd’s and
those of some Aūzbegs, made himself fast in the fort once known
as Shāf-tiwār but re-named by him Qila‘-i-z̤afar. Moreover, in
Rustāq Muḥammad <i>qūrchī</i>, an armourer of Khusrau Shāh, then
occupying Khamalangān, slew Shaibāq Khān’s <i>ṣadr</i> and some
Aūzbegs and made that place fast. Zubair of Rāgh, again,
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;155.</span>whose forefathers also will have been begs of the Badakhshān

<p>Nāṣir Mīrzā, hearing these various items of news and spurred
on by the instigation of a few silly, short-sighted persons to
covet Badakhshān, marched along the Shibr-tū and Āb-dara

had behaved unmannerly to him; what brands had they not set
on his heart! Yet all now went to him in their distress, and all

him if I had not made Khusrau Shāh helpless by parting him
from his following, and if I had not taken Kābul from Ẕū’n’nūn’s

to his own country, saying, “If I go, I shall get it all into my
hands.” As he had reached Herī without equipment and without
resources, they finessed a little about his leave. He became
importunate. Muḥammad Barandūq retorted roundly on him
with, “When you had 30,000 men behind you and the whole
country in your hands, what did you effect against the Aūzbeg?
What will you do now with your 500 men and the Aūzbegs in
possession?” He added a little good advice in a few sensible
words, but all was in vain because the fated hour of Khusrau
Shāh’s death was near. Leave was at last given because of his
importunity; Khusrau Shāh with his 3 or 400 followers, went
straight into the borders of Dahānah. There as Nāṣir Mīrzā
had just gone across, these two met.</p>

<p>Now the Badakhshī chiefs had invited only the Mīrzā; they
had not invited Khusrau Shāh. Try as the Mīrzā did to persuade
Khusrau Shāh to go into the hill-country,<a name="FNanchor_932" id="FNanchor_932"></a><a href="#Footnote_932" class="fnanchor">932</a> the latter, quite
understanding the whole time, would not consent to go, his own
idea being that if he marched under the Mīrzā, he would get the<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;156.</span>
country into his own hands. In the end, unable to agree, each
of them, near Ishkīmīsh, arrayed his following, put on mail, drew
out to fight, and&mdash;departed. Nāṣir Mīrzā went on for Badakhshān;
Khusrau Shāh after collecting a disorderly rabble, good and bad
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>of some 1,000 persons, went, with the intention of laying siege
to Qūndūz, to Khwāja Chār-tāq, one or two <i>yīghāch</i> outside it.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>q. Death of Khusrau Shāh.</i>)</p>

<p>At the time Shaibāq Khān, after overcoming Sult̤ān Aḥmad
<i>Taṃbal</i> and Andijān, made a move on Ḥiṣār, his Honour
Khusrau Shāh<a name="FNanchor_933" id="FNanchor_933"></a><a href="#Footnote_933" class="fnanchor">933</a> flung away his country (Qūndūz and Ḥiṣār)
without a blow struck, and saved himself. Thereupon Shaibāq
Khān went to Ḥiṣār in which were Sherīm the page and a few
good braves. <i>They</i> did not surrender Ḥiṣār, though their
honourable beg had flung <i>his</i> country away and gone off; they
made Ḥiṣār fast. The siege of Ḥiṣār Shaibāq Khān entrusted to
Ḥamza Sl. and Mahdī Sult̤ān,<a name="FNanchor_934" id="FNanchor_934"></a><a href="#Footnote_934" class="fnanchor">934</a> went to Qūndūz, gave Qūndūz to
his younger brother, Maḥmūd Sult̤ān and betook himself without
delay to Khwārizm against Chīn Ṣūfī. But as, before he reached
Samarkand on his way to Khwārizm, he heard of the death in
Qūndūz of his brother, Maḥmūd Sult̤ān, he gave that place to
Qaṃbar Bī of Marv.<a name="FNanchor_935" id="FNanchor_935"></a><a href="#Footnote_935" class="fnanchor">935</a></p>

<p>Qaṃbar Bī was in Qūndūz when Khusrau Shāh went against
it; he at once sent off galloppers to summon Ḥamza Sl. and the
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;156b.</span>others Shaibāq Khān had left behind. Ḥamza Sl. came himself
as far as the <i>sarāī</i> on the Amū bank where he put his sons and
begs in command of a force which went direct against Khusrau
Shāh. There was neither fight nor flight for that fat, little man;
Ḥamza Sult̤ān’s men unhorsed him, killed his sister’s son,
Aḥmad-i-qāsim, Sherīm the page and several good braves. Him
they took into Qūndūz, there struck his head off and from there
sent it to Shaibāq Khān in Khwārizm.<a name="FNanchor_936" id="FNanchor_936"></a><a href="#Footnote_936" class="fnanchor">936</a></p>

<p class="indent">(<i>a. Death of Qūtlūq-nigār Khānīm.</i>)</p>

<p>In the month of Muḥarram my mother had fever. Blood
was let without effect and a Khurāsānī doctor, known as Sayyid
T̤abīb, in accordance with the Khurāsān practice, gave her
water-melon, but her time to die must have come, for on the
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;157.</span>Saturday after six days of illness, she went to God’s mercy.</p>

<p>On Sunday I and Qāsim Kūkūldāsh conveyed her to the

for her, people let me know about (the death of) my younger

Begīm.<a name="FNanchor_943" id="FNanchor_943"></a><a href="#Footnote_943" class="fnanchor">943</a> Close upon Khānīm’s Fortieth<a name="FNanchor_944" id="FNanchor_944"></a><a href="#Footnote_944" class="fnanchor">944</a> arrived from Khurāsān

afresh; the bitterness of these partings was extreme. When
the mourning-rites had been observed, food and victuals set out
for the poor and destitute, the Qorān recited, and prayers offered
for the departed souls, we steadied ourselves and all took heart
again.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>b. A futile start for Qandahār.</i>)</p>

<p>When set free from these momentous duties, we got an army
to horse for Qandahār under the strong insistance of Bāqī
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span><i>Chaghānīānī</i>. At the start I went to Qūsh-nādir (var. nāwar)
where on dismounting I got fever. It was a strange sort of
illness for whenever with much trouble I had been awakened,
my eyes closed again in sleep. In four or five days I got
quite well.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>c. An earthquake.</i>)</p>

<p>At that time there was a great earthquake<a name="FNanchor_946" id="FNanchor_946"></a><a href="#Footnote_946" class="fnanchor">946</a> such that most of
the ramparts of forts and the walls of gardens fell down; houses
were levelled to the ground in towns and villages and many
persons lay dead beneath them. Every house fell in Paghmān-village,<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;157b.</span>
and 70 to 80 strong heads-of-houses lay dead under
their walls. Between Pagh-mān and Beg-tūt<a name="FNanchor_947" id="FNanchor_947"></a><a href="#Footnote_947" class="fnanchor">947</a> a piece of ground,
a good stone-throw<a name="FNanchor_948" id="FNanchor_948"></a><a href="#Footnote_948" class="fnanchor">948</a> wide may-be, slid down as far as an
arrow’s-flight; where it had slid springs appeared. On the
road between Istarghach and Maidān the ground was so broken
up for 6 to 8 <i>yīghāch</i> (36-48 m.) that in some places it rose as
high as an elephant, in others sank as deep; here and there
people were sucked in. When the Earth quaked, dust rose from
the tops of the mountains. Nūru’l-lāh the <i>t̤ambourchī</i><a name="FNanchor_949" id="FNanchor_949"></a><a href="#Footnote_949" class="fnanchor">949</a> had
been playing before me; he had two instruments with him and
at the moment of the quake had both in his hands; so out of
his own control was he that the two knocked against each other.
Jahāngīr Mīrzā was in the porch of an upper-room at a house
built by Aūlūgh Beg Mīrzā in Tīpa; when the Earth quaked,
he let himself down and was not hurt, but the roof fell on
some-one with him in that upper-room, presumably one of his
own circle; that this person was not hurt in the least must have
been solely through God’s mercy. In Tīpa most of the houses
were levelled to the ground. The Earth quaked 33 times on
the first day, and for a month afterwards used to quake two or
three times in the 24 hours. The begs and soldiers having been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>ordered to repair the breaches made in the towers and ramparts
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;158.</span>of the fort (Kābul), everything was made good again in 20 days
or a month by their industry and energy.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>d. Campaign against Qalāt-i-ghilzāī.</i>)</p>

<p>Owing to my illness and to the earthquake, our plan of going
to Qandahār had fallen somewhat into the background. The
illness left behind and the fort repaired, it was taken up again.
We were undecided at the time we dismounted below Shniz<a name="FNanchor_950" id="FNanchor_950"></a><a href="#Footnote_950" class="fnanchor">950</a>
whether to go to Qandahār, or to over-run the hills and plains.
Jahāngīr Mīrzā and the begs having assembled, counsel was
taken and the matter found settlement in a move on Qalāt. On
this move Jahāngīr Mīrzā and Bāqī <i>Chaghānīānī</i> insisted strongly.</p>

<p>At Tāzī<a name="FNanchor_951" id="FNanchor_951"></a><a href="#Footnote_951" class="fnanchor">951</a> there was word that Sher-i-‘alī the page with Kīchīk
Bāqī <i>Diwāna</i> and others had thoughts of desertion; all were
arrested; Sher-i-‘alī was put to death because he had given clear
signs of disloyalty and misdoing both while in my service and
not in mine, in this country and in that country.<a name="FNanchor_952" id="FNanchor_952"></a><a href="#Footnote_952" class="fnanchor">952</a> The others
were let go with loss of horse and arms.</p>

<p>On arriving at Qalāt we attacked at once and from all sides,
without our mail and without siege-appliances. As has been
mentioned in this History, Kīchīk Khwāja, the elder brother of
Khwāja Kalān, was a most daring brave; he had used his sword
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;158b.</span>in my presence several times; he now clambered up the south-west
tower of Qalāt, was pricked in the eye with a spear when
almost up, and died of the wound two or three days after the
place was taken. Here that Kīchīk Bāqī <i>Dīwāna</i> who had been
arrested when about to desert with Sher-i-‘alī the page, expiated
his baseness by being killed with a stone when he went under
the ramparts. One or two other men died also. Fighting of
this sort went on till the Afternoon Prayer when, just as our
men were worn-out with the struggle and labour, those in the
fort asked for peace and made surrender. Qalāt had been given
by Ẕū’n-nūn <i>Arghūn</i> to Muqīm, and in it now were Muqīm’s
retainers, Farrukh <i>Arghūn</i> and Qarā <i>Bīlūt</i> (Afghān). When
they came out with their swords and quivers hanging round
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>their necks, we forgave their offences.<a name="FNanchor_953" id="FNanchor_953"></a><a href="#Footnote_953" class="fnanchor">953</a> It was not my wish to
reduce this high family<a name="FNanchor_954" id="FNanchor_954"></a><a href="#Footnote_954" class="fnanchor">954</a> to great straits; for why? Because if
we did so when such a foe as the Aūzbeg was at our side, what
would be said by those of far and near, who saw and heard?</p>

<p>As the move on Qalāt had been made under the insistance of
Jahāngīr Mīrzā and Bāqī <i>Chaghānīānī</i>, it was now made over to
the Mīrzā’s charge. He would not accept it; Bāqī also could
give no good answer in the matter. So, after such a storming
and assaulting of Qalāt, its capture was useless.</p>

<p>We went back to Kābul after over-running the Afghāns of
Sawā-sang and Ālā-tāgh on the south of Qalāt.<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;159.</span></p>

<p>The night we dismounted at Kābul I went into the fort;
my tent and stable being in the Chār-bāgh, a Khirilchī thief
going into the garden, fetched out and took away a bay horse
of mine with its accoutrements, and my <i>khachar</i>.<a name="FNanchor_955" id="FNanchor_955"></a><a href="#Footnote_955" class="fnanchor">955</a></p>

<p class="indent">(<i>e. Death of Bāqī Chaghānīānī.</i>)</p>

done things bad and unmannerly. Mean he was, miserly and
malicious, ill-tongued, envious and cross-natured. So miserly
was he that although when he left Tīrmīẕ, with his family and
possessions, he may have owned 30 to 40,000 sheep, and
although those masses of sheep used to pass in front of us at
every camping-ground, he did not give a single one to our bare
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>braves, tortured as they were by the pangs of hunger; at last in
Kāh-mard, he gave 50!</p>

<p>Spite of acknowledging me for his chief (<i>pādshāh</i>), he had
nagarets beaten at his own Gate. He was sincere to none, had
regard for none. What revenue there is from Kābul (town)
comes from the <i>t̤amghā</i><a name="FNanchor_957" id="FNanchor_957"></a><a href="#Footnote_957" class="fnanchor">957</a>; the whole of this he had, together

Hazāra, and <i>kūshlūk</i><a name="FNanchor_958" id="FNanchor_958"></a><a href="#Footnote_958" class="fnanchor">958</a> and control of the Gate.<a name="FNanchor_959" id="FNanchor_959"></a><a href="#Footnote_959" class="fnanchor">959</a> With all this

we had taken not the smallest notice of any of it, nor had we
cast it in his face. He was always asking for leave, affecting
scruple at making the request. We used to acknowledge the
scruple and excuse ourselves from giving the leave. This
would put him down for a few days; then he would ask again.
He went too far with his affected scruple and his takings of
leave! Sick were we too of his conduct and his character. We
gave the leave; he repented asking for it and began to agitate
against it, but all in vain! He got written down and sent to
me, “His Highness made compact not to call me to account till
nine<a name="FNanchor_960" id="FNanchor_960"></a><a href="#Footnote_960" class="fnanchor">960</a> misdeeds had issued from me.” I answered with a reminder
of eleven successive faults and sent this to him through Mullā
Bābā of Pashāghar. He submitted and was allowed to go
towards Hindūstān, taking his family and possessions. A few
of his retainers escorted him through Khaibar and returned; he
joined Bāqī <i>Gāgīānī’s</i> caravan and crossed at Nīl-āb.</p>

<p>That winter we just sat in the Chār-bāgh till snow had fallen
once or twice.</p>

<p>The Turkmān Hazāras, since we came into Kābul, had done
a variety of insolent things and had robbed on the roads. We
thought therefore of over-running them, went into the town to
Aūlūgh Beg Mīrzā’s house at the Būstān-sarāī, and thence rode
out in the month of Sha‘bān (Feb. 1506 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>).</p>

<p>We raided a few Hazāras at Janglīk, at the mouth of the
Dara-i-khūsh (Happy-valley).<a name="FNanchor_963" id="FNanchor_963"></a><a href="#Footnote_963" class="fnanchor">963</a> Some were in a cave near the
valley-mouth, hiding perhaps. Shaikh Darwīsh Kūkūldāsh went
incautiously right (<i>auq</i>) up to the cave-mouth, was shot (<i>aūqlāb</i>)
in the nipple by a Hazāra inside and died there and then (<i>aūq</i>).<a name="FNanchor_964" id="FNanchor_964"></a><a href="#Footnote_964" class="fnanchor">964</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(<i>Author’s note on Shaikh Darwīsh.</i>) He had been with me in the guerilla-times,
was Master-armourer (<i>qūr-begī</i>), drew a strong bow and shot a good shaft.</p></div>

<p>As most of the Turkmān Hazāras seemed to be wintering
inside the Dara-i-khūsh, we marched against them.</p>

<p>The valley is shut in,<a name="FNanchor_965" id="FNanchor_965"></a><a href="#Footnote_965" class="fnanchor">965</a> by a mile-long gully stretching inwards
from its mouth. The road engirdles the mountain, having<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;160b.</span>
a straight fall of some 50 to 60 yards below it and above it
a precipice. Horsemen go along it in single-file. We passed
the gully and went on through the day till between the Two
Prayers (3 p.m.) without meeting a single person. Having spent
the night somewhere, we found a fat camel<a name="FNanchor_966" id="FNanchor_966"></a><a href="#Footnote_966" class="fnanchor">966</a> belonging to the
Hazāras, had it killed, made part of its flesh into <i>kabābs</i><a name="FNanchor_967" id="FNanchor_967"></a><a href="#Footnote_967" class="fnanchor">967</a> and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>cooked part in a ewer (<i>aftāb</i>). Such good camel-flesh had never
been tasted; some could not tell it from mutton.</p>

<p>Next day we marched on for the Hazāra winter-camp. At
the first watch (9 a.m.) a man came from ahead, saying that the
Hazāras had blocked a ford in front with branches, checked our
men and were fighting. That winter the snow lay very deep;
to move was difficult except on the road. The swampy meadows
(<i>tuk-āb</i>) along the stream were all frozen; the stream could only
be crossed from the road because of snow and ice. The Hazāras
had cut many branches, put them at the exit from the water and
were fighting in the valley-bottom with horse and foot or raining
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;161.</span>arrows down from either side.</p>

<p>Muḥammad ‘Alī <i>Mubashshir</i><a name="FNanchor_968" id="FNanchor_968"></a><a href="#Footnote_968" class="fnanchor">968</a> Beg, one of our most daring
braves, newly promoted to the rank of beg and well worthy of
favour, went along the branch-blocked road without his mail,
was shot in the belly and instantly surrendered his life. As
we had gone forward in haste, most of us were not in mail.
Shaft after shaft flew by and fell; with each one Yūsuf’s Aḥmad
said anxiously, “Bare<a name="FNanchor_969" id="FNanchor_969"></a><a href="#Footnote_969" class="fnanchor">969</a> like this you go into it! I have seen
two arrows go close to your head!” Said I, “Don’t fear!
Many as good arrows as these have flown past my head!” So
much said, Qāsim Beg, his men in full accoutrement,<a name="FNanchor_970" id="FNanchor_970"></a><a href="#Footnote_970" class="fnanchor">970</a> found
a ford on our right and crossed. Before their charge the Hazāras
could make no stand; they fled, swiftly pursued and unhorsed
one after the other by those just up with them.</p>

<p>In guerdon for this feat Bangash was given to Qāsim Beg.
Ḥātim the armourer having been not bad in the affair, was
promoted to Shaikh Darwīsh’s office of <i>qūr-begī</i>. Bābā Qulī’s
Kīpik (<i>sic</i>) also went well forward in it, so we entrusted Muḥ.
‘Alī <i>Mubashshir’s</i> office to him.</p>

<p>Sl. Qulī <i>Chūnāq</i> (one-eared) started in pursuit of the Hazāras
but there was no getting out of the hollow because of the snow.
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;161b.</span>For my own part I just went with these braves.</p>

<p>Near the Hazāra winter-camp we found many sheep and
herds of horses. I myself collected as many as 4 to 500 sheep
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>and from 20 to 25 horses. Sl. Qulī <i>Chūnāq</i> and two or three of
my personal servants were with me. I have ridden in a raid
twice<a name="FNanchor_971" id="FNanchor_971"></a><a href="#Footnote_971" class="fnanchor">971</a>; this was the first time; the other was when, coming in
from Khurāsān (912 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>), we raided these same Turkmān
Hazāras. Our foragers brought in masses of sheep and horses.
The Hazāra wives and their little children had gone off up the
snowy slopes and stayed there; we were rather idle and it was
getting late in the day; so we turned back and dismounted in
their very dwellings. Deep indeed was the snow that winter!
Off the road it was up to a horse’s <i>qāptāl</i>,<a name="FNanchor_972" id="FNanchor_972"></a><a href="#Footnote_972" class="fnanchor">972</a> so deep that the
night-watch was in the saddle all through till shoot of dawn.</p>

<p>Going out of the valley, we spent the next night just inside
the mouth, in the Hazāra winter-quarters. Marching from there,
we dismounted at Janglīk. At Janglīk Yārak T̤aghāī and other
late-comers were ordered to take the Hazāras who had killed
Shaikh Darwīsh and who, luckless and death-doomed, seemed
still to be in the cave. Yārak T̤aghāī and his band by sending
smoke into the cave, took 70 to 80 Hazāras who mostly died by
the sword.</p>

and daring. On this account a force was sent under Jahāngīr

stormed and took a <i>sangur</i> and made a few meet their doom.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>
<p>Because of the sciatic pain, people made a sort of litter
for me in which they carried me along the bank of the Bārān
and into the town to the Būstān-sarāī. There I stayed for
a few days; before that trouble was over a boil came out on
my left cheek; this was lanced and for it I also took a purge.
When relieved, I went out into the Chār-bāgh.</p>

<p>At the time Jahāngīr Mīrzā waited on me, Ayūb’s sons
Yūsuf and Buhlūl, who were in his service, had taken up a
strifeful and seditious attitude towards me; so the Mīrzā was
not found to be what he had been earlier. In a few days
he marched out of Tīpa in his mail,<a name="FNanchor_974" id="FNanchor_974"></a><a href="#Footnote_974" class="fnanchor">974</a> hurried back to Ghaznī,

had been done by me or my dependants to give him ground
for anger or reproach! What was heard of later on as perhaps
explaining his going off in the way he did, was this;&mdash;When
Qāsim Beg went with other begs, to give him honouring
meeting as he came up from Ghaznī, the Mīrzā threw a falcon
off at a quail. Just as the falcon, getting close, put out its
pounce to seize the quail, the quail dropped to the ground.
Hereupon shouts and cries, “Taken! is it taken?” Said
Qāsim Beg, “Who looses the foe in his grip?” Their
misunderstanding of this was their sole reason for going off, but
they backed themselves on one or two other worse and weaker
old cronish matters.<a name="FNanchor_976" id="FNanchor_976"></a><a href="#Footnote_976" class="fnanchor">976</a> After doing in Ghaznī what has been

Sayyid Afẓal, son of Sayyid ‘Alī <i>Khwāb-bīn</i> (Seer-of-dreams).
It was right on several grounds for us to start for Khurāsān.
One ground was that when a great ruler, sitting, as Sl. Ḥusain

such a foe as Shaibāq Khān and had called up many men and
had summoned his sons and his begs, if there were some who
went on foot it was for us to go if on our heads! if some took
the bludgeon, we would take the stone! A second ground was
that, since Jahāngīr Mīrzā had gone to such lengths and had
behaved so badly,<a name="FNanchor_978" id="FNanchor_978"></a><a href="#Footnote_978" class="fnanchor">978</a> we had either to dispel his resentment or to

during the siege; many were the bold deeds done by the
Khwārizmī braves; nothing soever did they leave undone. Again

shield and cuirass, sometimes the two cuirasses.<a name="FNanchor_979" id="FNanchor_979"></a><a href="#Footnote_979" class="fnanchor">979</a> For ten

he was beating and forcing down the Aūzbegs, his own page,

by him she had two sons (Sl. Maḥmūd Khān and
Bahādur Sl.) who went to Herī and were in the Mīrzā’s service.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>b.</i>) <i>His appearance and habits.</i></p>

<p>He was slant-eyed (<i>qīyik gūzlūq</i>) and lion-bodied, being
slender from the waist downwards. Even when old and white-bearded,
he wore silken garments of fine red and green. He
used to wear either the black lambskin cap (<i>būrk</i>) or the
<i>qālpāq</i>,<a name="FNanchor_994" id="FNanchor_994"></a><a href="#Footnote_994" class="fnanchor">994</a> but on a Feast-day would sometimes set up a little
three-fold turban, wound broad and badly,<a name="FNanchor_995" id="FNanchor_995"></a><a href="#Footnote_995" class="fnanchor">995</a> stick a heron’s
plume in it and so go to Prayers.</p>

<p>When he first took Herī, he thought of reciting the names of
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;164b.</span>the Twelve Imāms in the <i>khut̤ba</i>,<a name="FNanchor_996" id="FNanchor_996"></a><a href="#Footnote_996" class="fnanchor">996</a> but ‘Alī-sher Beg and others
prevented it; thereafter all his important acts were done in
accordance with orthodox law. He could not perform the
Prayers on account of a trouble in the joints,<a name="FNanchor_997" id="FNanchor_997"></a><a href="#Footnote_997" class="fnanchor">997</a> and he kept no
fasts. He was lively and pleasant, rather immoderate in temper,
and with words that matched his temper. He shewed great
respect for the law in several weighty matters; he once
surrendered to the Avengers of blood a son of his own who had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>killed a man, and had him taken to the Judgment-gate (<i>Dāru’l-qaẓā</i>).
He was abstinent for six or seven years after he took
the throne; later on he degraded himself to drink. During the
almost 40 years of his rule<a name="FNanchor_998" id="FNanchor_998"></a><a href="#Footnote_998" class="fnanchor">998</a> in Khurāsān, there may not have
been one single day on which he did not drink after the Mid-day
prayer; earlier than that however he did not drink. What
happened with his sons, the soldiers and the town was that
every-one pursued vice and pleasure to excess. Bold and daring
he was! Time and again he got to work with his own sword,
getting his own hand in wherever he arrayed to fight; no man
of Tīmūr Beg’s line has been known to match him in the slashing
of swords. He had a leaning to poetry and even put a <i>dīwān</i><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">together, writing in Turkī with Ḥusainī for his pen-name.<a name="FNanchor_999" id="FNanchor_999"></a><a href="#Footnote_999" class="fnanchor">999</a></span><br />
Many couplets in his <i>dīwān</i> are not bad; it is however in one
and the same metre throughout. Great ruler though he was,<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;165.</span>
both by the length of his reign (<i>yāsh</i>) and the breadth of his
dominions, he yet, like little people kept fighting-rams, flew
pigeons and fought cocks.</p>

<p>He swam the Gurgān-water<a name="FNanchor_1001" id="FNanchor_1001"></a><a href="#Footnote_1001" class="fnanchor">1001</a> in his guerilla days and gave
a party of Aūzbegs a good beating.</p>

<p>Again,&mdash;with 60 men he fell on 3000 under Pay-master
Muḥammad ‘Alī, sent ahead by Sl. Abū-sa‘īd Mīrzā, and gave
them a downright good beating (868 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>). This was his one

either, and rose from before it (901 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>); he went into Ẕū’n-nūn’s

in Astarābād; on the very day of the fight, one force rejoined
him coming back from Astarābād, and Sl. Mas‘ūd Mīrzā arrived
to join Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā after letting Bāī-sunghar Mīrzā take

and Sīstān to the south. When he once had in his hands such
a town as Herī, his only affair, by day and by night, was with
comfort and pleasure; nor was there a man of his either who
did not take his ease. It followed of course that, as he no
longer tolerated the hardships and fatigue of conquest and

increasing right down to the time of his departure.<a name="FNanchor_1012" id="FNanchor_1012"></a><a href="#Footnote_1012" class="fnanchor">1012</a></p>

<p>Muz̤affar-i-ḥusain Mīrzā was another; he was his father’s
favourite son, but though this favourite, had neither accomplishments
nor character. It was Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā’s over-fondness
for this son that led his other sons into rebellion. The mother
of Shāh-i-gharīb Mīrzā and of Muz̤affar-i-ḥusain Mīrzā was

him to death near Astarābād.<a name="FNanchor_1017" id="FNanchor_1017"></a><a href="#Footnote_1017" class="fnanchor">1017</a></p>

<p>Muḥammad-i-ḥusain Mīrzā was another. He must have been
shut up (<i>bund</i>) with Shāh Ismā‘īl at some place in ‘Irāq and
have become his disciple;<a name="FNanchor_1018" id="FNanchor_1018"></a><a href="#Footnote_1018" class="fnanchor">1018</a> he became a rank heretic later on
and became this although his father and brethren, older and
younger, were all orthodox. He died in Astarābād, still on the
same wrong road, still with the same absurd opinions. A good
deal is heard about his courage and heroism, but no deed of his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>stands out as worthy of record. He may have been poetically-disposed;
here is a couplet of his:&mdash;</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>Farīdūn-i-ḥusain Mīrzā was another. He drew a very strong<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;167.</span>
bow and shot a first-rate shaft; people say his cross-bow
(<i>kamān-i-guroha</i>) may have been 40 <i>bātmāns</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1019" id="FNanchor_1019"></a><a href="#Footnote_1019" class="fnanchor">1019</a> He himself was
very brave but he had no luck in war; he was beaten wherever
he fought. He and his younger brother Ibn-i-ḥusain Mīrzā
were defeated at Rabāt̤-i-dūzd (var. Dudūr) by Tīmūr Sl. and
‘Ubaid Sl. leading Shaibāq Khān’s advance (913 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>?), but he
had done good things there.<a name="FNanchor_1020" id="FNanchor_1020"></a><a href="#Footnote_1020" class="fnanchor">1020</a> In Dāmghān he and Muḥammad-i-zamān
Mīrzā<a name="FNanchor_1021" id="FNanchor_1021"></a><a href="#Footnote_1021" class="fnanchor">1021</a> fell into the hands of Shaibāq Khān who, killing
neither, let both go free. Farīdūn-i-ḥusain Mīrzā went later on
to Qalāt<a name="FNanchor_1022" id="FNanchor_1022"></a><a href="#Footnote_1022" class="fnanchor">1022</a> where Shāh Muḥammad <i>Diwāna</i> had made himself
fast; there when the Aūzbegs took the place, he was captured
and killed. The three sons last-named were by Mīnglī Bībī
Āghācha, Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā’s Aūzbeg mistress.</p>

<p>Ḥaidar Mīrzā was another; his mother Payānda-sult̤ān Begīm
was a daughter of Sl. Abū-sa‘īd Mīrzā. Ḥaidar Mīrzā was
Governor of Balkh and Mashhad for some time during his father’s
life. For him his father, when besieging Ḥiṣār (901 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>) took
(Bega Begīm) a daughter of Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā and Khān-zāda
Begīm; this done, he rose from before Ḥiṣār. One daughter
only<a name="FNanchor_1023" id="FNanchor_1023"></a><a href="#Footnote_1023" class="fnanchor">1023</a> was born of that marriage; she was named Shād (Joy)
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>Begīm and given to ‘Ādil Sl.<a name="FNanchor_1024" id="FNanchor_1024"></a><a href="#Footnote_1024" class="fnanchor">1024</a> when she came to Kābul later
on. Ḥaidar Mīrzā departed from the world in his father’s
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;167b.</span>life-time.</p>

<p>Muḥammad Ma‘ṣūm Mīrzā was another. He had Qandahār
given to him and, as was fitting with this, a daughter of
Aūlūgh Beg Mīrzā, (Bega Begīm), was set aside for him; when
she went to Herī (902 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>), Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā made a splendid
feast, setting up a great <i>chār-t̤āq</i> for it.<a name="FNanchor_1025" id="FNanchor_1025"></a><a href="#Footnote_1025" class="fnanchor">1025</a> Though Qandahār
was given to Muḥ. Ma‘ṣūm Mīrzā, he had neither power nor
influence there, since, if black were done, or if white were done,
the act was Shāh Beg <i>Arghūn’s</i>. On this account the Mīrzā
left Qandahār and went into Khurāsān. He died before his
father.</p>

<p>Farrukh-i-ḥusain Mīrzā was another. Brief life was granted
to him; he bade farewell to the world before his younger brother
Ibrāhīm-i-ḥusain Mīrzā.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>
<p>Ibrāhīm-i-ḥusain Mīrzā was another. They say his disposition
was not bad; he died before his father from bibbing and bibbing
Herī wines.</p>

<p>Ibn-i-ḥusain Mīrzā and Muḥ. Qāsim Mīrzā were others;<a name="FNanchor_1026" id="FNanchor_1026"></a><a href="#Footnote_1026" class="fnanchor">1026</a>
their story will follow. Pāpā Āghācha was the mother of the
five sons last-named.</p>

<p>Of all the Mīrzā’s daughters, Sult̤ānīm Begīm was the oldest.
She had no brother or sister of the full-blood. Her mother,
known as Chūlī (Desert) Begīm, was a daughter of one of the
Aẕāq begs. Sult̤ānīm Begīm had great acquaintance with words
(<i>soz bīlūr aīdī</i>); she was never at fault for a word. Her father
sent her out<a name="FNanchor_1027" id="FNanchor_1027"></a><a href="#Footnote_1027" class="fnanchor">1027</a> to Sl. Wais Mīrzā, the middle son of his own elder
brother Bāī-qarā Mīrzā; she had a son and a daughter by him;
the daughter was sent out to Aīsān-qulī Sl. younger brother of
Yīlī-bārs of the Shabān sult̤āns;<a name="FNanchor_1028" id="FNanchor_1028"></a><a href="#Footnote_1028" class="fnanchor">1028</a> the son is that Muḥammad
Sl. Mīrzā to whom I have given the Qanauj district.<a name="FNanchor_1029" id="FNanchor_1029"></a><a href="#Footnote_1029" class="fnanchor">1029</a> At that
same date Sult̤ānīm Begīm, when on her way with her grandson<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;168.</span>
from Kābul to Hindūstān, went to God’s mercy at Nīl-āb. Her
various people turned back, taking her bones; her grandson
came on.<a name="FNanchor_1030" id="FNanchor_1030"></a><a href="#Footnote_1030" class="fnanchor">1030</a></p>

<p>Four daughters were by Payānda-sult̤ān Begīm. Āq Begīm,
the oldest, was sent out to Muḥammad Qāsim <i>Arlāt</i>, a grandson
of Bega Begīm the younger sister of Bābur Mīrzā;<a name="FNanchor_1031" id="FNanchor_1031"></a><a href="#Footnote_1031" class="fnanchor">1031</a> there was one
daughter (<i>bīr gīna qīz</i>), known as Qarā-gūz (Dark-eyed) Begīm,
whom Nāṣir Mīrzā (<i>Mīrān-shāhī</i>) took. Kīchīk Begīm was the
second; for her Sl. Mas‘ūd Mīrzā had great desire but, try as he
would, Payānda-sult̤ān Begīm, having an aversion for him, would
not give her to him;<a name="FNanchor_1032" id="FNanchor_1032"></a><a href="#Footnote_1032" class="fnanchor">1032</a> she sent Kīchīk Begīm out afterwards
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>to Mullā Khwāja of the line of Sayyid Ātā.<a name="FNanchor_1033" id="FNanchor_1033"></a><a href="#Footnote_1033" class="fnanchor">1033</a> Her third and
fourth daughters Bega Begīm and Āghā Begīm, she gave to
Bābur Mīrzā and Murād Mīrzā the sons of her younger sister,
Rābī‘a-sult̤ān Begīm.<a name="FNanchor_1034" id="FNanchor_1034"></a><a href="#Footnote_1034" class="fnanchor">1034</a></p>

<p>Two other daughters of the Mīrzā were by Mīnglī Bībī
Āghācha. They gave the elder one, Bairam-sult̤ān Begīm to
Sayyid ‘Abdu’l-lāh, one of the sayyids of Andikhūd who was
a grandson of Bāī-qarā Mīrzā<a name="FNanchor_1035" id="FNanchor_1035"></a><a href="#Footnote_1035" class="fnanchor">1035</a> through a daughter. A son of
this marriage, Sayyid Barka<a name="FNanchor_1036" id="FNanchor_1036"></a><a href="#Footnote_1036" class="fnanchor">1036</a> was in my service when Samarkand
was taken (917 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1511 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>); he went to Aūrganj later and
there made claim to rule; the Red-heads<a name="FNanchor_1037" id="FNanchor_1037"></a><a href="#Footnote_1037" class="fnanchor">1037</a> killed him in Astarābād.
Mīnglī Bībī’s second daughter was Fāt̤ima-sult̤ān Begīm; her
they gave to Yādgār(-i-farrukh) Mīrzā of Tīmūr Beg’s line.<a name="FNanchor_1038" id="FNanchor_1038"></a><a href="#Footnote_1038" class="fnanchor">1038</a></p>

<p>Three daughters<a name="FNanchor_1039" id="FNanchor_1039"></a><a href="#Footnote_1039" class="fnanchor">1039</a> were by Pāpā Āghācha. Of these the
oldest, Sult̤ān-nizhād Begīm was made to go out to Iskandar
Mīrzā, youngest son of Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā’s elder brother Bāī-qarā
Mīrzā. The second, (Sa‘ādat-bakht, known as) Begīm Sult̤ān,
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;168b.</span>was given to Sl. Mas‘ūd Mīrzā after his blinding.<a name="FNanchor_1040" id="FNanchor_1040"></a><a href="#Footnote_1040" class="fnanchor">1040</a> By Sl. Mas‘ūd
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>Mīrzā she had one daughter and one son. The daughter was
brought up by Apāq Begīm of Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā’s <i>ḥaram</i>; from
Herī she came to Kābul and was there given to Sayyid Mīrzā
Apāq.<a name="FNanchor_1041" id="FNanchor_1041"></a><a href="#Footnote_1041" class="fnanchor">1041</a> (Sa‘ādat-bakht) Begīm Sult̤ān after the Aūzbeg killed

<p>Another of the Mīrzā’s daughters, ‘Āyisha-sult̤ān Begīm, was
by a mistress, Zubaida Āghācha the grand-daughter of Ḥusain-i-Shaikh
Tīmūr.<a name="FNanchor_1045" id="FNanchor_1045"></a><a href="#Footnote_1045" class="fnanchor">1045</a> They gave her to Qāsim Sl. of the Shabān

<p class="indent">(<i>f. His wives and concubines.</i>)</p>

<p>The wife he first took was Bega Sult̤ān Begīm, a daughter of
Sl. Sanjar of Marv. She was the mother of Badī‘u’z-zamān
Mīrzā. She was very cross-tempered and made the Mīrzā endure
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>much wretchedness, until driven at last to despair, he set himself

<p>God preserve every Musalmān from this misfortune! Would
that not a single cross or ill-tempered wife were left in the world!</p>

<p>Chūlī Begīm was another; she was a daughter of the Aẕāq
begs and was the mother of Sult̤ānīm Begīm.</p>

<p>Shahr-bānū Begīm was another; she was Sl. Abū-sa‘īd Mīrzā’s
daughter, taken after Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā took the throne (873 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH</span>.).
When the Mīrzā’s other ladies got out of their litters and mounted
horses, at the battle of Chīkmān, Shahr-bānū Begīm, putting her
trust in her younger brother (Sl. Maḥmūd M.), did not leave her
litter, did not mount a horse;<a name="FNanchor_1050" id="FNanchor_1050"></a><a href="#Footnote_1050" class="fnanchor">1050</a> people told the Mīrzā of this, so
he divorced her and took her younger sister Payānda-sult̤ān
Begīm. When the Aūzbegs took Khurāsān (913 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH</span>.), Payānda-sult̤ān
Begīm went into ‘Irāq, and in ‘Irāq she died in great
misery.</p>

<p>Khadīja Begīm was another.<a name="FNanchor_1051" id="FNanchor_1051"></a><a href="#Footnote_1051" class="fnanchor">1051</a> She had been a mistress of
Sl. Abū-sa‘īd Mīrzā and by him had had a daughter, Āq Begīm;
after his defeat (873 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH</span>.-1468 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD</span>.) she betook herself to Herī
where Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā took her, made her a great favourite,
and promoted her to the rank of Begīm. Very dominant indeed
she became later on; she it was wrought Muḥ. Mūmin Mīrzā’s
death;<a name="FNanchor_1052" id="FNanchor_1052"></a><a href="#Footnote_1052" class="fnanchor">1052</a> she in chief it was caused Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā’s sons to

was a silly chatterer, may also have been a heretic. Of her were
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;169b.</span>born Shāh-i-gharīb Mīrzā and Muz̤affar-i-ḥusain Mīrzā.</p>

<p>Apāq Begīm was another;<a name="FNanchor_1053" id="FNanchor_1053"></a><a href="#Footnote_1053" class="fnanchor">1053</a> she had no children; that Pāpā
Āghācha the Mīrzā made such a favourite of was her foster-sister.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>Being childless, Apāq Begīm brought up as her own the
children of Pāpā Āghācha. She nursed the Mīrzā admirably
when he was ill; none of his other wives could nurse as she did.
The year I came into Hindūstān (932 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>)<a name="FNanchor_1054" id="FNanchor_1054"></a><a href="#Footnote_1054" class="fnanchor">1054</a> she came into Kābul
from Herī and I shewed her all the honour and respect I could.
While I was besieging Chandīrī (934 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>) news came that in
Kābul she had fulfilled God’s will.<a name="FNanchor_1055" id="FNanchor_1055"></a><a href="#Footnote_1055" class="fnanchor">1055</a></p>

<p>One of the Mīrzā’s mistresses was Lat̤īf-sult̤ān Āghācha of the
Chār-shamba people<a name="FNanchor_1056" id="FNanchor_1056"></a><a href="#Footnote_1056" class="fnanchor">1056</a>; she became the mother of Abū’l-muḥsin
Mīrzā and Kūpuk (or Kīpik) Mīrzā (<i>i.e.</i> Muḥammad Muḥsin).</p>

<p>Another mistress was Mīnglī Bībī Āghācha,<a name="FNanchor_1057" id="FNanchor_1057"></a><a href="#Footnote_1057" class="fnanchor">1057</a> an Aūzbeg and
one of Shahr-bānū Begīm’s various people. She became the
mother of Abū-turāb Mīrzā, Muḥammad-i-ḥusain Mīrzā, Farīdūn-i-ḥusain
Mīrzā and of two daughters.</p>

<p>Pāpā Āghācha, the foster-sister of Apāq Begīm was another
mistress. The Mīrzā saw her, looked on her with favour, took
her and, as has been mentioned, she became the mother of five
of his sons and four of his daughters.<a name="FNanchor_1058" id="FNanchor_1058"></a><a href="#Footnote_1058" class="fnanchor">1058</a></p>

<p>Begī Sult̤ān Āghācha was another mistress; she had no child.
There were also many concubines and mistresses held in little
respect; those enumerated were the respected wives and
mistresses of Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā.</p>

<p>Strange indeed it is that of the 14 sons born to a ruler so
great as Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā, one governing too in such a town as
Herī, three only were born in legal marriage.<a name="FNanchor_1059" id="FNanchor_1059"></a><a href="#Footnote_1059" class="fnanchor">1059</a> In him, in his
sons, and in his tribes and hordes vice and debauchery were<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;170.</span>
extremely prevalent. What shews this point precisely is that of
the many sons born to his dynasty not a sign or trace was left
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>in seven or eight years, excepting only Muḥammad-i-zamān
Mīrzā.<a name="FNanchor_1060" id="FNanchor_1060"></a><a href="#Footnote_1060" class="fnanchor">1060</a></p>

<p class="indent">(<i>g. His amīrs.</i>)</p>

<p>There was Muḥammad Barandūq <i>Barlās</i>, descending from
Chākū <i>Barlās</i> as follows,&mdash;Muḥammad Barandūq, son of ‘Alī,
son of Barandūq, son of Jahān-shāh, son of Chākū <i>Barlās</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1061" id="FNanchor_1061"></a><a href="#Footnote_1061" class="fnanchor">1061</a> He
had been a beg of Bābur Mīrzā’s presence; later on Sl. Abū-sa‘īd
Mīrzā favoured him, gave him Kābul conjointly with Jahāngīr
<i>Barlās</i>, and made him Aūlūgh Beg Mīrzā’s guardian. After the
death of Sl. Abū-sa‘īd Mīrzā, Aūlūgh Beg Mīrzā formed designs
against the two Barlās; they got to know this, kept tight hold
of him, made the tribes and hordes march,<a name="FNanchor_1062" id="FNanchor_1062"></a><a href="#Footnote_1062" class="fnanchor">1062</a> moved as for Qūndūz,
and when up on Hindū-kush, courteously compelled Aūlūgh Beg
Mīrzā to start back for Kābul, they themselves going on to
Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā in Khurāsān, who, in his turn, shewed them
great favour. Muḥammad Barandūq was remarkably intelligent,
a very leaderlike man indeed! He was extravagantly fond of
a hawk; so much so, they say, that if a hawk of his had strayed
or had died, he would ask, taking the names of his sons on his
lips, what it would have mattered if such or such a son had died
or had broken his neck, rather than this or that bird had died
or had strayed.</p>

<p>Muz̤affar <i>Barlās</i> was another.<a name="FNanchor_1063" id="FNanchor_1063"></a><a href="#Footnote_1063" class="fnanchor">1063</a> He had been with the Mīrzā
in the guerilla fighting and, for some cause unknown, had received
extreme favour. In such honour was he in those guerilla days
that the compact was for the Mīrzā to take four <i>dāng</i> (sixths)
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;170b.</span>of any country conquered, and for him to take two <i>dāng</i>.
A strange compact indeed! How could it be right to make
even a faithful servant a co-partner in rule? Not even a younger
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>brother or a son obtains such a pact; how then should a beg?<a name="FNanchor_1064" id="FNanchor_1064"></a><a href="#Footnote_1064" class="fnanchor">1064</a>
When the Mīrzā had possession of the throne, he repented the
compact, but his repentance was of no avail; that muddy-minded
mannikin, favoured so much already, made growing assumption
to rule. The Mīrzā acted without judgment; people say
Muz̤affar <i>Barlās</i> was poisoned in the end.<a name="FNanchor_1065" id="FNanchor_1065"></a><a href="#Footnote_1065" class="fnanchor">1065</a> God knows the
truth!</p>

<p>‘Alī-sher <i>Nawā’ī</i> was another, the Mīrzā’s friend rather than
his beg. They had been learners together in childhood and even
then are said to have been close friends. It is not known for
what offence Sl. Abū-sa‘īd Mīrzā drove ‘Alī-sher Beg from Herī;
he then went to Samarkand where he was protected and
supported by Aḥmad Ḥājī Beg during the several years of his
stay.<a name="FNanchor_1066" id="FNanchor_1066"></a><a href="#Footnote_1066" class="fnanchor">1066</a> He was noted for refinement of manner; people fancied
this due to the pride of high fortune but it may not have been
so, it may have been innate, since it was equally noticeable also
in Samarkand.<a name="FNanchor_1067" id="FNanchor_1067"></a><a href="#Footnote_1067" class="fnanchor">1067</a> ‘Alī-sher Beg had no match. For as long as
verse has been written in the Turkī tongue, no-one has written
so much or so well as he. He wrote six books of poems
(mas̤nawī), five of them answering to the Quintet (<i>Khamsah</i>),<a name="FNanchor_1068" id="FNanchor_1068"></a><a href="#Footnote_1068" class="fnanchor">1068</a>
the sixth, entitled the <i>Lisānu’t̤-t̤air</i> (Tongue of the birds), was
in the same metre as the <i>Mant̤iqu’t̤-t̤air</i> (Speech of the birds).<a name="FNanchor_1069" id="FNanchor_1069"></a><a href="#Footnote_1069" class="fnanchor">1069</a>
He put together four <i>dīwāns</i> (collections) of odes, bearing the
names, <i>Curiosities of Childhood</i>, <i>Marvels of Youth</i>, <i>Wonders of
Manhood</i> and <i>Advantages of Age</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1070" id="FNanchor_1070"></a><a href="#Footnote_1070" class="fnanchor">1070</a> There are good quatrains
of his also. Some others of his compositions rank below those<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;171.</span>
mentioned; amongst them is a collection of his letters, imitating
that of Maulānā ‘Abdu’r-raḥmān <i>Jāmī</i> and aiming at gathering
together every letter on any topic he had ever written to any
person. He wrote also the <i>Mīzānu’l-aūzān</i> (Measure of
measures) on prosody; it is very worthless; he has made
mistake in it about the metres of four out of twenty-four
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
quatrains, while about other measures he has made mistake such
as any-one who has given attention to prosody, will understand.
He put a Persian <i>dīwān</i> together also, Fānī (transitory) being
his pen-name for Persian verse.<a name="FNanchor_1071" id="FNanchor_1071"></a><a href="#Footnote_1071" class="fnanchor">1071</a> Some couplets in it are not
bad but for the most part it is flat and poor. In music also he
composed good things (<i>nīma</i>), some excellent airs and preludes
(<i>nakhsh u peshrau</i>). No such patron and protector of men of
parts and accomplishments is known, nor has one such been
heard of as ever appearing. It was through his instruction and
support that Master (Ustād) Qul-i-muḥammad the lutanist,
Shaikhī the flautist, and Ḥusain the lutanist, famous performers
all, rose to eminence and renown. It was through his effort and
supervision that Master Bih-zād and Shāh Muz̤affar became so
distinguished in painting. Few are heard of as having helped
to lay the good foundation for future excellence he helped to lay.
He had neither son nor daughter, wife or family; he let the
world pass by, alone and unencumbered. At first he was Keeper
of the Seal; in middle-life he became a beg and for a time was
Commandant in Astarābād; later on he forsook soldiering. He
took nothing from the Mīrzā, on the contrary, he each year
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;171b.</span>offered considerable gifts. When the Mīrzā was returning from
the Astarābād campaign, ‘Alī-sher Beg went out to give him
meeting; they saw one another but before ‘Alī-sher Beg should
have risen to leave, his condition became such that he could not
rise. He was lifted up and carried away; the doctors could not
tell what was wrong; he went to God’s mercy next day,<a name="FNanchor_1072" id="FNanchor_1072"></a><a href="#Footnote_1072" class="fnanchor">1072</a> one of
his own couplets suiting his case:&mdash;</p>

<p>Aḥmad the son of Tawakkal <i>Barlās</i> was another;<a name="FNanchor_1073" id="FNanchor_1073"></a><a href="#Footnote_1073" class="fnanchor">1073</a> for a time
he held Qandahār.</p>

<p>Walī Beg was another; he was of Ḥājī Saifu’d-dīn Beg’s
line,<a name="FNanchor_1074" id="FNanchor_1074"></a><a href="#Footnote_1074" class="fnanchor">1074</a> and had been one of the Mīrzā’s father’s (Manṣūr’s) great
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>begs.<a name="FNanchor_1075" id="FNanchor_1075"></a><a href="#Footnote_1075" class="fnanchor">1075</a> Short life was granted to him after the Mīrzā took the
throne (973 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>); he died directly afterwards. He was orthodox
and made the Prayers, was rough (<i>turk</i>) and sincere.</p>

<p>Ḥusain of Shaikh Tīmūr was another; he had been favoured and
raised to the rank of beg<a name="FNanchor_1076" id="FNanchor_1076"></a><a href="#Footnote_1076" class="fnanchor">1076</a> by Bābur Mīrzā.</p>

<p>Nuyān Beg was another. He was a Sayyid of Tīrmīẕ on his
father’s side; on his mother’s he was related both to Sl. Abū-sa‘īd
Mīrzā and to Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā.<a name="FNanchor_1077" id="FNanchor_1077"></a><a href="#Footnote_1077" class="fnanchor">1077</a> Sl. Abū-sa‘īd Mīrzā had
favoured him; he was the beg honoured in Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā’s
presence and he met with very great favour when he went to
Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā’s. He was a bragging, easy-going, wine-bibbing,
jolly person. Through being in his father’s service,<a name="FNanchor_1078" id="FNanchor_1078"></a><a href="#Footnote_1078" class="fnanchor">1078</a> Ḥasan of
Ya‘qūb used to be called also Nuyān’s Ḥasan.</p>

<p>Jahāngīr <i>Barlās</i> was another.<a name="FNanchor_1079" id="FNanchor_1079"></a><a href="#Footnote_1079" class="fnanchor">1079</a> For a time he shared the
Kābul command with Muḥammad Barandūq <i>Barlās</i>, later on<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;172.</span>
went to Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā’s presence and received very great
favour. His movements and poses (<i>ḥarakāt u sakanāt</i>) were
graceful and charming; he was also a man of pleasant temper.
As he knew the rules of hunting and hawking, in those matters
the Mīrzā gave him chief charge. He was a favourite of
Badī‘u’z-zamān Mīrzā and, bearing that Mīrzā’s friendliness in
mind, used to praise him.</p>

<p>Mīrzā Aḥmad of ‘Alī <i>Farsī Barlās</i> was another. Though he
wrote no verse, he knew what was poetry. He was a gay-hearted,
elegant person, one by himself.</p>

<p>‘Abdu’l-khalīq Beg was another. Fīrūz Shāh, Shāhrukh Mīrzā’s
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>greatly favoured beg, was his grandfather;<a name="FNanchor_1080" id="FNanchor_1080"></a><a href="#Footnote_1080" class="fnanchor">1080</a> hence people called
him Fīrūz Shāh’s ‘Abdu’l-khalīq. He held Khwārizm for a time.</p>

<p>Ibrāhīm <i>Dūldāī</i> was another. He had good knowledge of
revenue matters and the conduct of public business; his work
was that of a second Muḥ. Barandūq.</p>

<p>Ẕū’n-nūn <i>Arghūn</i> was another.<a name="FNanchor_1081" id="FNanchor_1081"></a><a href="#Footnote_1081" class="fnanchor">1081</a> He was a brave man, using
his sword well in Sl. Abū-sa‘īd Mīrzā’s presence and later on
getting his hand into the work whatever the fight. As to his
courage there was no question at all, but he was a bit of a fool.
After he left our (<i>Mīrān-shāhī</i>) Mīrzās to go to Sl. Ḥusain
Mīrzā, the Mīrzā gave him Ghūr and the Nikdīrīs. He did
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;172b.</span>excellent work in those parts with 70 to 80 men, with so few
beating masses and masses of Hazāras and Nikdīrīs; he had
not his match for keeping those tribes in order. After a while
Zamīn-dāwar was given to him. His son Shāh-i-shujā‘ <i>Arghūn</i>
used to move about with him and even in childhood used to
chop away with his sword. The Mīrzā favoured Shāh-i-shujā‘
and, somewhat against Ẕū’n-nūn Beg’s wishes, joined him with
his father in the government of Qandahār. Later on this father
and son made dissension between that father and that son,<a name="FNanchor_1082" id="FNanchor_1082"></a><a href="#Footnote_1082" class="fnanchor">1082</a> and
stirred up much commotion. After I had overcome Khusrau
Shāh and parted his retainers from him, and after I had taken
Kābul from Ẕū’n-nūn <i>Arghūn</i>’s son Muqīm, Ẕū’n-nūn Beg and
Khusrau Shāh both went, in their helplessness, to see Sl. Ḥusain
Mīrzā. Ẕū’n-nūn <i>Arghūn</i> grew greater after the Mīrzā’s death
when they gave him the districts of the Herī Koh-dāman, such
as Aūba (Ubeh) and Chachcharān.<a name="FNanchor_1083" id="FNanchor_1083"></a><a href="#Footnote_1083" class="fnanchor">1083</a> He was made Lord of
Badī‘u’z-zamān Mīrzā’s Gate<a name="FNanchor_1084" id="FNanchor_1084"></a><a href="#Footnote_1084" class="fnanchor">1084</a> and Muḥammad Barandūq <i>Barlās</i>
Lord of Muz̤affar-i-ḥusain Mīrzā’s, when the two Mīrzās became
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
joint-rulers in Herī. Brave though he was, he was a little crazed
and shallow-pated; if he had not been so, would he have accepted
flattery as he did? would he have made himself so contemptible?
Here are the details of the matter:&mdash;While he was so dominant
and so trusted in Herī, a few shaikhs and mullās went to him
and said, “The Spheres are holding commerce with us; you are
to be styled <i>Hizabru’l-lāh</i> (Lion of God); you will overcome
the Aūzbeg.” Fully accepting this flattery, he put his <i>fūt̤a</i>
(bathing-cloth) round his neck<a name="FNanchor_1085" id="FNanchor_1085"></a><a href="#Footnote_1085" class="fnanchor">1085</a> and gave thanks. Then, after
Shaibāq Khān, coming against the Mīrzās, had beaten them one<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;173.</span>
by one near Bādghīs, Ẕū’n-nūn <i>Arghūn</i> met him face to face
near Qarā-rabāt̤ and, relying on that promise, stood up against
him with 100 to 150 men. A mass of Aūzbegs came up, overcame
them and hustled them off; he himself was taken and put
to death.<a name="FNanchor_1086" id="FNanchor_1086"></a><a href="#Footnote_1086" class="fnanchor">1086</a> He was orthodox and no neglecter of the Prayers,
indeed made the extra ones. He was mad for chess; he played
it according to his own fancy and, if others play with one hand,
he played with both.<a name="FNanchor_1087" id="FNanchor_1087"></a><a href="#Footnote_1087" class="fnanchor">1087</a> Avarice and stinginess ruled in his
character.</p>

<p>Darwīsh-i-‘alī Beg was another,<a name="FNanchor_1088" id="FNanchor_1088"></a><a href="#Footnote_1088" class="fnanchor">1088</a> the younger full-brother of
‘Alī-sher Beg. He had the Balkh Command for a time and
there did good beg-like things, but he was a muddle-head and
somewhat wanting in merit. He was dismissed from the Balkh
Command because his muddle-headedness had hampered the
Mīrzā in his first campaign against Qūndūz and Ḥiṣār. He came
to my presence when I went to Qūndūz in 916 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (1510 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>),
brutalized and stupefied, far from capable begship and out-side
peaceful home-life. Such favour as he had had, he appears to
have had for ‘Alī-sher Beg’s sake.</p>

<p>Mughūl Beg was another. He was Governor of Herī for
a time, later on was given Astarābād, and from there fled to
Ya‘qūb Beg in ‘Irāq. He was of amorous disposition<a name="FNanchor_1089" id="FNanchor_1089"></a><a href="#Footnote_1089" class="fnanchor">1089</a> and an
incessant dicer.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>
<p>Sayyid Badr (Full-moon) was another, a very strong man,
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;173b.</span>graceful in his movements and singularly well-mannered. He
danced wonderfully well, doing one dance quite unique and
seeming to be his own invention.<a name="FNanchor_1090" id="FNanchor_1090"></a><a href="#Footnote_1090" class="fnanchor">1090</a> His whole service was with
the Mīrzā whose comrade he was in wine and social pleasure.</p>

<p>Islīm <i>Barlās</i> was another, a plain (<i>turk</i>) person who understood
hawking well and did some things to perfection. Drawing a bow
of 30 to 40 <i>bātmāns</i> strength,<a name="FNanchor_1091" id="FNanchor_1091"></a><a href="#Footnote_1091" class="fnanchor">1091</a> he would make his shaft pass right
through the target (<i>takhta</i>). In the gallop from the head of the
<i>qabaq-maidān</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1092" id="FNanchor_1092"></a><a href="#Footnote_1092" class="fnanchor">1092</a> he would loosen his bow, string it again, and
then hit the gourd (<i>qabaq</i>). He would tie his string-grip (<i>zih-gīr</i>)
to the one end of a string from 1 to 1-1/2 yards long, fasten the
other end to a tree, let his shaft fly, and shoot through the string-grip
while it revolved.<a name="FNanchor_1093" id="FNanchor_1093"></a><a href="#Footnote_1093" class="fnanchor">1093</a> Many such remarkable feats he did. He
served the Mīrzā continuously and was at every social gathering.</p>

<p>Sl. Junaid <i>Barlās</i> was another;<a name="FNanchor_1094" id="FNanchor_1094"></a><a href="#Footnote_1094" class="fnanchor">1094</a> in his latter days he went to
Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā’s presence.<a name="FNanchor_1095" id="FNanchor_1095"></a><a href="#Footnote_1095" class="fnanchor">1095</a> He is the father of the Sl. Junaid
<i>Barlās</i> on whom at the present time<a name="FNanchor_1096" id="FNanchor_1096"></a><a href="#Footnote_1096" class="fnanchor">1096</a> the joint-government of
Jaunpūr depends.</p>

<p>Shaikh Abū-sa‘īd Khān <i>Dar-miyān</i> (In-between) was another.
It is not known whether he got the name of Dar-miyān because
he took a horse to the Mīrzā <i>in the middle</i> of a fight, or whether
because he put himself <i>in between</i> the Mīrzā and some-one
designing on his life.<a name="FNanchor_1097" id="FNanchor_1097"></a><a href="#Footnote_1097" class="fnanchor">1097</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>
<p>Bih-būd Beg was another. He had served in the pages’ circle
(<i>chuhra jīrgasī</i>) during the guerilla times and gave such<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;174.</span>
satisfaction by his service that the Mīrzā did him the favour of
putting his name on the stamp (<i>tamghā</i>) and the coin (<i>sikka</i>).<a name="FNanchor_1098" id="FNanchor_1098"></a><a href="#Footnote_1098" class="fnanchor">1098</a></p>

<p>Shaikhīm Beg was another.<a name="FNanchor_1099" id="FNanchor_1099"></a><a href="#Footnote_1099" class="fnanchor">1099</a> People used to call him
Shaikhīm <i>Suhailī</i> because Suhailī was his pen-name. He wrote
all sorts of verse, bringing in terrifying words and mental images.
Here is a couplet of his:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">In the anguish of my nights, the whirlpool of my sighs engulphs the firmament;</div>
<div class="line">Like a dragon, the torrent of my tears swallows the quarters of the world.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Well-known it is that when he once recited that couplet in
Maulānā ‘Abdu’r-raḥmān <i>Jāmī’s</i> presence, the honoured Mullā
asked him whether he was reciting verse or frightening people.
He put a <i>dīwān</i> together; <i>mas̤nawīs</i> of his are also in
existence.</p>

<p>Muḥammad-i-walī Beg was another, the son of the Walī Beg
already mentioned. Latterly he became one of the Mīrzā’s
great begs but, great beg though he was, he never neglected his
service and used to recline (<i>yāstānīb</i>) day and night in the Gate.
Through doing this, his free meals and open table were always
set just outside the Gate. Quite certainly a man who was so
constantly in waiting, <i>would</i> receive the favour he received! It
is an evil noticeable today that effort must be made before the
man, dubbed Beg because he has five or six of the bald and blind
at his back, can be got into the Gate at all! Where this sort
of service is, it must be to their own misfortune! Muḥammad-i-walī
Beg’s public table and free meals were good; he kept his
servants neat and well-dressed and with his own hands gave<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;174b.</span>
ample portion to the poor and destitute, but he was foul-mouthed
and evil-spoken. He and also Darwīsh-i-‘alī the librarian were
in my service when I took Samarkand in 917 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (Oct. 1511 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>);
he was palsied then; his talk lacked salt; his former claim to
favour was gone. His assiduous waiting appears to have been
the cause of his promotion.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>
<p>Bābā ‘Alī the Lord of the Gate was another. First, ‘Alī-sher
Beg showed him favour; next, because of his courage, the Mīrzā
took him into service, made him Lord of the Gate, and promoted
him to be a beg. One of his sons is serving me now (<i>circa</i> 934 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>),
that Yūnas of ‘Alī who is a beg, a confidant, and of my household.
He will often be mentioned.<a name="FNanchor_1100" id="FNanchor_1100"></a><a href="#Footnote_1100" class="fnanchor">1100</a></p>

<p>Badru’d-dīn (Full-moon of the Faith) was another. He had
been in the service of Sl. Abū-sa‘īd Mīrzā’s Chief Justice Mīrak
‘Abdu’r-raḥīm; it is said he was very nimble and sure-footed,
a man who could leap over seven horses at once. He and Bābā
‘Alī were close companions.</p>

<p>Ḥasan of ‘Alī <i>Jalāīr</i> was another. His original name was
Ḥusain <i>Jalāīr</i> but he came to be called ‘Alī’s Ḥasan.<a name="FNanchor_1101" id="FNanchor_1101"></a><a href="#Footnote_1101" class="fnanchor">1101</a> His father
‘Alī <i>Jalāīr</i> must have been favoured and made a beg by Bābur
Mīrzā; no man was greater later on when Yādgār-i-muḥammad
M. took Herī. Ḥasan-i-‘alī was Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā’s <i>Qūsh-begī</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1102" id="FNanchor_1102"></a><a href="#Footnote_1102" class="fnanchor">1102</a> He
made T̤ufailī (Uninvited-guest) his pen-name; wrote good odes
and was the Master of this art in his day. He wrote odes on
my name when he came to my presence at the time I took
Samarkand in 917 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (1511 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>). Impudent (<i>bī bāk</i>) and
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;175.</span>prodigal he was, a keeper of catamites, a constant dicer and
draught-player.</p>

<p>Khwāja ‘Abdu’l-lāh <i>Marwārīd</i> (Pearl)<a name="FNanchor_1103" id="FNanchor_1103"></a><a href="#Footnote_1103" class="fnanchor">1103</a> was another; he was
at first Chief Justice but later on became one of the Mīrzā’s
favourite household-begs. He was full of accomplishments; on
the dulcimer he had no equal, and he invented the shake on
the dulcimer; he wrote in several scripts, most beautifully in the
<i>ta‘līq</i>; he composed admirable letters, wrote good verse, with
Bayānī for his pen-name, and was a pleasant companion.
Compared with his other accomplishments, his verse ranks low,
but he knew what was poetry. Vicious and shameless, he became
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>the captive of a sinful disease through his vicious excesses, outlived
his hands and feet, tasted the agonies of varied torture for
several years, and departed from the world under that affliction.<a name="FNanchor_1104" id="FNanchor_1104"></a><a href="#Footnote_1104" class="fnanchor">1104</a></p>

<p>Sayyid Muḥammad-i-aūrūs was another; he was the son of
that Aūrūs (Russian?) <i>Arghūn</i> who, when Sl. Abū-sa‘īd Mīrzā
took the throne, was his beg in chief authority. At that time
there were excellent archer-braves; one of the most distinguished
was Sayyid Muḥammad-i-aūrūs. His bow strong, his shaft long,
he must have been a bold (<i>yūrak</i>) shot and a good one. He was
Commandant in Andikhūd for some time.</p>

<p>Mīr (Qaṃbar-i-)‘alī the Master of the Horse was another. He
it was who, by sending a man to Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā, brought him
down on the defenceless Yādgār-i-muḥammad Mīrzā.</p>

<p>Sayyid Ḥasan <i>Aūghlāqchī</i> was another, a son of Sayyid
<i>Aūghlāqchī</i> and a younger brother of Sayyid Yūsuf Beg.<a name="FNanchor_1105" id="FNanchor_1105"></a><a href="#Footnote_1105" class="fnanchor">1105</a> He
was the father of a capable and accomplished son, named Mīrzā
Farrukh. He had come to my presence before I took Samarkand<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;175b.</span>
in 917 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (1511 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>). Though he had written little verse,
he wrote fairly; he understood the astrolabe and astronomy well,
was excellent company, his talk good too, but he was rather
a bad drinker (<i>bad shrāb</i>). He died in the fight at Ghaj-dawān.<a name="FNanchor_1106" id="FNanchor_1106"></a><a href="#Footnote_1106" class="fnanchor">1106</a></p>

<p>Tīngrī-bīrdī the storekeeper (<i>sāmānchī</i>) was another; he was
a plain (<i>turk</i>), bold, sword-slashing brave. As has been said,
he charged out of the Gate of Balkh on Khusrau Shāh’s great
retainer Naz̤ar Bahādur and overcame him (903 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>).</p>

<p>There were a few Turkmān braves also who were received
with great favour when they came to the Mīrzā’s presence. One
of the first to come was ‘Alī Khān <i>Bāyandar</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1107" id="FNanchor_1107"></a><a href="#Footnote_1107" class="fnanchor">1107</a> Asad Beg and
Taham-tan (Strong-bodied) Beg were others, an elder and
younger brother these; Badī‘u’z-zamān Mīrzā took Taham-tan
Beg’s daughter and by her had Muḥammad-i-zamān Mīrzā.
Mīr ‘Umar Beg was another; later on he was in Badī‘u’z-zamān
Mīrzā’s service; he was a brave, plain, excellent person. His
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>son, Abū’l-fatḥ by name, came from ‘Irāq to my presence,
a very soft, unsteady and feeble person; such a son from such
a father!</p>

<p>Of those who came into Khurāsān after Shāh Ismā‘īl took
‘Irāq and Aẕarbāījān (<i>circa</i> 906 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1500 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>), one was ‘Abdu’l-bāqī
Mīrzā of Tīmūr Beg’s line. He was a Mīrān-shāhī<a name="FNanchor_1108" id="FNanchor_1108"></a><a href="#Footnote_1108" class="fnanchor">1108</a> whose
ancestors will have gone long before into those parts, put thought
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;176.</span>of sovereignty out of their heads, served those ruling there, and
from them have received favour. That Tīmūr ‘Us̤mān who was
the great, trusted beg of Ya‘qūb Beg (<i>White-sheep Turkmān</i>)
and who had once even thought of sending against Khurāsān
the mass of men he had gathered to himself, must have been
this ‘Abdu’l-bāqī Mīrzā’s paternal-uncle. Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā took
‘Abdu’l-bāqī Mīrzā at once into favour, making him a son-in-law

a village in Andijān and appears to have made claim to be
a sayyid (<i>mutasayyid</i>). He was a very agreeable companion,
pleasant of temper and speech. His were the judgment and
rulings that carried weight amongst men of letters and poets of
Khurāsān. He wasted his time by composing, in imitation of
the story of Amīr Ḥamza,<a name="FNanchor_1111" id="FNanchor_1111"></a><a href="#Footnote_1111" class="fnanchor">1111</a> a work which is one long, far-fetched

not a Ṣūfī, he was mystical.<a name="FNanchor_1113" id="FNanchor_1113"></a><a href="#Footnote_1113" class="fnanchor">1113</a> Such mystics as he will have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>gathered in ‘Alī-sher Beg’s presence and there have gone into
their raptures and ecstacies. Kamālu’d-dīn will have been
better-born than most of them; his promotion will have been
due to his good birth, since he had no other merit to speak of.<a name="FNanchor_1114" id="FNanchor_1114"></a><a href="#Footnote_1114" class="fnanchor">1114</a>
A production of his exists, under the name <i>Majālisu’l-‘ushshāq</i>
(Assemblies of lovers), the authorship of which he ascribes (in
its preface) to Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā.<a name="FNanchor_1115" id="FNanchor_1115"></a><a href="#Footnote_1115" class="fnanchor">1115</a> It is mostly a lie and a tasteless
lie. He has written such irreverent things in it that some<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;176b.</span>
of them cast doubt upon his orthodoxy; for example, he
represents the Prophets,&mdash;Peace be on them,&mdash;and Saints as
subject to earthly passion, and gives to each a minion and
a mistress. Another and singularly absurd thing is that, although
in his preface he says, “This is Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā’s own written
word and literary composition,” he, never-the-less, enters, in the
body of the book, “All by the sub-signed author”, at the head
of odes and verses well-known to be his own. It was his flattery
gave Ẕū’n-nūn <i>Arghūn</i> the title Lion of God.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>i. His wazīrs.</i>)</p>

<p>One was Majdu’d-dīn Muḥammad, son of Khwāja Pīr Aḥmad
of Khwāf, the one man (<i>yak-qalam</i>) of Shāhrukh Mīrzā’s
Finance-office.<a name="FNanchor_1116" id="FNanchor_1116"></a><a href="#Footnote_1116" class="fnanchor">1116</a> In Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā’s Finance-office there was
not at first proper order or method; waste and extravagance
resulted; the peasant did not prosper, and the soldier was not
satisfied. Once while Majdu’d-dīn Muḥammad was still <i>parwānchī</i><a name="FNanchor_1117" id="FNanchor_1117"></a><a href="#Footnote_1117" class="fnanchor">1117</a>
and styled Mīrak (Little Mīr), it became a matter of
importance to the Mīrzā to have some money; when he asked
the Finance-officials for it, they said none had been collected and
that there was none. Majdu’d-dīn Muḥammad must have heard
this and have smiled, for the Mīrzā asked him why he smiled;
privacy was made and he told Mīrzā what was in his mind.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>Said he, “If the honoured Mīrzā will pledge himself to strengthen
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;177.</span>my hands by not opposing my orders, it shall so be before long
that the country shall prosper, the peasant be content, the soldier
well-off, and the Treasury full.” The Mīrzā for his part gave
the pledge desired, put Majdu’d-dīn Muḥammad in authority
throughout Khurāsān, and entrusted all public business to him.
He in his turn by using all possible diligence and effort, before
long had made soldier and peasant grateful and content, filled
the Treasury to abundance, and made the districts habitable
and cultivated. He did all this however in face of opposition
from the begs and men high in place, all being led by ‘Alī-sher
Beg, all out of temper with what Majdu’d-dīn Muḥammad had
effected. By their effort and evil suggestion he was arrested
and dismissed.<a name="FNanchor_1118" id="FNanchor_1118"></a><a href="#Footnote_1118" class="fnanchor">1118</a> In succession to him Niz̤āmu’l-mulk of Khwāf
was made Dīwān but in a short time they got him arrested also,
and him they got put to death.<a name="FNanchor_1119" id="FNanchor_1119"></a><a href="#Footnote_1119" class="fnanchor">1119</a> They then brought Khwāja
Afẓal out of ‘Irāq and made him Dīwān; he had just been
made a beg when I came to Kābul (910 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>), and he also
impressed the Seal in Dīwān.</p>

<p>Khwāja ‘Atā<a name="FNanchor_1120" id="FNanchor_1120"></a><a href="#Footnote_1120" class="fnanchor">1120</a> was another; although, unlike those already
mentioned, he was not in high office or Finance-minister (<i>dīwān</i>),
nothing was settled without his concurrence the whole Khura-sānāt
over. He was a pious, praying, upright (<i>mutadaiyin</i>)
person; he must have been diligent in business also.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>j. Others of the Court.</i>)</p>

<p>Those enumerated were Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā’s retainers and
followers.<a name="FNanchor_1121" id="FNanchor_1121"></a><a href="#Footnote_1121" class="fnanchor">1121</a> His was a wonderful Age; in it Khurāsān, and<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;177b.</span>
Herī above all, was full of learned and matchless men. Whatever
the work a man took up, he aimed and aspired at bringing
that work to perfection. One such man was Maulānā ‘Abdu’r-raḥmān
<i>Jāmī</i>, who was unrivalled in his day for esoteric and
exoteric knowledge. Famous indeed are his poems! The
Mullā’s dignity it is out of my power to describe; it has occurred
to me merely to mention his honoured name and one atom of
his excellence, as a benediction and good omen for this part of
my humble book.</p>

<p>Shaikhu’l-islām Saifu’d-dīn Aḥmad was another. He was of
the line of that Mullā Sa‘du’d-dīn (Mas‘ūd) <i>Taftazānī</i><a name="FNanchor_1122" id="FNanchor_1122"></a><a href="#Footnote_1122" class="fnanchor">1122</a> whose
descendants from his time downwards have given the Shaikhu’l-islām
to Khurāsān. He was a very learned man, admirably
versed in the Arabian sciences<a name="FNanchor_1123" id="FNanchor_1123"></a><a href="#Footnote_1123" class="fnanchor">1123</a> and the Traditions, most God-fearing
and orthodox. Himself a Shafi‘ī,<a name="FNanchor_1124" id="FNanchor_1124"></a><a href="#Footnote_1124" class="fnanchor">1124</a> he was tolerant of all
the sects. People say he never once in 70 years omitted the
Congregational Prayer. He was martyred when Shāh Ismā‘īl
took Herī (916 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>); there now remains no man of his
honoured line.<a name="FNanchor_1125" id="FNanchor_1125"></a><a href="#Footnote_1125" class="fnanchor">1125</a></p>

<p>Maulānā Shaikh Ḥusain was another; he is mentioned here,
although his first appearance and his promotion were under
Sl. Abū-sa‘īd Mīrzā, because he was living still under Sl. Ḥusain<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;178.</span>
Mīrzā. Being well-versed in the sciences of philosophy, logic
and rhetoric, he was able to find much meaning in a few words
and to bring it out opportunely in conversation. Being very
intimate and influential with Sl. Abū-sa‘īd Mīrzā, he took part
in all momentous affairs of the Mīrzā’s dominions; there was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>no better <i>muḥtasib</i><a name="FNanchor_1126" id="FNanchor_1126"></a><a href="#Footnote_1126" class="fnanchor">1126</a>; this will have been why he was so much
trusted. Because he had been an intimate of that Mīrzā, the
incomparable man was treated with insult in Sl. Ḥusain
Mīrzā’s time.</p>

<p>Mullā-zāda Mullā ‘Us̤mān was another. He was a native of
Chīrkh, in the Luhūgur <i>tūmān</i> of the <i>tūmān</i> of Kābul<a name="FNanchor_1127" id="FNanchor_1127"></a><a href="#Footnote_1127" class="fnanchor">1127</a> and was
called the Born Mullā (<i>Mullā-zāda</i>) because in Aūlūgh Beg
Mīrzā’s time he used to give lessons when 14 years old. He went
to Herī on his way from Samarkand to make the circuit of the
<i>ka‘ba</i>, was there stopped, and made to remain by Sl. Ḥusain
Mīrzā. He was very learned, the most so of his time. People
say he was nearing the rank of Ijtihād<a name="FNanchor_1128" id="FNanchor_1128"></a><a href="#Footnote_1128" class="fnanchor">1128</a> but he did not reach it.
It is said of him that he once asked, “How should a person
forget a thing heard?” A strong memory he must have had!</p>

<p>Mīr Jamālu’d-dīn the Traditionalist<a name="FNanchor_1129" id="FNanchor_1129"></a><a href="#Footnote_1129" class="fnanchor">1129</a> was another. He had no
equal in Khurāsān for knowledge of the Muḥammadan Traditions.
He was advanced in years and is still alive (934 to 937 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>).</p>

<p>Mīr Murtāẓ was another. He was well-versed in the sciences
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;178b.</span>of philosophy and metaphysics; he was called <i>murtāẓ</i> (ascetic)
because he fasted a great deal. He was madly fond of chess,
so much so that if he had met two players, he would hold one
by the skirt while he played his game out with the other, as
much as to say, “Don’t go!”</p>

<p>Mīr Mas‘ūd of Sherwān was another.<a name="FNanchor_1130" id="FNanchor_1130"></a><a href="#Footnote_1130" class="fnanchor">1130</a></p>

<p>Mīr ‘Abdu’l-ghafūr of Lār was another. Disciple and pupil
both of Maulānā ‘Abdu’r-raḥmān <i>Jāmī</i>, he had read aloud most
of the Mullā’s poems (<i>mas̤nawī</i>) in his presence, and wrote
a plain exposition of the <i>Nafaḥāt</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1131" id="FNanchor_1131"></a><a href="#Footnote_1131" class="fnanchor">1131</a> He had good acquaintance
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>with the exoteric sciences, and in the esoteric ones also was very
successful. He was a curiously casual and unceremonious
person; no person styled Mullā by any-one soever was debarred
from submitting a (Qorān) chapter to him for exposition; moreover
whatever the place in which he heard there was a darwīsh,
he had no rest till he had reached that darwīsh’s presence. He
was ill when I was in Khurāsān (912 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>); I went to enquire
for him where he lay in the Mullā’s College,<a name="FNanchor_1132" id="FNanchor_1132"></a><a href="#Footnote_1132" class="fnanchor">1132</a> after I had made
the circuit of the Mullā’s tomb. He died a few days later, of
that same illness.</p>

<p>Mīr ‘Atā’u’l-lāh of Mashhad was another.<a name="FNanchor_1133" id="FNanchor_1133"></a><a href="#Footnote_1133" class="fnanchor">1133</a> He knew the
Arabian sciences well and also wrote a Persian treatise on rhyme.
That treatise is well-done but it has the defect that he brings
into it, as his examples, couplets of his own and, assuming them<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;179.</span>
to be correct, prefixes to each, “As must be observed in the
following couplet by your slave” (<i>banda</i>). Several rivals of his
find deserved comment in this treatise. He wrote another on
the curiosities of verse, entitled <i>Badāi‘u’s-sanāi</i>; a very well-written
treatise. He may have swerved from the Faith.</p>

<p>Qāẓī Ikhtiyār was another. He was an excellent Qāẓī and
wrote a treatise in Persian on Jurisprudence, an admirable
treatise; he also, in order to give elucidation (<i>iqtibās</i>), made
a collection of homonymous verses from the Qorān. He came
with Muḥammad-i-yūsuf to see me at the time I met the Mīrzās
on the Murgh-āb (912 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>). Talk turning on the Bāburī script,<a name="FNanchor_1134" id="FNanchor_1134"></a><a href="#Footnote_1134" class="fnanchor">1134</a>
he asked me about it, letter by letter; I wrote it out, letter by
letter; he went through it, letter by letter, and having learned
its plan, wrote something in it there and then.</p>

<p>Mīr Muḥammad-i-yūsuf was another; he was a pupil of the
Shaikhu’l-islām<a name="FNanchor_1135" id="FNanchor_1135"></a><a href="#Footnote_1135" class="fnanchor">1135</a> and afterwards was advanced to his place.
In some assemblies he, in others, Qāẓī Ikhtiyār took the
higher place. Towards the end of his life he was so infatuated
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>with soldiering and military command, that except of those two
tasks, what could be learned from his conversation? what known
from his pen? Though he failed in both, those two ambitions
ended by giving to the winds his goods and his life, his house
and his home. He may have been a Shī‘a.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>k. The Poets.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;179b.</span>The all-surpassing head of the poet-band was Maulānā
‘Abdu’r-raḥmān <i>Jāmī</i>. Others were Shaikhīm Suhailī and Ḥasan
of ‘Alī <i>Jalāīr</i><a name="FNanchor_1136" id="FNanchor_1136"></a><a href="#Footnote_1136" class="fnanchor">1136</a> whose names have been mentioned already as in
the circle of the Mīrzā’s begs and household.</p>

<p>Āṣafī was another,<a name="FNanchor_1137" id="FNanchor_1137"></a><a href="#Footnote_1137" class="fnanchor">1137</a> he taking Āṣafī for his pen-name because
he was a wazīr’s son. His verse does not want for grace or
sentiment, but has no merit through passion and ecstacy. He
himself made the claim, “I have never packed up (<i>būlmādī</i>) my
odes to make the oasis (<i>wādī</i>) of a collection.”<a name="FNanchor_1138" id="FNanchor_1138"></a><a href="#Footnote_1138" class="fnanchor">1138</a> This was
affectation, his younger brothers and his intimates having
collected his odes. He wrote little else but odes. He waited
on me when I went into Khurāsān (912 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>).</p>

<p>Banā’i was another; he was a native of Herī and took such
a pen-name (Banā’i) on account of his father Ustād Muḥammad
<i>Sabz-banā</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1139" id="FNanchor_1139"></a><a href="#Footnote_1139" class="fnanchor">1139</a> His odes have grace and ecstacy. One poem
(<i>mas̤nawī</i>) of his on the topic of fruits, is in the <i>mutaqārib</i><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">measure;<a name="FNanchor_1140" id="FNanchor_1140"></a><a href="#Footnote_1140" class="fnanchor">1140</a> it is random and not worked up. Another short</span><br />
poem is in the <i>khafīf</i> measure, so also is a longer one finished
towards the end of his life. He will have known nothing of
music in his young days and ‘Alī-sher Beg seems to have taunted
him about it, so one winter when the Mīrzā, taking ‘Alī-sher Beg
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>with him, went to winter in Merv, Banā’i stayed behind in Herī
and so applied himself to study music that before the heats he
had composed several works. These he played and sang, airs
with variations, when the Mīrzā came back to Herī in the heats.<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;180.</span>
All amazed, ‘Alī-sher Beg praised him. His musical compositions
are perfect; one was an air known as <i>Nuh-rang</i> (Nine modulations),
and having both the theme (<i>tūkānash</i>) and the variation
(<i>yīla</i>) on the note called <i>rāst</i>(?). Banā’i was ‘Alī-sher Beg’s
rival; it will have been on this account he was so much ill-treated.
When at last he could bear it no longer, he went into Aẕarbāījān
and ‘Irāq to the presence of Ya’qūb Beg; he did not remain however
in those parts after Ya‘qūb Beg’s death (896 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1491 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>)
but went back to Herī, just the same with his jokes and retorts.
Here is one of them:&mdash;‘Alī-sher at a chess-party in stretching
his leg touched Banā’i on the hinder-parts and said jestingly,
“It is the sad nuisance of Herī that a man can’t stretch his leg
without its touching a poet’s backside.” “Nor draw it up again,”
retorted Banā’i.<a name="FNanchor_1141" id="FNanchor_1141"></a><a href="#Footnote_1141" class="fnanchor">1141</a> In the end the upshot of his jesting was that
he had to leave Herī again; he went then to Samarkand.<a name="FNanchor_1142" id="FNanchor_1142"></a><a href="#Footnote_1142" class="fnanchor">1142</a>
A great many good new things used to be made for ‘Alī-sher
Beg, so whenever any-one produced a novelty, he called it ‘Alī-sher’s
in order to give it credit and vogue.<a name="FNanchor_1143" id="FNanchor_1143"></a><a href="#Footnote_1143" class="fnanchor">1143</a> Some things were
called after him in compliment <i>e.g.</i> because when he had ear-ache,
he wrapped his head up in one of the blue triangular kerchiefs
women tie over their heads in winter, that kerchief was called
‘Alī-sher’s comforter. Then again, Banā’i when he had decided
to leave Herī, ordered a quite new kind of pad for his ass and<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;180b.</span>
dubbed it ‘Alī-sher’s.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>
<p>Maulānā Saifī of Bukhārā was another;<a name="FNanchor_1144" id="FNanchor_1144"></a><a href="#Footnote_1144" class="fnanchor">1144</a> he was a Mullā
complete<a name="FNanchor_1145" id="FNanchor_1145"></a><a href="#Footnote_1145" class="fnanchor">1145</a> who in proof of his mullā-ship used to give a list of
the books he had read. He put two <i>dīwāns</i> together, one being
for the use of tradesmen (<i>ḥarfa-kar</i>), and he also wrote many
fables. That he wrote no <i>mas̤nawī</i> is shewn by the following
quatrain:&mdash;</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>A Persian prosody he wrote is at once brief and prolix, brief in
the sense of omitting things that should be included, and prolix in
the sense that plain and simple matters are detailed down to the
diacritical points, down even to their Arabic points.<a name="FNanchor_1147" id="FNanchor_1147"></a><a href="#Footnote_1147" class="fnanchor">1147</a> He is said
to have been a great drinker, a bad drinker, and a mightily strong-fisted
man.</p>

<p>‘Abdu’l-lāh the <i>mas̤nawī</i>-writer was another.<a name="FNanchor_1148" id="FNanchor_1148"></a><a href="#Footnote_1148" class="fnanchor">1148</a> He was from
Jām and was the Mullā’s sister’s son. Hātifī was his pen-name.
He wrote poems (<i>mas̤nawī</i>) in emulation of the Two Quintets,<a name="FNanchor_1149" id="FNanchor_1149"></a><a href="#Footnote_1149" class="fnanchor">1149</a>
and called them <i>Haft-manẕar</i> (Seven-faces) in imitation of the
<i>Haft-paikar</i> (Seven-faces). In emulation of the <i>Sikandar-nāma</i>
he composed the <i>Tīmūr-nāma</i>. His most renowned <i>mas̤nawī</i> is
<i>Laila and Majnūn</i>, but its reputation is greater than its charm.</p>

<p>Mīr Ḥusain the Enigmatist<a name="FNanchor_1150" id="FNanchor_1150"></a><a href="#Footnote_1150" class="fnanchor">1150</a> was another. He seems to have
had no equal in making riddles, to have given his whole time to
it, and to have been a curiously humble, disconsolate (<i>nā-murād</i>)
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;181.</span>and harmless (<i>bī-bad</i>) person.</p>

<p>Mīr Muḥammad <i>Badakhshī</i> of Ishkīmīsh was another. As
Ishkīmīsh is not in Badakhshān, it is odd he should have made it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>his pen-name. His verse does not rank with that of the poets
previously mentioned,<a name="FNanchor_1151" id="FNanchor_1151"></a><a href="#Footnote_1151" class="fnanchor">1151</a> and though he wrote a treatise on riddles,
his riddles are not first-rate. He was a very pleasant companion;
he waited on me in Samarkand (917 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>).</p>

<p>Yūsuf the wonderful (<i>badī</i>)<a name="FNanchor_1152" id="FNanchor_1152"></a><a href="#Footnote_1152" class="fnanchor">1152</a> was another. He was from the
Farghāna country; his odes are said not to be bad.</p>

<p>Āhī was another, a good ode-writer, latterly in Ibn-i-ḥusain
Mīrzā’s service, and <i>ṣāḥib-i-dīwān</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1153" id="FNanchor_1153"></a><a href="#Footnote_1153" class="fnanchor">1153</a></p>

than correct. There is Turkī verse of his also, not
badly written. He went to Shaibāq Khān later on and found
complete favour. He wrote a Turkī poem (<i>mas̤nawī</i>), named
from Shaibāq Khān, in the <i>raml masaddas majnūn</i> measure, that is
to say the metre of the <i>Subḥat</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1155" id="FNanchor_1155"></a><a href="#Footnote_1155" class="fnanchor">1155</a> It is feeble and flat; Muḥammad

a <i>dīwān</i> together.</p>

many couplets are, the basis and purport are hollow and bad.
Ancient poets when writing of love and the lover, have represented
the lover as a man and the beloved as a woman; but Hilālī has
made the lover a darwīsh, the beloved a king, with the result
that the couplets containing the king’s acts and words, set him
forth as shameless and abominable. It is an extreme effrontery
in Hilālī that for a poem’s sake he should describe a young man
and that young man a king, as resembling the shameless and
immoral.<a name="FNanchor_1162" id="FNanchor_1162"></a><a href="#Footnote_1162" class="fnanchor">1162</a> It is heard-said that Hilālī had a very retentive

<p>Ahlī<a name="FNanchor_1163" id="FNanchor_1163"></a><a href="#Footnote_1163" class="fnanchor">1163</a> was another; he was of the common people (<i>‘āmī</i>),

<p class="indent">(<i>l. Artists.</i>)</p>

<p>Of fine pen-men there were many; the one standing-out in

the Mīrzā and for ‘Alī-sher Beg, writing daily 30 couplets for
the first, 20 for the second.</p>

<p>Of the painters, one was Bih-zād.<a name="FNanchor_1165" id="FNanchor_1165"></a><a href="#Footnote_1165" class="fnanchor">1165</a> His work was very dainty
but he did not draw beardless faces well; he used greatly to
lengthen the double chin (<i>ghab-ghab</i>); bearded faces he drew
admirably.</p>

<p>Shāh Muz̤affar was another; he painted dainty portraits,<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;182.</span>
representing the hair very daintily.<a name="FNanchor_1166" id="FNanchor_1166"></a><a href="#Footnote_1166" class="fnanchor">1166</a> Short life was granted
him; he left the world when on his upward way to fame.</p>

<p>Of musicians, as has been said, no-one played the dulcimer
so well as Khwāja ‘Abdu’l-lāh <i>Marwārīd</i>.</p>

<p>Qul-i-muḥammad the lutanist (<i>‘aūdī</i>) was another; he also
played the guitar (<i>ghichak</i>) beautifully and added three strings
to it. For many and good preludes (<i>peshrau</i>) he had not his
equal amongst composers or performers, but this is only true of
his preludes.</p>

<p>Shaikhī the flautist (<i>nāyī</i>) was another; it is said he played
also the lute and the guitar, and that he had played the flute
from his 12th or 13th year. He once produced a wonderful air
on the flute, at one of Badī‘u’z-zamān Mīrzā’s assemblies; Qul-i-muḥammad
could not reproduce it on the guitar, so declared
this a worthless instrument; Shaikhī <i>Nāyī</i> at once took the
guitar from Qul-i-muḥammad’s hands and played the air on it,
well and in perfect tune. They say he was so expert in music
that having once heard an air, he was able to say, “This or that
is the tune of so-and-so’s or so-and-so’s flute.”<a name="FNanchor_1167" id="FNanchor_1167"></a><a href="#Footnote_1167" class="fnanchor">1167</a> He composed
few works; one or two airs are heard of.</p>

<p>Shāh Qulī the guitar-player was another; he was of ‘Irāq, came
into Khurāsān, practised playing, and succeeded. He composed
many airs, preludes and works (<i>nakhsh, peshrau u aīshlār</i>).</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span></p>
<p>Ḥusain the lutanist was another; he composed and played
with taste; he would twist the strings of his lute into one and
play on that. His fault was affectation about playing. He
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;182b.</span>made a fuss once when Shaibāq Khān ordered him to play, and
not only played badly but on a worthless instrument he had
brought in place of his own. The Khān saw through him at
once and ordered him to be well beaten on the neck, there and
then. This was the one good action Shaibāq Khān did in the
world; it was well-done truly! a worse chastisement is the due
of such affected mannikins!</p>

<p>Ghulām-i-shādī (Slave of Festivity), the son of Shādī the
reciter, was another of the musicians. Though he performed,
he did it less well than those of the circle just described. There
are excellent themes (<i>ṣūt</i>) and beautiful airs (<i>nakhsh</i>) of his;
no-one in his day composed such airs and themes. In the end
Shaibāq Khān sent him to the Qāzān Khān, Muḥammad Amīn;
no further news has been heard of him.</p>

<p>Mīr Azū was another composer, not a performer; he produced
few works but those few were in good taste.</p>

<p>Banā’i was also a musical composer; there are excellent airs
and themes of his.</p>

<p>An unrivalled man was the wrestler Muḥammad Bū-sa‘īd;
he was foremost amongst the wrestlers, wrote verse too, composed
themes and airs, one excellent air of his being in <i>chār-gāh</i>
(four-time),&mdash;and he was pleasant company. It is extraordinary
that such accomplishments as his should be combined with
wrestling.<a name="FNanchor_1168" id="FNanchor_1168"></a><a href="#Footnote_1168" class="fnanchor">1168</a></p>

<p class="center">HISTORICAL NARRATIVE RESUMED.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>a. Burial of Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā.</i>)</p>

<p>At the time Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā took his departure from the
world, there were present of the Mīrzās only Badī’u’z-zamān
Mīrzā and Muz̤affar-i-ḥusain Mīrzā. The latter had been his
father’s favourite son; his leading beg was Muḥammad Barandūq
<i>Barlās</i>; his mother Khadīja Begīm had been the Mīrzā’s most
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>influential wife; and to him the Mīrzā’s people had gathered.<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;183.</span>
For these reasons Badī‘u’z-zamān Mīrzā had anxieties and
thought of not coming,<a name="FNanchor_1169" id="FNanchor_1169"></a><a href="#Footnote_1169" class="fnanchor">1169</a> but Muz̤affar-i-ḥusain Mīrzā and Muḥammad
Barandūq Beg themselves rode out, dispelled his fears
and brought him in.</p>

<p>Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā was carried into Herī and there buried in
his own College with royal rites and ceremonies.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>b. A dual succession.</i>)</p>

<p>At this crisis Ẕū’n-nūn Beg was also present. He, Muḥ.
Barandūq Beg, the late Mīrzā’s begs and those of the two (young)
Mīrzās having assembled, decided to make the two Mīrzās
joint-rulers in Herī. Ẕū’n-nūn Beg was to have control in
Badī‘u’z-zamān Mīrzā’s Gate, Muḥ. Barandūq Beg, in Muz̤affar-i-ḥusain
Mīrzā’s. Shaikh ‘Alī T̤aghāī was to be <i>dārogha</i> in Herī
for the first, Yūsuf-i-‘alī for the second. Theirs was a strange
plan! Partnership in rule is a thing unheard of; against it
stand Shaikh Sa’dī’s words in the Gulistān:&mdash;“Ten darwishes
sleep under a blanket (<i>gilīm</i>); two kings find no room in
a clime” (<i>aqlīm</i>).<a name="FNanchor_1170" id="FNanchor_1170"></a><a href="#Footnote_1170" class="fnanchor">1170</a></p>

<p class="indent">(<i>a. Bābur starts to join Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā.</i>)</p>

<p>In the month of Muḥarram we set out by way of Ghūr-bund
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;183b.</span>and Shibr-tū to oppose the Aūzbeg.</p>

<p>As Jahāngīr Mīrzā had gone out of the country in some sort
of displeasure, we said, “There might come much mischief and
trouble if he drew the clans (<i>aīmāq</i>) to himself;” and “What
trouble might come of it!” and, “First let’s get the clans in
hand!” So said, we hurried forward, riding light and leaving
the baggage (<i>aūrūq</i>) at Ushtur-shahr in charge of Walī the
treasurer and Daulat-qadam of the scouts. That day we reached
Fort Ẓaḥāq; from there we crossed the pass of the Little-dome
(Guṃbazak-kūtal), trampled through Sāīghān, went over the
Dandān-shikan pass and dismounted in the meadow of Kāhmard.
From Kāhmard we sent Sayyid Afẓal the Seer-of-dreams
(<i>Khwāb-bīn</i>) and Sl. Muḥammad <i>Dūldāī</i> to Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā
with a letter giving the particulars of our start from Kābul.<a name="FNanchor_1172" id="FNanchor_1172"></a><a href="#Footnote_1172" class="fnanchor">1172</a></p>

<p>Jahāngīr Mīrzā must have lagged on the road, for when he
got opposite Bāmīān and went with 20 or 30 persons to visit it,
he saw near it the tents of our people left with the baggage.
Thinking we were there, he and his party hurried back to their
camp and, without an eye to anything, without regard for their
own people marching in the rear, made off for Yaka-aūlāng.<a name="FNanchor_1173" id="FNanchor_1173"></a><a href="#Footnote_1173" class="fnanchor">1173</a></p>

<p class="indent">(<i>b. Action of Shaibāq Khān.</i>)</p>

<p>When Shaibāq Khān had laid siege to Balkh, in which was
Sl. Qul-i-nachāq,<a name="FNanchor_1174" id="FNanchor_1174"></a><a href="#Footnote_1174" class="fnanchor">1174</a> he sent two or three sult̤āns with 3 or 4000
men to overrun Badakhshān. At the time Mubārak Shāh and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>Zubair had again joined Nāṣir Mīrzā, spite of former resentments
and bickerings, and they all were lying at Shakdān, below Kishm<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;184.</span>
and east of the Kishm-water. Moving through the night, one
body of Aūzbegs crossed that water at the top of the morning
and advanced on the Mīrzā; he at once drew off to rising-ground,
mustered his force, sounded trumpets, met and overcame them.
Behind the Aūzbegs was the Kishm-water in flood, many were
drowned in it, a mass of them died by arrow and sword, more
were made prisoner. Another body of Aūzbegs, sent against
Mubārak Shāh and Zubair where they lay, higher up the water
and nearer Kishm, made them retire to the rising-ground. Of this
the Mīrzā heard; when he had beaten off his own assailants, he
moved against theirs. So did the Kohistān begs, gathered with
horse and foot, still higher up the river. Unable to make stand
against this attack, the Aūzbegs fled, but of this body also a mass
died by sword, arrow, and water. In all some 1000 to 1500 may
have died. This was Nāṣir Mīrzā’s one good success; a man of
his brought us news about it while we were in the dale of Kāhmard.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>c. Bābur moves on into Khurāsān.</i>)</p>

<p>While we were in Kāhmard, our army fetched corn from
Ghūrī and Dahāna. There too we had letters from Sayyid<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;184b.</span>
Afẓal and Sl. Muḥammad <i>Dūldāī</i> whom we had sent into
Khurāsān; their news was of Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā’s death.</p>

<p>This news notwithstanding, we set forward for Khurāsān;
though there were other grounds for doing this, what decided
us was anxious thought for the reputation of this (Tīmūrid)
dynasty. We went up the trough (<i>aīchī</i>) of the Ājar-valley, on
over Tūp and Mandaghān, crossed the Balkh-water and came
out on Ṣāf-hill. Hearing there that Aūzbegs were overrunning
Sān and Chār-yak,<a name="FNanchor_1175" id="FNanchor_1175"></a><a href="#Footnote_1175" class="fnanchor">1175</a> we sent a force under Qāsim Beg against
them; he got up with them, beat them well, cut many heads
off, and returned.</p>

<p>We lay a few days in the meadow of Ṣāf-hill, waiting for
news of Jahāngīr Mīrzā and the clans (<i>aīmāq</i>) to whom persons
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>had been sent. We hunted once, those hills being very full of
wild sheep and goats (<i>kiyīk</i>). All the clans came in and waited
on me within a few days; it was to me they came; they had
not gone to Jahāngīr Mīrzā though he had sent men often
enough to them, once sending even ‘Imādu’d-dīn Mas‘ūd. He
himself was forced to come at last; he saw me at the foot of
the valley when I came down off Ṣāf-hill. Being anxious about
Khurāsān, we neither paid him attention nor took thought for
the clans, but went right on through Gurzwān, Almār, Qaiṣār,
Chīchīk-tū, and Fakhru’d-dīn’s-death (<i>aūlūm</i>) into the Bām-valley,
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;185.</span>one of the dependencies of Bādghīs.</p>

<p>The world being full of divisions,<a name="FNanchor_1176" id="FNanchor_1176"></a><a href="#Footnote_1176" class="fnanchor">1176</a> things were being taken
from country and people with the long arm; we ourselves began
to take something, by laying an impost on the Turks and clans
of those parts, in two or three months taking perhaps 300 <i>tūmāns</i>
of <i>kipkī</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1177" id="FNanchor_1177"></a><a href="#Footnote_1177" class="fnanchor">1177</a></p>

<p class="indent">(<i>d. Coalition of the Khurāsān Mīrzās.</i>)</p>

<p>A few days before our arrival (in Bām-valley?) some of the
Khurāsān light troops and of Ẕū’n-nūn Beg’s men had well
beaten Aūzbeg raiders in Pand-dih (Panj-dih?) and Marūchāq,
killing a mass of men.<a name="FNanchor_1178" id="FNanchor_1178"></a><a href="#Footnote_1178" class="fnanchor">1178</a></p>

<p>Badī‘u’z-zamān Mīrzā and Muz̤affar-i-ḥusain Mīrzā with
Muḥammad Barandūq <i>Barlās</i>, Ẕū’n-nūn <i>Arghūn</i> and his son
Shāh Beg resolved to move on Shaibāq Khān, then besieging
Sl. Qul-i-nachāq (?) in Balkh. Accordingly they summoned all
Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā’s sons, and got out of Herī to effect their
purpose. At Chihil-dukhtarān Abū’l-muḥsin M. joined them
from Marv; Ibn-i-ḥusain M. followed, coming up from Tūn and
Qāīn. Kūpuk (Kīpik) M. was in Mashhad; often though they
sent to him, he behaved unmanly, spoke senseless words, and did
not come. Between him and Muz̤affar Mīrzā, there was jealousy;
when Muz̤affar M. was made (joint-)ruler, he said, “How should
<i>I</i> go to <i>his</i> presence?” Through this disgusting jealousy he did
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>not come now, even at this crisis when all his brethren, older and
younger, were assembling in concord, resolute against such a foe<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;185b.</span>
as Shaibāq Khān. Kūpuk M. laid his own absence to rivalry,
but everybody else laid it to his cowardice. One word! In this
world acts such as his outlive the man; if a man have any share
of intelligence, why try to be ill-spoken of after death? if he
be ambitious, why not try so to act that, he gone, men will praise
him? In the honourable mention of their names, wise men find
a second life!</p>

<p>Envoys from the Mīrzās came to me also, Mūh. Barandūq
<i>Barlās</i> himself following them. As for me, what was to hinder
my going? It was for that very purpose I had travelled one or
two hundred <i>yīghāch</i> (500-600 miles)! I at once started with
Muḥ. Barandūq Beg for Murgh-āb<a name="FNanchor_1179" id="FNanchor_1179"></a><a href="#Footnote_1179" class="fnanchor">1179</a> where the Mīrzās were lying.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>e. Bābur meets the Mīrzās.</i>)</p>

<p>The meeting with the Mīrzās was on Monday the 8th of the
latter Jumāda (Oct. 26th 1506 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>). Abū’l-muḥsin Mīrzā came
out a mile to meet me; we approached one another; on my side,
I dismounted, on his side, he; we advanced, saw one another
and remounted. Near the camp Muz̤affar Mīrzā and Ibn-i-ḥusain
Mīrzā met us; they, being younger than Abū’l-muḥsin Mīrzā
ought to have come out further than he to meet me.<a name="FNanchor_1180" id="FNanchor_1180"></a><a href="#Footnote_1180" class="fnanchor">1180</a> Their
dilatoriness may not have been due to pride, but to heaviness<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;186.</span>
after wine; their negligence may have been no slight on me,
but due to their own social pleasures. On this Muz̤affar Mīrzā
laid stress;<a name="FNanchor_1181" id="FNanchor_1181"></a><a href="#Footnote_1181" class="fnanchor">1181</a> we two saw one another without dismounting, so
did Ibn-i-ḥusain Mīrzā and I. We rode on together and, in an
amazing crowd and press, dismounted at Badī‘u’z-zamān Mīrzā’s
Gate. Such was the throng that some were lifted off the ground
for three or four steps together, while others, wishing for some
reason to get out, were carried, willy-nilly, four or five steps the
other way.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span></p>
<p>We reached Badī‘u’z-zamān Mīrzā’s Audience-tent. It had
been agreed that I, on entering, should bend the knee (<i>yūkūnghāī</i>)
once, that the Mīrzā should rise and advance to the edge of the
estrade,<a name="FNanchor_1182" id="FNanchor_1182"></a><a href="#Footnote_1182" class="fnanchor">1182</a> and that we should see one another there. I went in,
bent the knee once, and was going right forward; the Mīrzā
rose rather languidly and advanced rather slowly; Qāsim Beg,
as he was my well-wisher and held my reputation as his own,
gave my girdle a tug; I understood, moved more slowly, and
so the meeting was on the appointed spot.</p>

<p>Four divans (<i>tūshuk</i>) had been placed in the tent. Always
in the Mīrzā’s tents one side was like a gate-way<a name="FNanchor_1183" id="FNanchor_1183"></a><a href="#Footnote_1183" class="fnanchor">1183</a> and at the
edge of this gate-way he always sat. A divan was set there now
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;186b.</span>on which he and Muz̤affar Mīrzā sat together. Abū’l-muḥsin,
Mīrzā and I sat on another, set in the right-hand place of
honour (<i>tūr</i>). On another, to Badī‘u’z-zamān Mīrzā’s left, sat
Ibn-i-ḥusain Mīrzā with Qāsim Sl. <i>Aūzbeg</i>, a son-in-law of the
late Mīrzā and father of Qāsim-i-ḥusain Sult̤ān. To my right
and below my divan was one on which sat Jahāngīr Mīrzā and
‘Abdu’r-razzāq Mīrzā. To the left of Qāsim Sl. and Ibn-i-ḥusain
Mīrzā, but a good deal lower, were Muḥ. Barandūq Beg, Ẕū’n-nūn
Beg and Qāsim Beg.</p>

<p>Although this was not a social gathering, cooked viands were
brought in, drinkables<a name="FNanchor_1184" id="FNanchor_1184"></a><a href="#Footnote_1184" class="fnanchor">1184</a> were set with the food, and near them
gold and silver cups. Our forefathers through a long space of
time, had respected the Chīngīz-tūrā (ordinance), doing nothing
opposed to it, whether in assembly or Court, in sittings-down
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>or risings-up. Though it has not Divine authority so that
a man obeys it of necessity, still good rules of conduct must be
obeyed by whom-soever they are left; just in the same way
that, if a forefather have done ill, his ill must be changed
for good.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>f. Bābur claims due respect.</i>)</p>

<p>At my second visit Badī‘u’z-zamān Mīrzā shewed me less
respect than at my first. I therefore had it said to Muḥ.
Barandūq Beg and to Ẕū’n-nūn Beg that, small though my age
was (<i>aet.</i> 24), my place of honour was large; that I had seated
myself twice on the throne of our forefathers in Samarkand by
blow straight-dealt; and that to be laggard in shewing me
respect was unreasonable, since it was for this (Tīmūrid) dynasty’s

said, and as it was reasonable, they admitted their mistake at

<p>There was a wine-party (<i>chāghīr-majlisī</i>) once when I went
after the Mid-day Prayer to Badī‘u’z-zamān Mīrzā’s presence.
At that time I drank no wine. The party was altogether
elegant; every sort of relish to wine (<i>gazak</i>) was set out on the
napery, with brochettes of fowl and goose, and all sorts of
viands. The Mīrzā’s entertainments were much renowned;
truly was this one free from the pang of thirst (<i>bī ghall</i>), reposeful
and tranquil. I was at two or three of his wine-parties while
we were on the bank of the Murgh-āb; once it was known I did
not drink, no pressure to do so was put on me.</p>

<p>I went to one wine-party of Muz̤affar Mīrzā’s. Ḥusain of
‘Alī <i>Jalāīr</i> and Mīr Badr were both there, they being in his

and danced well what seemed to be his own invention.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>h. Comments on the Mīrzās.</i>)</p>

<p>Three months it took the Mīrzās to get out of Herī,
agree amongst themselves, collect troops, and reach Murgh-āb.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
Meantime Sl. Qul-i-nachāq (?), reduced to extremity, had
surrendered Balkh to the Aūzbeg but that Aūzbeg, hearing of
our alliance against him, had hurried back to Samarkand. The
Mīrzās were good enough as company and in social matters,
in conversation and parties, but they were strangers to war,
strategy, equipment, bold fight and encounter.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>i. Winter plans.</i>)</p>

<p>While we were on the Murgh-āb, news came that Ḥaq-naz̤īr
<i>Chapā</i> (var. Ḥiān) was over-running the neighbourhood of
Chīchīk-tū with 4 or 500 men. All the Mīrzās there present,
do what they would, could not manage to send a light troop
against those raiders! It is 10 <i>yīghāch</i> (50-55 m.) from
Murgh-āb to Chīchīk-tū. I asked the work; they, with a thought
for their own reputation, would not give it to me.</p>

<p>The year being almost at an end when Shaibāq Khān retired,
the Mīrzās decided to winter where it was convenient and to
reassemble next summer in order to repel their foe.</p>

<p>They pressed me to winter in Khurāsān, but this not one of
my well-wishers saw it good for me to do because, while Kābul
and Ghaznī were full of a turbulent and ill-conducted medley of
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;188.</span>people and hordes, Turks, Mughūls, clans and nomads (<i>aīmāq u
aḥsham</i>), Afghāns and Hazāra, the roads between us and that
not yet desirably subjected country of Kābul were, one, the
mountain-road, a month’s journey even without delay through
snow or other cause,&mdash;the other, the low-country road, a journey
of 40 or 50 days.</p>

<p>Consequently we excused ourselves to the Mīrzās, but they
would accept no excuse and, for all our pleas, only urged
the more. In the end Badī‘u’z-zamān Mīrzā, Abū’l-muḥsin
Mīrzā and Muz̤affar Mīrzā themselves rode to my tent and
urged me to stay the winter. It was impossible to refuse men
of such ruling position, come in person to press us to stay on.
Besides this, the whole habitable world has not such a town as
Herī had become under Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā, whose orders and
efforts had increased its splendour and beauty as ten to one,
rather, as twenty to one. As I greatly wished to stay, I consented
to do so.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span></p>

<p>Abū’l-muḥsin M. went to Marv, his own district; Ibn-i-ḥusain
M. went to his, Tūn and Qāīn; Badī‘u’z-zamān M. and

bending the knee,<a name="FNanchor_1187" id="FNanchor_1187"></a><a href="#Footnote_1187" class="fnanchor">1187</a> I had an interview with Apāq Begīm; next,

After partaking of this, we went to Pāyanda-sult̤ān Begīm’s

<p>The New-year’s Garden was given us first for a camping-ground;
there our camp was arranged; and there I spent the

not find it a convenient place, ‘Alī-sher Beg’s residence was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>assigned to me, where I was as long as I stayed in Herī, every

<p class="indent">(<i>k. The Mīrzās entertain Bābur in Herī.</i>)</p>

<p>A few days after Muz̤affar Mīrzā had settled down in the
White-garden, he invited me to his quarters; Khadīja Begīm
was also there, and with me went Jahāngīr Mīrzā. When we
had eaten a meal in the Begīm’s presence,<a name="FNanchor_1189" id="FNanchor_1189"></a><a href="#Footnote_1189" class="fnanchor">1189</a> Muz̤affar Mīrzā took
me to where there was a wine-party, in the T̤arab-khāna (Joy-house)
built by Bābur Mīrzā, a sweet little abode, a smallish,
two-storeyed house in the middle of a smallish garden. Great
pains have been taken with its upper storey; this has a retreat
(<i>ḥujra</i>) in each of its four corners, the space between each two
retreats being like a <i>shāh-nīshīn</i><a name="FNanchor_1190" id="FNanchor_1190"></a><a href="#Footnote_1190" class="fnanchor">1190</a>; in between these retreats and
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;189.</span><i>shāh-nīshīns</i> is one large room on all sides of which are pictures
which, although Bābur Mīrzā built the house, were commanded
by Abū-sa‘īd Mīrzā and depict his own wars and encounters.</p>

<p>Two divans had been set in the north <i>shāh-nīshīn</i>, facing each
other, and with their sides turned to the north. On one Muz̤affar
Mīrzā and I sat, on the other Sl. Mas‘ūd Mīrzā<a name="FNanchor_1191" id="FNanchor_1191"></a><a href="#Footnote_1191" class="fnanchor">1191</a> and Jahāngīr
Mīrzā. We being guests, Muz̤affar Mīrzā gave me place above
himself. The social cups were filled, the cup-bearers ordered to
carry them to the guests; the guests drank down the mere wine
as if it were water-of-life; when it mounted to their heads, the
party waxed warm.</p>

<p>They thought to make me also drink and to draw me into
their own circle. Though up till then I had not committed the
sin of wine-drinking<a name="FNanchor_1192" id="FNanchor_1192"></a><a href="#Footnote_1192" class="fnanchor">1192</a> and known the cheering sensation of
comfortable drunkenness, I was inclined to drink wine and my
heart was drawn to cross that stream (<i>wāda</i>). I had had no
inclination for wine in my childhood; I knew nothing of its
cheer and pleasure. If, as sometimes, my father pressed wine
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>on me, I excused myself; I did not commit the sin. After he<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;189b.</span>
died, Khwāja Qāẓī’s right guidance kept me guiltless; as at that
time I abstained from forbidden viands, what room was there
for the sin of wine? Later on when, with the young man’s
lusts and at the prompting of sensual passion, desire for wine
arose, there was no-one to press it on me, no-one indeed aware
of my leaning towards it; so that, inclined for it though my
heart was, it was difficult of myself to do such a thing, one
thitherto undone. It crossed my mind now, when the Mīrzās
were so pressing and when too we were in a town so refined as
Herī, “Where should I drink if not here? here where all the
chattels and utensils of luxury and comfort are gathered
and in use.” So saying to myself, I resolved to drink wine;
I determined to cross that stream; but it occurred to me that as
I had not taken wine in Badī‘u’z-zamān Mīrzā’s house or from
his hand, who was to me as an elder brother, things might find
way into his mind if I took wine in his younger brother’s house
and from his hand. Having so said to myself, I mentioned my
doubt and difficulty. Said they, “Both the excuse and the
obstacle are reasonable,” pressed me no more to drink then but
settled that when I was in company with both Mīrzās, I should
drink under the insistance of both.</p>

<p>Amongst the musicians present at this party were Ḥāfiẓ Ḥājī,<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;190.</span>
Jalālu’d-dīn Maḥmūd the flautist, and Ghulām <i>shādī</i>’s younger
brother, Ghulām <i>bacha</i> the Jews'-harpist. Ḥāfiẓ Ḥājī sang well,
as Herī people sing, quietly, delicately, and in tune. With
Jahāngīr Mīrzā was a Samarkandī singer Mīr Jān whose
singing was always loud, harsh and out-of-tune. The Mīrzā,
having had enough, ordered him to sing; he did so, loudly,
harshly and without taste. Khurāsānīs have quite refined
manners; if, under this singing, one did stop his ears, the face
of another put question, not one could stop the singer, out of
consideration for the Mīrzā.</p>

<p>After the Evening Prayer we left the T̤arab-khāna for a new
house in Muz̤affar Mīrzā’s winter-quarters. There Yūsuf-i-‘alī
danced in the drunken time, and being, as he was, a master in music,
danced well. The party waxed very warm there. Muz̤affar Mīrzā
gave me a sword-belt, a lambskin surtout, and a grey <i>tīpūchāq</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
(horse). Jānak recited in Turkī. Two slaves of the Mīrzā’s,
known as Big-moon and Little-moon, did offensive, drunken
tricks in the drunken time. The party was warm till night when
those assembled scattered, I, however, staying the night in that
house.</p>

<p>Qāsim Beg getting to hear that I had been pressed to drink
wine, sent some-one to Ẕū’n-nūn Beg with advice for him and
for Muz̤affar Mīrzā, given in very plain words; the result was
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;190b.</span>that the Mīrzās entirely ceased to press wine upon me.</p>

<p>Badī‘u’z-zamān Mīrzā, hearing that Muz̤affar M. had entertained
me, asked me to a party arranged in the Maqauwī-khāna of the
World-adorning Garden. He asked also some of my close
circle<a name="FNanchor_1193" id="FNanchor_1193"></a><a href="#Footnote_1193" class="fnanchor">1193</a> and some of our braves. Those about me could never
drink (openly) on my own account; if they ever did drink,
they did it perhaps once in 40 days, with doorstrap fast and
under a hundred fears. Such as these were now invited; here
too they drank with a hundred precautions, sometimes calling
off my attention, sometimes making a screen of their hands,
notwithstanding that I had given them permission to follow
common custom, because this party was given by one standing
to me as a father or elder brother. People brought in weeping-willows....<a name="FNanchor_1194" id="FNanchor_1194"></a><a href="#Footnote_1194" class="fnanchor">1194</a></p>

<p>At this party they set a roast goose before me but as I was
no carver or disjointer of birds, I left it alone. “Do you not
like it?” inquired the Mīrzā. Said I, “I am a poor carver.”
On this he at once disjointed the bird and set it again before
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;191.</span>me. In such matters he had no match. At the end of the
party he gave me an enamelled waist-dagger, a <i>chār-qāb</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1195" id="FNanchor_1195"></a><a href="#Footnote_1195" class="fnanchor">1195</a> and

said, “Winter here!” but they had given me no winter-quarters
nor had they made any winter-arrangements for me. Winter
came on; snow fell on the mountains between us and Kābul;
anxiety grew about Kābul; no winter-quarters were offered, no
arrangements made! As we could not speak out, of necessity
we left Herī!</p>

<p>On the pretext of finding winter-quarters, we got out of the
town on the 7th day of the month of Sha‘bān (Dec. 24th 1506 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>),
and went to near Bādghīs. Such were our slowness and our

the gate-ward, who became Badī‘u’z-zamān Mīrzā’s retainer. To
no servant of Khusrau Shāh had I shewn so much favour as to
him; he had been given Ghaznī when Jahāngīr Mīrzā abandoned
it, and in it when he came away with the army, had left his

no better men amongst Khusrau Shāh’s retainers than this man
Sayyidīm ‘Alī the gate-ward and Muḥibb-i-‘alī the armourer.
Sayyidīm was of excellent nature and manners, a bold swordsman,
a singularly competent and methodical man. His house was
never without company and assembly; he was greatly generous,
had wit and charm, a variety of talk and story, and was a sweet-natured,
good-humoured, ingenious, fun-loving person. His
fault was that he practised vice and pederasty. He may have
swerved from the Faith; may also have been a hypocrite in his
dealings; some of what seemed double-dealing people attributed
to his jokes, but, still, there must have been a something!<a name="FNanchor_1218" id="FNanchor_1218"></a><a href="#Footnote_1218" class="fnanchor">1218</a>

thrown into the Harmand because of his double-dealing words
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>spoken between the Mīrzā and Shāh Beg. Muḥibb-i-‘alī’s story

<p class="indent">(<i>o. A perilous mountain-journey.</i>)</p>

<p>From the Langar of Mīr Ghiyās̤ we had ourselves guided past
the border-villages of Gharjistān to Chach-charān.<a name="FNanchor_1219" id="FNanchor_1219"></a><a href="#Footnote_1219" class="fnanchor">1219</a> From the
almshouse to Gharjistān was an unbroken sheet of snow; it was
deeper further on; near Chach-charān itself it was above the
horses’ knees. Chach-charān depended on Ẕū’n-nūn <i>Arghūn</i>;
his retainer Mīr Jān-aīrdī was in it now; from him we took, on
payment, the whole of Ẕū’n-nūn Beg’s store of provisions.
A march or two further on, the snow was very deep, being above
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;193.</span>the stirrup, indeed in many places the horses’ feet did not touch
the ground.</p>

<p>We had consulted at the Langar of Mīr Ghiyās̤ which road to
take for return to Kābul; most of us agreed in saying, “It is
winter, the mountain-road is difficult and dangerous; the
Qandahār road, though a little longer, is safe and easy.” Qāsim
Beg said, “That road is long; you will go by this one.” As he
made much dispute, we took the mountain-road.</p>

<p>Our guide was a Pashāī named Pīr Sult̤ān (Old sultan?).
Whether it was through old age, whether from want of heart,
whether because of the deep snow, he lost the road and could
not guide us. As we were on this route under the insistance of
Qāsim Beg, he and his sons, for his name’s sake, dismounted,
trampled the snow down, found the road again and took the
lead. One day the snow was so deep and the way so uncertain
that we could not go on; there being no help for it, back we
turned, dismounted where there was fuel, picked out 60 or 70
good men and sent them down the valley in our tracks to fetch
any one soever of the Hazāra, wintering in the valley-bottom,
who might shew us the road. That place could not be left till
our men returned three or four days later. They brought no
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;193b.</span>guide; once more we sent Sult̤ān <i>Pashāī</i> ahead and, putting our
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>trust in God, again took the road by which we had come back
from where it was lost. Much misery and hardship were
endured in those few days, more than at any time of my life.
In that stress I composed the following opening couplet:&mdash;</p>

<p>We went on for nearly a week, trampling down the snow and
not getting forward more than two or three miles a day. I was
one of the snow-stampers, with 10 or 15 of my household, Qāsim
Beg, his sons Tīngrī-bīrdī and Qaṃbar-i-‘alī and two or three of
their retainers. These mentioned used to go forward for 7 or 8
yards, stamping the snow down and at each step sinking to the
waist or the breast. After a few steps the leading man would
stand still, exhausted by the labour, and another would go
forward. By the time 10, 15, 20, men on foot had stamped the
snow down, it became so that a horse might be led over it.
A horse would be led, would sink to the stirrups, could do no
more than 10 or 12 steps, and would be drawn aside to let another
go on. After we, 10, 15, 20, men had stamped down the snow
and had led horses forward in this fashion, very serviceable<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;194.</span>
braves and men of renowned name would enter the beaten track,
hanging their heads. It was not a time to urge or compel! the
man with will and hardihood for such tasks does them by his
own request! Stamping the snow down in this way, we got
out of that afflicting place (<i>ānjūkān yīr</i>) in three or four days to
a cave known as the Khawāl-i-qūtī (Blessed-cave), below the
Zirrīn-pass.</p>

<p>That night the snow fell in such an amazing blizzard of cutting
wind that every man feared for his life. The storm had become
extremely violent by the time we reached the <i>khawāl</i>, as people
in those parts call a mountain-cave (<i>ghar</i>) or hollow (<i>khāwāk</i>).
We dismounted at its mouth. Deep snow! a one-man road!
and even on that stamped-down and trampled road, pitfalls for
horses! the days at their shortest! The first arrivals reached
the cave by daylight; others kept coming in from the Evening
Prayer till the Bed-time one; later than that people dismounted
wherever they happened to be; dawn shot with many still in
the saddle.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span></p>

<p>The cave seeming to be rather small, I took a shovel and
shovelled out a place near its mouth, the size of a sitting-mat
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;194b.</span>(<i>takiya-namad</i>), digging it out breast-high but even then not
reaching the ground. This made me a little shelter from the
wind when I sat right down in it. I did not go into the cave
though people kept saying, “Come inside,” because this was in
my mind, “Some of my men in snow and storm, I in the
comfort of a warm house! the whole horde (<i>aūlūs</i>) outside in
misery and pain, I inside sleeping at ease! That would be far
from a man’s act, quite another matter than comradeship!
Whatever hardship and wretchedness there is, I will face; what
strong men stand, I will stand; for, as the Persian proverb says,
to die with friends is a nuptial.” Till the Bed-time Prayer
I sat through that blizzard of snow and wind in the dug-out,
the snow-fall being such that my head, back, and ears were
overlaid four hands thick. The cold of that night affected my
ears. At the Bed-time Prayer some-one, looking more carefully
at the cave, shouted out, “It is a very roomy cave with place for
every-body.” On hearing this I shook off my roofing of snow
and, asking the braves near to come also, went inside. There
was room for 50 or 60! People brought out their rations, cold
meat, parched grain, whatever they had. From such cold and
tumult to a place so warm, cosy and quiet!<a name="FNanchor_1220" id="FNanchor_1220"></a><a href="#Footnote_1220" class="fnanchor">1220</a></p>

<p>Next day the snow and wind having ceased, we made an
early start and we got to the pass by again stamping down
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;195.</span>a road in the snow. The proper road seems to make a détour
up the flank of the mountain and to go over higher up, by what
is understood to be called the Zirrīn-pass. Instead of taking
that road, we went straight up the valley-bottom (<i>qūl</i>).<a name="FNanchor_1221" id="FNanchor_1221"></a><a href="#Footnote_1221" class="fnanchor">1221</a> It was
night before we reached the further side of the (Bakkak-)pass;
we spent the night there in the mouth of the valley, a night of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>mighty cold, got through with great distress and suffering.
Many a man had his hands and feet frost-bitten; that night’s
cold took both Kīpa’s feet, both Sīūndūk <i>Turkmān</i>’s hands,
both Āhī’s feet. Early next morning we moved down the
valley; putting our trust in God, we went straight down, by bad
slopes and sudden falls, knowing and seeing it could not be the
right way. It was the Evening Prayer when we got out of
that valley. No long-memoried old man knew that any-one
had been heard of as crossing that pass with the snow so deep,
or indeed that it had ever entered the heart of man to cross it
at that time of year. Though for a few days we had suffered
greatly through the depth of the snow, yet its depth, in the end,
enabled us to reach our destination. For why? How otherwise
should we have traversed those pathless slopes and sudden falls?<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;195b.</span></p>

water without stint, ample wood and dried dung for fires!
To escape from such snow and cold to such a village, to such
warm dwellings, was comfort those will understand who have
had our trials, relief known to those who have felt our hardships.

<p>News came while we were raiding the Turkmān Hazāras,
that Muḥammad Ḥusain Mīrzā <i>Dūghlāt</i> and Sl. Sanjar <i>Barlās</i>
had drawn over to themselves the Mughūls left in Kābul,
declared Mīrzā Khān (Wais) supreme (<i>pādshāh</i>), laid siege to
the fort and spread a <i>report</i> that Badī‘u’z-zamān Mīrzā and
Muz̤affar Mīrzā had sent me, a prisoner, to Fort Ikhtiyāru’d-dīn,
now known as Ālā-qūrghān.</p>

<p>In command of the Kābul-fort there had been left Mullā
Bābā of Pashāghar, Khalīfa, Muḥibb-i-‘alī the armourer, Aḥmad-i-yūsuf
and Aḥmad-i-qāsim. They did well, made the fort fast,
strengthened it, and kept watch.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>k. Bābur’s advance to Kābul.</i>)</p>

<p>From Tīmūr Beg’s Langar we sent Qāsim Beg’s servant, Muḥ.
of Andijān, a <i>Tūqbāī</i>, to the Kābul begs, with written details
of our arrival and of the following arrangements:&mdash;“When we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
are out of the Ghūr-bund narrows,<a name="FNanchor_1227" id="FNanchor_1227"></a><a href="#Footnote_1227" class="fnanchor">1227</a> we will fall on them suddenly;
let our signal to you be the fire we will light directly we have

sure you know of our coming. We will come up from our side;
you come out from yours; neglect nothing your hands can find
to do!” This having been put into writing, Muḥammad
<i>Andijānī</i> was sent off.</p>

<p>Riding next dawn from the Langar, we dismounted over against
Ushtur-shahr. Early next morning we passed the Ghūr-bund
narrows, dismounted at Bridge-head, there watered and rested our
horses, and at the Mid-day Prayer set forward again. Till we
reached the <i>tūtqāwal</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1228" id="FNanchor_1228"></a><a href="#Footnote_1228" class="fnanchor">1228</a> there was no snow, beyond that, the
further we went the deeper the snow. The cold between Ẕamma-yakhshī
and Minār was such as we had rarely felt in our lives.</p>

<p>We sent on Aḥmad the messenger (<i>yāsāwal</i>) and Qarā Aḥmad
<i>yūrūnchī</i><a name="FNanchor_1229" id="FNanchor_1229"></a><a href="#Footnote_1229" class="fnanchor">1229</a> to say to the begs, “Here we are at the time promised;

on its skirt, helpless with cold, we lit fires to warm ourselves.
It was not time to light the signal-fire; we just lit these because
we were helpless in that mighty cold. Near shoot of dawn we
rode on from Minār-hill; between it and Kābul the snow was up
to the horses’ knees and had hardened, so off the road to move
was difficult. Riding single-file the whole way, we got to Kābul

<p>On reaching Sayyid Qāsim’s bridge, Sherīm T̤aghāī and the
men of the right were sent towards Mullā Bābā’s bridge, while
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
we of the left and centre took the Bābā Lūlī road. Where Khalīfa’s
garden now is, there was then a smallish garden made by Aūlūgh
Beg Mīrzā for a Langar (almshouse); none of its trees or shrubs
were left but its enclosing wall was there. In this garden Mīrzā
Khān was seated, Muḥ. Ḥusain Mīrzā being in Aūlūgh Beg Mīrzā’s
great Bāgh-i-bihisht. I had gone as far along the lane of Mullā
Bābā’s garden as the burial-ground when four men met us who
had hurried forward into Mīrzā Khān’s quarters, been beaten,
and forced to turn back. One of the four was Sayyid Qāsim
Lord of the Gate, another was Qāsim Beg’s son Qaṃbar-i-‘alī,
another was Sher-qulī the scout, another was Sl. Aḥmad <i>Mughūl</i>
one of Sher-qulī’s band. These four, without a “God forbid!”
(<i>taḥāshī</i>) had gone right into Mīrzā Khān’s quarters; thereupon
he, hearing an uproar, had mounted and got away. Abū’l-ḥasan
the armourer’s younger brother even, Muḥ. Ḥusain by name,
had taken service with Mīrzā Khān; he had slashed at Sher-qulī,<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;198b.</span>
one of those four, thrown him down, and was just striking his
head off, when Sher-qulī freed himself. Those four, tasters of
the sword, tasters of the arrow, wounded one and all, came
pelting back on us to the place mentioned.</p>

<p>Our horsemen, jammed in the narrow lane, were standing
still, unable to move forward or back. Said I to the braves
near, “Get off and force a road”. Off got Nāṣir’s Dost, Khwāja
Muḥammad ‘Alī the librarian, Bābā Sher-zād (Tiger-whelp),
Shāh Maḥmūd and others, pushed forward and at once cleared
the way. The enemy took to flight.</p>

<p>We had looked for the begs to come out from the Fort but
they could not come in time for the work; they only dropped
in, by ones and twos, after we had made the enemy scurry off.
Aḥmad-i-yūsuf had come from them before I went into the
Chār-bāgh where Mīrzā Khān had been; he went in with me,
but we both turned back when we saw the Mīrzā had gone off.
Coming in at the garden-gate was Dost of Sar-i-pul, a foot-soldier
I had promoted for his boldness to be Kotwāl and had left in
Kābul; he made straight for me, sword in hand. I had my
cuirass on but had not fastened the <i>gharīcha</i><a name="FNanchor_1232" id="FNanchor_1232"></a><a href="#Footnote_1232" class="fnanchor">1232</a> nor had I put on<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;199.</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>my helm. Whether he did not recognize me because of change
wrought by cold and snow, or whether because of the flurry of
the fight, though I shouted “Hāī Dost! hāī Dost!” and though
Aḥmad-i-yūsuf also shouted, he, without a “God forbid!”
brought down his sword on my unprotected arm. Only by
God’s grace can it have been that not a hairbreadth of harm
was done to me.</p>

<div class="line">If a sword shook the Earth from her place,</div>

<p>It was through the virtue of a prayer I had repeated that the
Great God averted this danger and turned this evil aside. That
prayer was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“O my God! Thou art my Creator; except Thee there is no God. On
Thee do I repose my trust; Thou art the Lord of the mighty throne. What
God wills comes to pass; and what he does not will comes not to pass; and
there is no power or strength but through the high and exalted God; and, of
a truth, in all things God is almighty; and verily He comprehends all things
by his knowledge, and has taken account of everything. O my Creator! as
I sincerely trust in Thee, do Thou seize by the forelock all evil proceeding
from within myself, and all evil coming from without, and all evil proceeding
from every man who can be the occasion of evil, and all such evil as can proceed
from any living thing, and remove them far from me; since, of a truth, Thou
art the Lord of the exalted throne!”<a name="FNanchor_1233" id="FNanchor_1233"></a><a href="#Footnote_1233" class="fnanchor">1233</a></p></div>

<p>On leaving that garden we went to Muḥ. Ḥusain Mīrzā’s
quarters in the Bāgh-i-bihisht, but he had fled and gone off to
hide himself. Seven or eight men stood in a breach of the
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;199b.</span>garden-wall; I spurred at them; they could not stand; they
fled; I got up with them and cut at one with my sword; he
rolled over in such a way that I fancied his head was off, passed
on and went away; it seems he was Mīrzā Khān’s foster-brother,
Tūlik Kūkūldāsh and that my sword fell on his shoulder.</p>

<p>At the gate of Muḥ. Ḥusain Mīrzā’s quarters, a Mughūl
I recognized for one of my own servants, drew his bow and aimed
at my face from a place on the roof as near me as a gate-ward
stands to a Gate. People on all sides shouted, “Hāi! hāi! it is
the Pādshāh.” He changed his aim, shot off his arrow and ran
away. The affair was beyond the shooting of arrows! His
Mīrzā, his leaders, had run away or been taken; why was he
shooting?</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span></p>
<p>There they brought Sl. Sanjar <i>Barlās</i>, led in by a rope round
his neck; he even, to whom I had given the Nīngnahār <i>tūmān</i>,
had had his part in the mutiny! Greatly agitated, he kept
crying out, “Hāi! what fault is in me?” Said I, “Can there
be one clearer than that you are higher than the purpose and
counsels of this crew?”<a name="FNanchor_1234" id="FNanchor_1234"></a><a href="#Footnote_1234" class="fnanchor">1234</a> But as he was the sister’s son of my
Khān <i>dādā’s</i> mother, Shāh Begīm, I gave the order, “Do not
lead him with such dishonour; it is not death.”</p>

<p>On leaving that place, I sent Aḥmad-i-qasim <i>Kohbur</i>, one
of the begs of the Fort, with a few braves, in pursuit of<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;200.</span>
Mīrzā Khān.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>m. Bābur’s dealings with disloyal women.</i>)</p>

<p>When I left the Bāgh-i-bihisht, I went to visit Shāh Begīm
and (Mihr-nigār) Khānīm who had settled themselves in tents
by the side of the garden.</p>

<p>As townspeople and black-bludgeoners had raised a riot, and
were putting hands out to pillage property and to catch persons
in corners and outside places, I sent men, to beat the rabble off,
and had it herded right away.<a name="FNanchor_1235" id="FNanchor_1235"></a><a href="#Footnote_1235" class="fnanchor">1235</a></p>

<p>Shāh Begīm and Khānīm were seated in one tent. I dismounted
at the usual distance, approached with my former
deference and courtesy, and had an interview with them. They
were extremely agitated, upset, and ashamed; could neither
excuse themselves reasonably<a name="FNanchor_1236" id="FNanchor_1236"></a><a href="#Footnote_1236" class="fnanchor">1236</a> nor make the enquiries of affection.
I had not expected this (disloyalty) of them; it was not as
though that party, evil as was the position it had taken up,
consisted of persons who would not give ear to the words of
Shāh Begīm and Khānīm; Mīrzā Khān was the begīm’s grandson,
in her presence night and day; if she had not fallen in with
the affair, she could have kept him with her.</p>

<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;200b.</span>me from throne and country, retainer and following, I, and my
mother with me, had taken refuge with them and had had no
kindness soever from them. At that time my younger brother
(<i>i.e.</i> cousin) Mīrzā Khān and his mother Sult̤ān-nigār Khānīm
held valuable cultivated districts; yet my mother and I,&mdash;to
leave all question of a district aside,&mdash;were not made possessors
of a single village or a few yoke of plough-oxen.<a name="FNanchor_1237" id="FNanchor_1237"></a><a href="#Footnote_1237" class="fnanchor">1237</a> Was my
mother not Yūnas Khān’s daughter? was I not his grandson?</p>

<p>In my days of plenty I have given from my hand what matched
the blood-relationship and the position of whatsoever member
of that (Chaghatāī) dynasty chanced down upon me. For
example, when the honoured Shāh Begīm came to me, I gave
her Pamghān, one of the best places in Kābul, and failed in no
sort of filial duty and service towards her. Again, when Sl. Sa‘īd
Khān, Khān in Kāshghar, came [914 <i>AH.</i>] with five or six naked
followers on foot, I looked upon him as an honoured guest and
gave him Mandrāwar of the Lamghān <i>tūmāns</i>. Beyond this
also, when Shāh Ismā‘īl had killed Shaibāq Khān in Marv and
I crossed over to Qūndūz (916 <i>AH.</i>-1511 <i>AD.</i>), the Andijānīs,
some driving their (Aūzbeg) <i>dāroghas</i> out, some making their
places fast, turned their eyes to me and sent me a man; at that
time I trusted those old family servants to that same Sl. Sa‘īd
Khān, gave him a force, made him Khān and sped him forth.
Again, down to the present time (<i>circa</i> 934 <i>AH.</i>) I have not
looked upon any member of that family who has come to me,
in any other light than as a blood-relation. For example, there
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;201.</span>are now in my service Chīn-tīmūr Sult̤ān; Aīsān-tīmūr Sult̤ān,
Tūkhtā-būghā Sult̤ān, and Bābā Sult̤ān;<a name="FNanchor_1238" id="FNanchor_1238"></a><a href="#Footnote_1238" class="fnanchor">1238</a> on one and all of
these I have looked with more favour than on blood-relations
of my own.</p>

<p>I do not write this in order to make complaint; I have
written the plain truth. I do not set these matters down in
order to make known my own deserts; I have set down exactly

<p>Muḥammad Ḥusain Mīrzā in his terror having run away into

him before me in the citadel. I rose at once to receive the
Mīrzā with my usual deference, not even shewing too harsh
a face. If I had had that Muḥ. Ḥusain M. cut in pieces, there
was the ground for it that he had had part in base and shameful
action, started and spurred on mutiny and treason. Death he
deserved with one after another of varied pain and torture, but
because there had come to be various connexion between us, his
very sons and daughters being by my own mother’s sister Khūb-nigār
Khānīm, I kept this just claim in mind, let him go free,
and permitted him to set out towards Khurāsān. The cowardly
ingrate then forgot altogether the good I did him by the gift of
his life; he blamed and slandered me to Shaibāq Khān. Little
time passed, however, before the Khān gave him his deserts by
death.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>q. Nāṣir Mīrzā expelled from Badakhshān.</i>)</p>

<p>This year the begs of Badakhshān <i>i.e.</i> Muḥammad the
armourer, Mubārak Shāh, Zubair and Jahāngīr, grew angry and
mutinous because of the misconduct of Nāṣir Mīrzā and some
of those he cherished. Coming to an agreement together, they
drew out an army of horse and foot, arrayed it on the level lands
by the Kūkcha-water, and moved towards Yaftal and Rāgh, to
near Khamchān, by way of the lower hills. The Mīrzā and his
inexperienced begs, in their thoughtless and unobservant fashion,
came out to fight them just in those lower hills. The battle-field
was uneven ground; the Badakhshīs had a dense mass of men
on foot who stood firm under repeated charges by the Mīrzā’s
horse, and returned such attack that the horsemen fled, unable
to keep their ground. Having beaten the Mīrzā, the Badakhshīs
plundered his dependants and connexions.</p>

<p>Beaten and stripped bare, he and his close circle took the road
through Ishkīmīsh and Nārīn to Kīlā-gāhī, from there followed
the Qīzīl-sū up, got out on the Āb-dara road, crossed at Shibr-tū,
and so came to Kābul, he with 70 or 80 followers, worn-out,
naked and famished.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span></p>

<p>That was a marvellous sign of the Divine might! Two or
three years earlier the Mīrzā had left the Kābul country like a
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;203.</span>foe, driving tribes and hordes like sheep before him, reached
Badakhshān and made fast its forts and valley-strongholds.
With what fancy in his mind had he marched out?<a name="FNanchor_1245" id="FNanchor_1245"></a><a href="#Footnote_1245" class="fnanchor">1245</a> Now he
was back, hanging the head of shame for those earlier misdeeds,
humbled and distraught about that breach with me!</p>

<p>My face shewed him no sort of displeasure; I made kind
enquiry about himself, and brought him out of his confusion.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>a. Raid on the Ghiljī Afghāns.</i>)</p>

<p>We had ridden out of Kābul with the intention of over-running
the Ghiljī;<a name="FNanchor_1247" id="FNanchor_1247"></a><a href="#Footnote_1247" class="fnanchor">1247</a> when we dismounted at Sar-i-dih news was brought
that a mass of Mahmands (Afghāns) was lying in Masht and
Sih-kāna one <i>yīghāch</i> (<i>circa</i> 5 m.) away from us.<a name="FNanchor_1248" id="FNanchor_1248"></a><a href="#Footnote_1248" class="fnanchor">1248</a> Our begs and
braves agreed in saying, “The Mahmands must be over-run”,
but I said, “Would it be right to turn aside and raid our own
peasants instead of doing what we set out to do? It cannot be.”</p>

<p>Riding at night from Sar-i-dih, we crossed the plain of Kattawāz
in the dark, a quite black night, one level stretch of land, no
mountain or rising-ground in sight, no known road or track, not
a man able to lead us! In the end I took the lead. I had been
in those parts several times before; drawing inferences from
those times, I took the Pole-star on my right shoulder-blade<a name="FNanchor_1249" id="FNanchor_1249"></a><a href="#Footnote_1249" class="fnanchor">1249</a>
and, with some anxiety, moved on. God brought it right! We
went straight to the Qīāq-tū and the Aūlābā-tū torrent, that is
to say, straight for Khwāja Ismā‘īl <i>Sirītī</i> where the Ghiljīs were
lying, the road to which crosses the torrent named. Dismounting
near the torrent, we let ourselves and our horses sleep a little,<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;203b.</span>
took breath, and bestirred ourselves at shoot of dawn. The Sun
was up before we got out of those low hills and valley-bottoms
to the plain on which the Ghiljī lay with a good <i>yīghāch</i><a name="FNanchor_1250" id="FNanchor_1250"></a><a href="#Footnote_1250" class="fnanchor">1250</a> of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>road between them and us; once out on the plain we could
see their blackness, either their own or from the smoke of
their fires.</p>

<p>Whether bitten by their own whim,<a name="FNanchor_1251" id="FNanchor_1251"></a><a href="#Footnote_1251" class="fnanchor">1251</a> or whether wanting to
hurry, the whole army streamed off at the gallop (<i>chāpqūn
qūīdīlār</i>); off galloped I after them and, by shooting an arrow
now at a man, now at a horse, checked them after a <i>kuroh</i> or
two (3 m.?). It is very difficult indeed to check 5 or 6000 braves
galloping loose-rein! God brought it right! They were checked!
When we had gone about one <i>shar‘ī</i> (2 m.) further, always with
the Afghān blackness in sight, the raid<a name="FNanchor_1252" id="FNanchor_1252"></a><a href="#Footnote_1252" class="fnanchor">1252</a> was allowed. Masses
of sheep fell to us, more than in any other raid.</p>

<p>After we had dismounted and made the spoils turn back,<a name="FNanchor_1253" id="FNanchor_1253"></a><a href="#Footnote_1253" class="fnanchor">1253</a> one
body of Afghāns after another came down into the plain, provoking
a fight. Some of the begs and of the household went against
one body and killed every man; Nāṣir Mīrzā did the same with
another, and a pillar of Afghān heads was set up. An arrow
pierced the foot of that foot-soldier Dost the Kotwāl who has
been mentioned already;<a name="FNanchor_1254" id="FNanchor_1254"></a><a href="#Footnote_1254" class="fnanchor">1254</a> when we reached Kābul, he died.</p>

<p>Marching from Khwāja Ismā‘īl, we dismounted once more at
Aūlābā-tū. Some of the begs and of my own household were
ordered to go forward and carefully separate off the Fifth
(<i>Khums</i>) of the enemy’s spoils. By way of favour, we did not
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;204.</span>take the Fifth from Qāsim Beg and some others.<a name="FNanchor_1255" id="FNanchor_1255"></a><a href="#Footnote_1255" class="fnanchor">1255</a> From what

this 16,000 was the fifth of 80,000 sheep; no question however
but that with those lost and those not asked for, a <i>lak</i> (100,000)
of sheep had been taken.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>b. A hunting-circle.</i>)</p>

<p>Next day when we had ridden from that camp, a hunting-circle
was formed on the plain of Kattawāz where deer (<i>kiyīk</i>)<a name="FNanchor_1257" id="FNanchor_1257"></a><a href="#Footnote_1257" class="fnanchor">1257</a> and
wild-ass are always plentiful and always fat. Masses went into
the ring; masses were killed. During the hunt I galloped after
a wild-ass, on getting near shot one arrow, shot another, but did
not bring it down, it only running more slowly for the two
wounds. Spurring forwards and getting into position<a name="FNanchor_1258" id="FNanchor_1258"></a><a href="#Footnote_1258" class="fnanchor">1258</a> quite
close to it, I chopped at the nape of its neck behind the ears, and
cut through the wind-pipe; it stopped, turned over and died.
My sword cut well! The wild-ass was surprisingly fat. Its
rib may have been a little under one yard in length. Sherīm
T̤aghāī and other observers of <i>kiyīk</i> in Mughūlistān said with
surprise, “Even in Mughūlistān we have seen few <i>kiyīk</i> so fat!”
I shot another wild-ass; most of the wild-asses and deer brought
down in that hunt were fat, but not one of them was so fat as
the one I first killed.</p>

<p>Turning back from that raid, we went to Kābul and there
dismounted.</p>

Khākī,<a name="FNanchor_1260" id="FNanchor_1260"></a><a href="#Footnote_1260" class="fnanchor">1260</a> not decided to fight, not settled to make (Herī) fort
fast, there they sat, confounded, vague, uncertain what to do.
Muḥammad Barandūq <i>Barlās</i> was a knowledgeable man; he
kept saying, “You let Muz̤affar Mīrzā and me make the fort
fast; let Badī‘u&acute;z-zamān Mīrzā and Ẕū&acute;n-nūn Beg go into the
mountains near Herī and gather in Sl. ‘Alī <i>Arghūn</i> from Sīstān
and Zamīn-dāwar, Shāh Beg and Muqīm from Qandahār with
all their armies, and let them collect also what there is of Nikdīrī
and Hazāra force; this done, let them make a swift and telling
move. The enemy would find it difficult to go into the
mountains, and could not come against the (Herī) fort because
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;205.</span>he would be afraid of the army outside.” He said well, his
plan was practical.</p>

<p>Brave though Ẕū&acute;n-nūn <i>Arghūn</i> was, he was mean, a lover-of-goods,
far from businesslike or judicious, rather shallow-pated,

and that younger brother became joint-rulers in Herī, he had
chief authority in Badī‘u&acute;z-zamān Mīrzā’s presence. He was not
willing now for Muḥ. Barandūq Beg to remain inside Herī town;
being the lover-of-goods he was, he wanted to be there himself.
But he could not make this seem one and the same thing!<a name="FNanchor_1262" id="FNanchor_1262"></a><a href="#Footnote_1262" class="fnanchor">1262</a> Is

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>these words, he put his bathing-cloth round his neck and gave
thanks. It was through this he did not accept Muḥammad
Barandūq Beg’s sensible counsel, did not strengthen the works
(<i>aīsh</i>) of the fort, get ready fighting equipment, set scout or
rearward to warn of the foe’s approach, or plan out such method

households (<i>biyutāt</i>). What was desirable for making the fort
fast had not been done; even braves to reinforce it had not
arrived. ‘Āshiq-i-muḥammad <i>Arghūn</i>, the younger brother of
Mazīd Beg, had fled from the army on foot and gone into it;

<p>When Shaibāq Khān arrived two or three days later; the

<p>Ten or fifteen days after he had possession of Herī, Shaibāq
Khān came from Kahd-stān<a name="FNanchor_1274" id="FNanchor_1274"></a><a href="#Footnote_1274" class="fnanchor">1274</a> to Pul-i-sālār. From that place
he sent Tīmūr Sl. and ‘Ubaid Sl. with the army there present,
against Abū’l-muḥsin Mīrzā and Kūpuk (Kīpik) Mīrzā then
seated carelessly in Mashhad. The two Mīrzās had thought at
one time of making Qalāt<a name="FNanchor_1275" id="FNanchor_1275"></a><a href="#Footnote_1275" class="fnanchor">1275</a> fast; at another, this after they had
had news of the approach of the Aūzbeg, they were for moving
on Shaibāq Khān himself, by forced marches and along a different
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>road,<a name="FNanchor_1276" id="FNanchor_1276"></a><a href="#Footnote_1276" class="fnanchor">1276</a>&mdash;which might have turned out an amazingly good idea!
But while they sit still there in Mashhad with nothing decided,
the Sult̤āns arrive by forced marches. The Mīrzās for their part
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;207.</span>array and go out; Abū’l-muḥsin Mīrzā is quickly overcome and
routed; Kūpuk Mīrzā charges his brother’s assailants with
somewhat few men; him too they carry off; both brothers are
dismounted and seated in one place; after an embrace (<i>qūchūsh</i>),
they kiss farewell; Abū’l-muḥsin shews some want of courage;
in Kūpuk Mirza it all makes no change at all. The heads of
both are sent to Shaibāq Khān in Pul-i-sālār.</p>

<p>(<i>h. Bābur marches for Qandahār.</i>)</p>

<p>In those days Shāh Beg and his younger brother Muḥammad
Muqīm, being afraid of Shaibāq Khān, sent one envoy after
another to me with dutiful letters (<i>‘arz-dāsht</i>), giving sign of
amity and good-wishes. Muqīm, in a letter of his own, explicitly
invited me. For us to look on at the Aūzbeg over-running the
whole country, was not seemly; and as by letters and envoys,
Shāh Beg and Muqīm had given me invitation, there remained
little doubt they would wait upon me.<a name="FNanchor_1277" id="FNanchor_1277"></a><a href="#Footnote_1277" class="fnanchor">1277</a> When all begs and
counsellors had been consulted, the matter was left at this:&mdash;We
were to get an army to horse, join the Arghūn begs and decide
in accord and agreement with them, whether to move into
Khurāsān or elsewhere as might seem good.</p>

<p>(<i>i. In Ghasnī and Qalāt-i-ghilzāī.</i>)</p>

<p>Ḥabība-sult̤ān Begīm, my aunt (<i>yīnkā</i>) as I used to call her,
met us in Ghaznī, having come from Herī, according to arrangement,
in order to bring her daughter Maṣ‘ūma-sult̤ān Begīm.
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;207b.</span>With the honoured Begīm came Khusrau Kūkūldāsh, Sl. Qulī
<i>Chūnāq</i> (One-eared) and Gadāī <i>Balāl</i> who had returned to me
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>after flight from Herī, first to Ibn-i-ḥusain Mīrzā then to Abū’l-muḥsin
Mīrzā,<a name="FNanchor_1278" id="FNanchor_1278"></a><a href="#Footnote_1278" class="fnanchor">1278</a> with neither of whom they could remain.</p>

<p>In Qalāt the army came upon a mass of Hindūstān traders,
come there to traffic and, as it seemed, unable to go on. The
general opinion about them was that people who, at a time of
such hostilities, are coming into an enemy’s country<a name="FNanchor_1279" id="FNanchor_1279"></a><a href="#Footnote_1279" class="fnanchor">1279</a> must be
plundered. With this however I did not agree; said I, “What
is the traders’ offence? If we, looking to God’s pleasure, leave
such scrapings of gain aside, the Most High God will apportion
our reward. It is now just as it was a short time back when we
rode out to raid the Ghiljī; many of you then were of one mind
to raid the Mahmand Afghāns, their sheep and goods, their
wives and families, just because they were within five miles of
you! Then as now I did not agree with you. On the very
next day the Most High God apportioned you more sheep
belonging to Afghān enemies, than had ever before fallen to the
share of the army.” Something by way of <i>peshkash</i> (offering)
was taken from each trader when we dismounted on the other
side of Qalāt.</p>

<p>(<i>j. Further march south.</i>)</p>

<p>Beyond Qalāt two Mīrzās joined us, fleeing from Qandahār.
One was Mīrzā Khān (Wais) who had been allowed to go into
Khurāsān after his defeat at Kābul. The other was ‘Abdu’r-razzāq<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;208.</span>
Mīrzā who had stayed on in Khurāsān when I left.
With them came and waited on me the mother of Jahāngīr
Mīrzā’s son Pīr-i-muḥammad, a grandson of Pahār Mīrzā.<a name="FNanchor_1280" id="FNanchor_1280"></a><a href="#Footnote_1280" class="fnanchor">1280</a></p>

<p>(<i>k. Behaviour of the Arghūn chiefs.</i>)</p>

<p>When we sent persons and letters to Shāh Beg and Muqīm,
saying, “Here we are at your word; a stranger-foe like the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>Aūzbeg has taken Khurāsān; come! let us settle, in concert
and amity, what will be for the general good,” they returned
a rude and ill-mannered answer, going back from the dutiful
letters they had written and from the invitations they had given.
One of their incivilities was that Shāh Beg stamped his letter to
me in the middle of its reverse, where begs seal if writing to begs,
where indeed a great beg seals if writing to one of the lower
circle.<a name="FNanchor_1281" id="FNanchor_1281"></a><a href="#Footnote_1281" class="fnanchor">1281</a> But for such ill-manners and his rude answers, his affair
would never have gone so far as it did, for, as they say,&mdash;</p>

<div class="line">A strife-stirring word will accomplish the downfall of an ancient line.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>By these their headstrong acts they gave to the winds house,
family, and the hoards of 30 to 40 years.</p>

<p>One day while we were near Shahr-i-ṣafā<a name="FNanchor_1282" id="FNanchor_1282"></a><a href="#Footnote_1282" class="fnanchor">1282</a> a false alarm being
given in the very heart of the camp, the whole army was made
to arm and mount. At the time I was occupied with a bath
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;208b.</span>and purification; the begs were much flurried; I mounted when
I was ready; as the alarm was false, it died away after a time.</p>

<p>March by march we moved on to Guzar.<a name="FNanchor_1283" id="FNanchor_1283"></a><a href="#Footnote_1283" class="fnanchor">1283</a> There we tried
again to discuss with the Arghūns but, paying no attention to
us, they maintained the same obstinate and perverse attitude.
Certain well-wishers who knew the local land and water, represented
to me, that the head of the torrents (<i>rūdlār</i>) which come
down to Qandahār, being towards Bābā Ḥasan Abdāl and
Khalishak,<a name="FNanchor_1284" id="FNanchor_1284"></a><a href="#Footnote_1284" class="fnanchor">1284</a> a move ought to be made in that direction, in order
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>to cut off (<i>yīqmāq</i>) all those torrents.<a name="FNanchor_1285" id="FNanchor_1285"></a><a href="#Footnote_1285" class="fnanchor">1285</a> Leaving the matter
there, we next day made our men put on their mail, arrayed in
right and left, and marched for Qandahār.</p>

<p>(<i>l. Battle of Qandahār.</i>)</p>

<p>Shāh Beg and Muqīm had seated themselves under an awning
which was set in front of the naze
of the Qandahār-hill where
I am now having a rock-residence cut out.<a name="FNanchor_1286" id="FNanchor_1286"></a><a href="#Footnote_1286" class="fnanchor">1286</a> Muqīm’s men
pushed forward amongst the trees to rather near us. T̤ūfān
<i>Arghūn</i> had fled to us when we were near Shahr-i-ṣafā; he now
betook himself alone close up to the Arghūn array to where
one named ‘Ashaqu’l-lāh was advancing rather fast leading 7 or
8 men. Alone, T̤ūfān <i>Arghūn</i> faced him, slashed swords with him,
unhorsed him, cut off his head and brought it to me as we were
passing Sang-i-lakhshak;<a name="FNanchor_1287" id="FNanchor_1287"></a><a href="#Footnote_1287" class="fnanchor">1287</a> an omen we accepted! Not thinking
it well to fight where we were, amongst suburbs and trees, we
went on along the skirt of the hill. Just as we had settled on
ground for the camp, in a meadow on the Qandahār side of the<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;209.</span>
torrent,<a name="FNanchor_1288" id="FNanchor_1288"></a><a href="#Footnote_1288" class="fnanchor">1288</a> opposite Khalishak, and were dismounting, Sher Qulī
the scout hurried up and represented that the enemy was
arrayed to fight and on the move towards us.</p>

<p>As on our march from Qalāt the army had suffered much
from hunger and thirst, most of the soldiers on getting near
Khalishak scattered up and down for sheep and cattle, grain
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>and eatables. Without looking to collect them, we galloped
off. Our force may have been 2000 in all, but perhaps not
over 1000 were in the battle because those mentioned as scattering
up and down could not rejoin in time to fight.</p>

<p>Though our men were few I had them organized and posted
on a first-rate plan and method; I had never arrayed them
before by such a good one. For my immediate command
(<i>khāṣa tābīn</i>) I had selected braves from whose hands comes
work<a name="FNanchor_1289" id="FNanchor_1289"></a><a href="#Footnote_1289" class="fnanchor">1289</a> and had inscribed them by tens and fifties, each ten and
each fifty under a leader who knew the post in the right or left
of the centre for his ten or his fifty, knew the work of each in
the battle, and was there on the observant watch; so that, after
mounting, the right and left, right and left hands, right and
left sides, charged right and left without the trouble of arraying
them or the need of a <i>tawāchī</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1290" id="FNanchor_1290"></a><a href="#Footnote_1290" class="fnanchor">1290</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;209b.</span>(<i>Author’s note on his terminology.</i>) Although <i>barānghār</i>, <i>aūng qūl</i>, <i>aūng
yān</i> and <i>aūng</i> (right wing, right hand, right side and right) all have the same
meaning, I have applied them in different senses in order to vary terms and
mark distinctions. As, in the battle-array, the (Ar.) <i>maimana</i> and <i>maisara</i>
<i>i.e.</i> what people call (Turkī) <i>barānghār</i> and <i>jawānghār</i> (r. and l. wings) are
not included in the (Ar.) <i>qalb</i>, <i>i.e.</i> what people call (T.) <i>ghūl</i> (centre), so it is
in arraying the centre itself. Taking the array of the centre only, its (Ar.)
<i>yamīn</i> and <i>yasār</i> (r. and l.) are called (by me) <i>aūng qūl</i> and <i>sūl qūl</i> (r. and l.
hands). Again,&mdash;the (Ar.) <i>khāṣa tābīn</i> (royal troop) in the centre has its
<i>yamīn</i> and <i>yasār</i> which are called (by me) <i>aūng yān</i> and <i>sūl yān</i> (r. and l.
sides, T. <i>yān</i>). Again,&mdash;in the <i>khāṣa tābīn</i> there is the (T.) <i>būī</i> (<i>nīng</i>) <i>tīkīnī</i>
(close circle); its <i>yamīn</i> and <i>yasār</i> are called <i>sūng</i> and <i>sūl</i>. In the Turkī
tongue they call one single thing a <i>būī</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1291" id="FNanchor_1291"></a><a href="#Footnote_1291" class="fnanchor">1291</a> but that is not the <i>būī</i> meant here;
what is meant here is close (<i>yāqīn</i>).</p></div>

<p>The right wing (<i>barānghār</i>) was Mīrzā Khān (Wais), Sherīm
T̤aghāī, Yārak T̤aghāī with his elder and younger brethren,
Chilma <i>Mughūl</i>, Ayūb Beg, Muḥammad Beg, Ibrāhīm Beg,
‘Alī Sayyid <i>Mughūl</i> with his Mughūls, Sl. Qulī <i>chuhra</i>,
Khudā-bakhsh and Abū’l-ḥasan with his elder and younger
brethren.</p>

<p>The left (<i>jawānghār</i>) was ‘Abdu’r-razzāq Mīrzā, Qāsim Beg,
Tīngrī-bīrdī, Qaṃbar-i-‘alī, Aḥmad <i>Aīlchī-būghā</i>, Ghūrī <i>Barlās</i>,
Sayyid Ḥusain Akbar, and Mīr Shāh <i>Qūchin</i>.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span></p>
<p>The advance (<i>aīrāwal</i>) was Nāṣir Mīrzā, Sayyid Qāsim Lord
of the Gate, Muḥibb-i-‘alī the armourer, Pāpā Aūghulī (Pāpā’s
son?), Allāh-wairan <i>Turkmān</i>, Sher Qulī <i>Mughūl</i> the scout
with his elder and younger brethren, and Muḥammad ‘Alī.</p>

<p>In the centre (<i>ghūl</i>), on my right hand, were Qāsim Kūkūldāsh,
Khusrau Kūkūldāsh, Sl. Muḥammad <i>Dūldāī</i>, Shāh Maḥmūd
the secretary, Qūl-i-bāyazīd the taster, and Kamāl the sherbet-server<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;210.</span>
server; on my left were Khwāja Muḥammad ‘Alī, Nāṣir’s Dost,
Nāṣir’s Mīrīm, Bābā Sher-zād, Khān-qulī, Walī the treasurer,
Qūtlūq-qadam the scout, Maqsūd the water-bearer (<i>sū-chī</i>), and
Bābā Shaikh. Those in the centre were all of my household;
there were no great begs; not one of those enumerated had
reached the rank of beg. Those inscribed in this <i>būī</i><a name="FNanchor_1292" id="FNanchor_1292"></a><a href="#Footnote_1292" class="fnanchor">1292</a> were
Sher Beg, Ḥātim the Armoury-master, Kūpuk, Qulī Bābā,
Abū’l-ḥasan the armourer;&mdash;of the Mughūls, Aūrūs (Russian)
‘Alī Sayyid,<a name="FNanchor_1293" id="FNanchor_1293"></a><a href="#Footnote_1293" class="fnanchor">1293</a> Darwīsh-i-‘alī Sayyid, Khūsh-kīldī, Chilma, Dost-kīldī,
Chilma <i>Tāghchī</i>, Dāmāchī, Mindī;&mdash;of the Turkmāns,
Manṣūr, Rustam-i-‘alī with his elder and younger brother, and
Shāh Nāz̤ir and Sīūndūk.</p>

<p>The enemy was in two divisions, one under Shāh Shujā’
<i>Arghūn</i>, known as Shāh Beg and hereafter to be written of
simply as Shāh Beg, the other under his younger brother
Muqīm.</p>

<p>Some estimated the dark mass of Arghūns<a name="FNanchor_1294" id="FNanchor_1294"></a><a href="#Footnote_1294" class="fnanchor">1294</a> at 6 or 7000
men; no question whatever but that Shāh Beg’s own men in
mail were 4 or 5000. He faced our right, Muqīm with a force
smaller may-be than his brother’s, faced our left. Muqīm made
a mightily strong attack on our left, that is on Qāsim Beg from
whom two or three persons came before fighting began, to ask
for reinforcement; we however could not detach a man because
in front of us also the enemy was very strong. We made our
onset without any delay; the enemy fell suddenly on our van,<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;210b.</span>
turned it back and rammed it on our centre. When we, after
a discharge of arrows, advanced, they, who also had been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>shooting for a time, seemed likely to make a stand (<i>tūkhtaghāndīk</i>).
Some-one, shouting to his men, came forward towards
me, dismounted and was for adjusting his arrow, but he could do
nothing because we moved on without stay. He remounted
and rode off; it may have been Shāh Beg himself. During the
fight Pīrī Beg <i>Turkmān</i> and 4 or 5 of his brethren turned their
faces from the foe and, turban in hand,<a name="FNanchor_1295" id="FNanchor_1295"></a><a href="#Footnote_1295" class="fnanchor">1295</a> came over to us.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(<i>Author’s note on Pīrī Beg.</i>) This Pīrī Beg was one of those Turkmāns
who came [into Herī] with the Turkmān Begs led by ‘Abdu’l-bāqī Mīrzā and
Murād Beg, after Shāh Ismā‘īl vanquished the Bāyandar sult̤āns and seized
the ‘Irāq countries.<a name="FNanchor_1296" id="FNanchor_1296"></a><a href="#Footnote_1296" class="fnanchor">1296</a></p></div>

<p>Our right was the first to overcome the foe; it made him
hurry off. Its extreme point had gone pricking (<i>sānjīlīb</i>)<a name="FNanchor_1297" id="FNanchor_1297"></a><a href="#Footnote_1297" class="fnanchor">1297</a> as
far as where I have now laid out a garden. Our left extended
as far as the great tree-tangled<a name="FNanchor_1298" id="FNanchor_1298"></a><a href="#Footnote_1298" class="fnanchor">1298</a> irrigation-channels, a good way
below Bābā Ḥasan Abdāl. Muqīm was opposite it, its numbers
very small compared with his. God brought it right! Between it
and Muqīm were three or four of the tree-tangled water-channels
going on to Qandahār;<a name="FNanchor_1299" id="FNanchor_1299"></a><a href="#Footnote_1299" class="fnanchor">1299</a> it held the crossing-place and allowed
no passage; small body though it was, it made splendid stand
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;211.</span>and kept its ground. Ḥalwāchī Tarkhān<a name="FNanchor_1300" id="FNanchor_1300"></a><a href="#Footnote_1300" class="fnanchor">1300</a> slashed away in the
water with Tīngrī-bīrdī and Qaṃbar-i-‘alī. Qaṃbar-i-‘alī was
wounded; an arrow stuck in Qāsim Beg’s forehead; another
struck Ghūrī <i>Barlās</i> above the eyebrow and came out above his
cheek.<a name="FNanchor_1301" id="FNanchor_1301"></a><a href="#Footnote_1301" class="fnanchor">1301</a></p>

<p>We meantime, after putting our adversary to flight, had
crossed those same channels towards the naze of Murghān-koh
(Birds'-hill). Some-one on a grey <i>tīpūchāq</i> was going backwards
and forwards irresolutely along the hill-skirt, while we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>were getting across; I likened him to Shāh Beg; seemingly it
was he.</p>

<p>Our men having beaten their opponents, all went off to
pursue and unhorse them. Remained with me eleven to count,
‘Abdu’l-lāh the librarian being one. Muqīm was still keeping
his ground and fighting. Without a glance at the fewness of
our men, we had the nagarets sounded and, putting our trust in
God, moved with face set for Muqīm.</p>

<p>Learning from the nagarets that we were approaching, Muqīm
forgot his fixed plan and took the road of flight. God brought
it right!</p>

<p>After putting our foe to flight, we moved for Qandahār and
dismounted in Farrukh-zād Beg’s Chār-bāgh, of which at this
time not a trace remains!</p>

<p>(<i>m. Bābur enters Qandahār.</i>)<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;211b.</span></p>

<p>Shāh Beg and Muqīm could not get into Qandahār when
they took to flight; Shāh Beg went towards Shāl and Mastūng
(Quetta), Muqīm towards Zamīn-dāwar. They left no-one able
to make the fort fast. Aḥmad ‘Alī Tarkhān was in it together
with other elder and younger brethren of Qulī Beg <i>Arghūn</i>
whose attachment and good-feeling for me were known. After
parley they asked protection for the families of their elder and
younger brethren; their request was granted and all mentioned
were encompassed with favour. They then opened the Māshūr-gate
of the town; with leaderless men in mind, no other was
opened. At that gate were posted Sherīm T̤aghāī and Yārīm Beg.
I went in with a few of the household, charged the leaderless
men and had two or three put to death by way of example.<a name="FNanchor_1302" id="FNanchor_1302"></a><a href="#Footnote_1302" class="fnanchor">1302</a></p>

<p>(<i>n. The spoils of Qandahār.</i>)</p>

<p>I got to Muqīm’s treasury first, that being in the outer-fort;
‘Abdu’r-razzāq Mīrzā must have been quicker than I, for he was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>just dismounting there when I arrived; I gave him a few things
from it. I put Dost-i-nāṣir Beg, Qul-i-bāyazīd the taster and,
of pay-masters, Muḥammad <i>bakhshī</i> in charge of it, then passed
on into the citadel and posted Khwāja Muḥammad ‘Alī, Shāh
Maḥmūd and, of the pay-masters, T̤aghāī Shāh <i>bakhshī</i> in
charge of Shāh Beg’s treasury.</p>

<p>Nāṣir’s Mīrīm and Maqṣūd the sherbet-server were sent to
keep the house of Ẕū’n-nūn’s <i>Dīwān</i> Mīr Jān for Nāṣir Mīrzā;

<p><span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;212.</span>Such masses of white money had never been seen in those
countries; no-one indeed was to be heard of who had seen so
much. That night, when we ourselves stayed in the citadel,
Shāh Beg’s slave Saṃbhal was captured and brought in.
Though he was then Shāh Beg’s intimate, he had not yet
received his later favour.<a name="FNanchor_1304" id="FNanchor_1304"></a><a href="#Footnote_1304" class="fnanchor">1304</a> I had him given into someone’s
charge but as good watch was not kept, he was allowed to
escape. Next day I went back to my camp in Farrukh-zād
Beg’s Chār-bāgh.</p>

<p>I gave the Qandahār country to Nāṣir Mīrzā. After the
treasure had been got into order, loaded up and started off, he
took the loads of white <i>tankas</i> off a string of camels (<i>i.e.</i> <i>7</i> beasts)
at the citadel-treasury, and kept them. I did not demand them
back; I just gave them to him.</p>

<p>On leaving Qandahār, we dismounted in the Qūsh-khāna
meadow. After setting the army forward, I had gone for an
excursion, so I got into camp rather late. It was another camp!
not to be recognized! Excellent <i>tīpūchāqs</i>, strings and strings
of he-camels, she-camels, and mules, bearing saddle-bags (<i>khurzīn</i>)
of silken stuffs and cloth,&mdash;tents of scarlet (cloth) and
velvet, all sorts of awnings, every kind of work-shop, ass-load
after ass-load of chests! The goods of the elder and younger

In <i>aūtāgh</i> and <i>chādar</i> (lattice-tent and pole-tent) was much
spoil for every man soever; many sheep also had been taken
but sheep were less cared about!</p>

<p>I made over to Qāsim Beg Muqīm’s retainers in Qalāt, under<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;212b.</span>
Qūj <i>Arghūn</i> and Tāju’d-dīn Maḥmūd, with their goods and
effects. Qāsim Beg was a knowing person; he saw it unadvisable
for us to stay long near Qandahār, so, by talking and
talking, worrying and worrying, he got us to march off. As has
been said, I had bestowed Qandahār on Nāṣir Mīrzā; he was
given leave to go there; we started for Kābul.</p>

<p>There had been no chance of portioning out the spoils while
we were near Qandahār; it was done at Qarā-bāgh where we
delayed two or three days. To count the coins being difficult,
they were apportioned by weighing them in scales. Begs of all
ranks, retainers and household (<i>tābīn</i>) loaded up ass-load after
ass-load of sacks full of white <i>tankas</i>, and took them away for
their own subsistence and the pay of their soldiers.</p>

<p>We went back to Kābul with masses of goods and treasure,
great honour and reputation.</p>

<p>(<i>o. Bābur’s marriage with Ma‘ṣūma-sult̤ān.</i>)</p>

<p>After this return to Kābul I concluded alliance (<i>‘aqd qīldīm</i>)
with Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā’s daughter Ma‘ṣūma-sult̤ān Begīm whom
I had asked in marriage at Khurāsān, and had had brought
from there.</p>

<p>(<i>p. Shaibāq Khān before Qandahār.</i>)</p>

<p>A few days later a servant of Nāṣir Mīrzā brought the news
that Shaibāq Khān had come and laid siege to Qandahār.
That Muqīm had fled to Zamīn-dāwar has been said already;
from there he went on and saw Shaibāq Khān. From Shāh
Beg also one person after another had gone to Shaibāq Khān.
At the instigation and petition of these two, the Khān came<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;213.</span>
swiftly down on Qandahār by the mountain road,<a name="FNanchor_1305" id="FNanchor_1305"></a><a href="#Footnote_1305" class="fnanchor">1305</a> thinking to
find me there. This was the very thing that experienced person</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span></p>
<p>Qāsim Beg had in his mind when he worried us into marching
off from near Qandahār.</p>

<p>Shaibāq Khān arriving, besieged Nāṣir Mīrzā in Qandahār.</p>

<p>(<i>q. Alarm in Kābul.</i>)</p>

<p>When this news came, the begs were summoned for counsel.
The matters for discussion were these:&mdash;Strangers and ancient
foes, such as are Shaibāq Khān and the Aūzbegs, are in possession
of all the countries once held by Tīmūr Beg’s descendants;
even where Turks and Chaghatāīs<a name="FNanchor_1306" id="FNanchor_1306"></a><a href="#Footnote_1306" class="fnanchor">1306</a> survive in corners and
border-lands, they have all joined the Aūzbeg, willingly or with
aversion; one remains, I myself, in Kābul, the foe mightily
strong, I very weak, with no means of making terms, no strength
to oppose; that, in the presence of such power and potency, we
had to think of some place for ourselves and, at this crisis and
in the crack of time there was, to put a wider space between us
and the strong foeman; that choice lay between Badakhshān
and Hindūstān and that decision must now be made.</p>

<p>Qāsim Beg and Sherīm T̤aghāī were agreed for Badakhshān;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(<i>Author’s note on Badakhshān.</i>) Those holding their heads up in
Badakhshān at this crisis were, of Badakhshīs, Mubārak Shāh and Zubair,
Jahāngīr <i>Turkmān</i> and Muḥammad the armourer. They had driven Nāṣir
Mīrzā out but had not joined the Aūzbeg.</p></div>

<p><span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;213b.</span>I and several household-begs preferred going towards Hindūstān
and were for making a start to Lamghān.<a name="FNanchor_1307" id="FNanchor_1307"></a><a href="#Footnote_1307" class="fnanchor">1307</a></p>

<p>(<i>r. Movements of some Mīrzās.</i>)</p>

<p>After taking Qandahār, I had bestowed Qalāt and the Turnūk
(Tarnak) country on ‘Abdu’r-razzāq Mīrzā and had left him in
Qalāt, but with the Aūzbeg besieging Qandahār, he could not
stay in Qalāt, so left it and came to Kābul. He arriving just
as we were marching out, was there left in charge.<a name="FNanchor_1308" id="FNanchor_1308"></a><a href="#Footnote_1308" class="fnanchor">1308</a></p>

<p>There being in Badakhshān no ruler or ruler’s son, Mīrzā Khān
inclined to go in that direction, both because of his relationship
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>to Shāh Begīm<a name="FNanchor_1309" id="FNanchor_1309"></a><a href="#Footnote_1309" class="fnanchor">1309</a> and with her approval. He was allowed to go and
the honoured Begīm herself started off with him. My honoured
maternal-aunt Mihr-nigār Khānīm also wished to go to Badakhshān,
notwithstanding that it was more seemly for her to be with
me, a blood-relation; but whatever objection was made, she was
not to be dissuaded; she also betook<a name="FNanchor_1310" id="FNanchor_1310"></a><a href="#Footnote_1310" class="fnanchor">1310</a> herself to Badakhshān.</p>

<p>(<i>s. Bābur’s second start for Hindūstān.</i>)</p>

<p>Under our plan of going to Hindūstān, we marched out of
Kābul in the month of the first Jumāda (September 1507 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>),
taking the road through Little Kābul and going down by
Sūrkh-rabāt̤ to Qūrūq-sāī.</p>

<p>The Afghāns belonging between Kābul and Lamghān (Ningnahār)
are thieves and abettors of thieves even in quiet times;
for just such a happening as this they had prayed in vain.
Said they, “He has abandoned Kābul”, and multiplied their
misdeeds by ten, changing their very merits for faults. To such<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;214.</span>
lengths did things go that on the morning we marched from
Jagdālīk, the Afghāns located between it and Lamghān, such as
the Khiẓr-khail, Shimū-khail, Khirilchī and Khūgīanī, thought
of blocking the pass, arrayed on the mountain to the north, and
advancing with sound of tambour and flourish of sword, began
to shew themselves off. On our mounting I ordered our men
to move along the mountain-side, each man from where he had
dismounted;<a name="FNanchor_1311" id="FNanchor_1311"></a><a href="#Footnote_1311" class="fnanchor">1311</a> off they set at the gallop up every ridge and
every valley of the saddle.<a name="FNanchor_1312" id="FNanchor_1312"></a><a href="#Footnote_1312" class="fnanchor">1312</a> The Afghāns stood awhile, but
could not let even one arrow fly,<a name="FNanchor_1313" id="FNanchor_1313"></a><a href="#Footnote_1313" class="fnanchor">1313</a> and betook themselves to
flight. While I was on the mountain during the pursuit, I shot
one in the hand as he was running back below me. That
arrow-stricken man and a few others were brought in; some
were put to death by impalement, as an example.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span></p>
<p>We dismounted over against the Adīnapūr-fort in the Nīngnahār
<i>tūmān</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>t. A raid for winter stores.</i>)</p>

<p>Up till then we had taken no thought where to camp, where
to go, where to stay; we had just marched up and down,
camping in fresh places, while waiting for news.<a name="FNanchor_1314" id="FNanchor_1314"></a><a href="#Footnote_1314" class="fnanchor">1314</a> It was late
in the autumn; most lowlanders had carried in their rice.
People knowing the local land and water represented that
the Mīl Kāfirs up the water of the ‘Alīshang <i>tūmān</i> grow great
quantities of rice, so that we might be able to collect winter
supplies from them for the army. Accordingly we rode out of
the Nīngnahār dale (<i>julga</i>), crossed (the Bārān-water) at Sāīkal,
and went swiftly as far as the Pūr-amīn (easeful) valley.
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;214b.</span>There the soldiers took a mass of rice. The rice-fields were all
at the bottom of the hills. The people fled but some Kāfirs
went to their death. A few of our braves had been sent to
a look-out (<i>sar-kūb</i>)<a name="FNanchor_1315" id="FNanchor_1315"></a><a href="#Footnote_1315" class="fnanchor">1315</a> on a naze of the Pūr-anīm valley; when
they were returning to us, the Kāfirs rushed from the hill above,
shooting at them. They overtook Qāsim Beg’s son-in-law
Pūrān, chopped at him with an axe, and were just taking him
when some of the braves went back, brought strength to bear,
drove them off and got Pūrān away. After one night spent in
the Kāfirs’ rice-fields, we returned to camp with a mass of provisions
collected.</p>

<p>(<i>u. Marriage of Muqīm’s daughter.</i>)</p>

<p>While we were near Mandrāwar in those days, an alliance
was concluded between Muqīm’s daughter Māh-chūchūk, now
married to Shāh Ḥasan <i>Arghūn</i>, and Qāsim Kūkūldāsh.<a name="FNanchor_1316" id="FNanchor_1316"></a><a href="#Footnote_1316" class="fnanchor">1316</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span></p>

<p>(<i>v. Abandonment of the Hindūstān project.</i>)</p>

<p>As it was not found desirable to go on into Hindūstān, I sent
Mullā Bābā of Pashāghar back to Kābul with a few braves.
Meantime I marched from near Mandrāwar to Atar and Shīwa
and lay there for a few days. From Atar I visited Kūnār and
Nūr-gal; from Kūnār I went back to camp on a raft; it was
the first time I had sat on one; it pleased me much, and the
raft came into common use thereafter.</p>

<p>(<i>w. Shaibāq Khān retires from Qandahār.</i>)</p>

<p>In those same days Mullā Bābā of Farkat came from Nāṣir
Mīrzā with news in detail that Shaibāq Khān, after taking the
outer-fort of Qandahār, had not been able to take the citadel
but had retired; also that the Mīrzā, on various accounts, had
left Qandahār and gone to Ghaznī.</p>

<p>Shaibāq Khān’s arrival before Qandahār, within a few days<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;215.</span>
of our own departure, had taken the garrison by surprise, and
they had not been able to make fast the outer-fort. He ran
mines several times round about the citadel and made several
assaults. The place was about to be lost. At that anxious
time Khwāja Muḥ. Amīn, Khwāja Dost Khāwand, Muḥ. ‘Alī,
a foot-soldier, and Shāmī (Syrian?) let themselves down from the
walls and got away. Just as those in the citadel were about to
surrender in despair, Shaibāq Khān interposed words of peace
and uprose from before the place. Why he rose was this:&mdash;It
appears that before he went there, he had sent his <i>ḥaram</i> to
Nīrah-tū,<a name="FNanchor_1317" id="FNanchor_1317"></a><a href="#Footnote_1317" class="fnanchor">1317</a> and that in Nīrah-tū some-one lifted up his head and
got command in the fort; the Khān therefore made a sort of
peace and retired from Qandahār.</p>

<p>(<i>x. Bābur returns to Kābul.</i>)</p>

<p>Mid-winter though it was we went back to Kābul by the
Bād-i-pīch road. I ordered the date of that transit and that
crossing of the pass to be cut on a stone above Bād-i-pīch;<a name="FNanchor_1318" id="FNanchor_1318"></a><a href="#Footnote_1318" class="fnanchor">1318</a>
Ḥāfiẓ Mīrak wrote the inscription, Ustād Shāh Muḥammad did
the cutting, not well though, through haste.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span></p>
<p>I bestowed Ghaznī on Nāṣir Mīrzā and gave ‘Abdu’r-razzāq
Mīrzā the Nīngnahār <i>tūmān</i> with Mandrāwar, Nūr-valley, Kūnār
and Nūr-gal.<a name="FNanchor_1319" id="FNanchor_1319"></a><a href="#Footnote_1319" class="fnanchor">1319</a></p>

<p>(<i>y. Bābur styles himself Pādshāh.</i>)</p>

<p>Up to that date people had styled Tīmūr Beg’s descendants

<p>At the end of this year, on Tuesday the 4th day of the month

<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;215b.</span>(<i>Ḥūt</i>), Humāyūn was born in the citadel of Kābul. The date
of his birth was found by the poet Maulānā Masnadī in the
words <i>Sult̤ān Humāyūn Khān</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1321" id="FNanchor_1321"></a><a href="#Footnote_1321" class="fnanchor">1321</a> and a minor poet of Kābul
found it in <i>Shāh-i-fīrūs-qadr</i> (Shāh of victorious might). A few
days later he received the name Humāyūn; when he was five
or six days old, I went out to the Chār-bāgh where was had
the feast of his nativity. All the begs, small and great, brought
gifts; such a mass of white <i>tankas</i> was heaped up as had never
been seen before. It was a first-rate feast!</p>

<p>A few days after our return from that raid, Qūj Beg, Faqīr-i-‘alī,
Karīm-dād and Bābā <i>chuhra</i> were thinking about
deserting, but their design becoming known, people were sent
who took them below Astarghach. As good-for-nothing words
of theirs had been reported to me, even during Jahāngīr M.’s
life-time,<a name="FNanchor_1324" id="FNanchor_1324"></a><a href="#Footnote_1324" class="fnanchor">1324</a> I ordered that they should be put to death at the top

been fixed; and they were about to be hanged when Qāsim
Beg sent Khalīfa to me with an urgent entreaty that I would
pardon their offences. To please him I gave them their lives,
but I ordered them kept in custody.</p>

these, after consultation, took up a bad position towards me.
They were all seated in front of Khwāja Riwāj, from the Sūng-qūrghān

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span></p><p>Earlier on Muḥibb-i-‘alī the armourer had told Khalīfa and
Mullā Bābā once or twice of their assemblies, and both had
given me a hint, but the thing seeming incredible, it had had no
attention. One night, towards the Bed-time Prayer, when I was
sitting in the Audience-hall of the Chār-bāgh, Mūsa Khwāja,
coming swiftly up with another man, said in my ear, “The
Mughūls are really rebelling! We do not know for certain
whether they have got ‘Abdu’r-razzāq M. to join them. They
have not settled to rise to-night.” I feigned disregard and a

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">TRANSLATOR’S NOTE ON 914 to 925 AH.&mdash;1508 to 1519 AD.</span></p>

<p>From several references made in the <i>Bābur-nāma</i> and from
a passage in Gul-badan’s <i>Humāyūn-nāma</i> (f. 15), it is inferrible
that Bābur was composing the annals of 914 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> not long
before his last illness and death.<a name="FNanchor_1331" id="FNanchor_1331"></a><a href="#Footnote_1331" class="fnanchor">1331</a></p>

<p>Before the diary of 925 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (1519 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>) takes up the broken
thread of his autobiography, there is a <i>lacuna</i> of narrative
extending over nearly eleven years. The break was not
intended, several references in the <i>Bābur-nāma</i> shewing
Bābur’s purpose to describe events of the unchronicled years.<a name="FNanchor_1332" id="FNanchor_1332"></a><a href="#Footnote_1332" class="fnanchor">1332</a>
Mr. Erskine, in the Leyden and Erskine <i>Memoirs</i>, carried
Bābur’s biography through the major <i>lacunæ</i>, but without firsthand
help from the best sources, the <i>Habību’s-siyar</i> and <i>Tārīkh-i-rashīdī</i>.
He had not the help of the first even in his <i>History
of India</i>. M. de Courteille working as a translator only, made
no attempt to fill the gaps.</p>

<p>Bābur’s biography has yet to be completed; much time is
demanded by the task, not only in order to exhaust known
sources and seek others further afield, but to weigh and balance
the contradictory statements of writers deep-sundered in
sympathy and outlook. To strike such a balance is essential
when dealing with the events of 914 to 920 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> because in those
years Bābur had part in an embittered conflict between Sunni
and Shī‘a. What I offer below, as a stop-gap, is a mere
summary of events, mainly based on material not used by
Mr. Erskine, with a few comments prompted by acquaintance
with Bāburiana.</p>

<h3><i>USEFUL SOURCES</i></h3>

<p>Compared with what Bābur could have told of this most
interesting period of his life, the yield of the sources is scant,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>a natural sequel from the fact that no one of them had his
biography for its main theme, still less had his own action in
crises of enforced ambiguity.</p>

<p>Of all known sources the best are Khwānd-amīr’s <i>Ḥabību’s-siyar</i>
and Ḥaidar Mīrzā <i>Dūghlāt’s Tārīkh-i-rashīdī</i>. The first
was finished nominally in 930 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (1524-5 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>), seven years
therefore before Bābur’s death, but it received much addition of
matter concerning Bābur after its author went to Hindūstān in
934 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (f. 339). Its fourth part, a life of Shāh Ismā‘īl <i>Ṣafawī</i>
is especially valuable for the years of this <i>lacuna</i>. Ḥaidar’s
book was finished under Humāyūn in 953 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (1547 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>), when
its author had reigned five years in Kashmīr. It is the most
valuable of all the sources for those interested in Bābur himself,
both because of Ḥaidar’s excellence as a biographer, and through
his close acquaintance with Bābur’s family. From his eleventh
to his thirteenth year he lived under Bābur’s protection, followed
this by 19 years service under Sa‘īd Khān, the cousin of both,
in Kāshghar, and after that Khān’s death, went to Bābur’s sons
Kāmrān and Humāyūn in Hindūstān.</p>

<p>A work issuing from a Sunnī Aūzbeg centre, Faẓl bin
Ruzbahān <i>Isfahānī’s Sūlūku’l-mulūk</i>, has a Preface of special
value, as shewing one view of what it writes of as the spread of
heresy in Māwarā’u’n-nahr through Bābur’s invasions. The
book itself is a Treatise on Musalmān Law, and was prepared
by order of ‘Ubaidu’l-lāh Khān <i>Aūzbeg</i> for his help in fulfilling
a vow he had made, before attacking Bābur in 918 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>, at the
shrine of Khwāja Aḥmad <i>Yasawī</i> [in Ḥaẓrat Turkistān], that,
if he were victorious, he would conform exactly with the divine
Law and uphold it in Māwarā’u’n-nahr (Rieu’s Pers. Cat. ii, 448).</p>

<p>The <i>Tārīkh-i Ḥājī Muḥammad ‘Ārif Qandahārī</i> appears,
from the frequent use Firishta made of it, to be a useful source,
both because its author was a native of Qandahār, a place much
occupying Bābur’s activities, and because he was a servant of
Bairām Khān-i-khānān, whose assassination under Akbar he
witnessed.<a name="FNanchor_1333" id="FNanchor_1333"></a><a href="#Footnote_1333" class="fnanchor">1333</a> Unfortunately, though his life of Akbar survives
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>no copy is now known of the section of his General History
which deals with Bābur’s.</p>

<p>An early source is Yahya <i>Kazwīnī’s Lubbu’t-tawārīkh</i>, written
in 948 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (1541 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>), but brief only in the Bābur period. It
issued from a Shī‘a source, being commanded by Shāh Ismā‘īl

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">914 AH.-MAY 2nd 1508 to APRIL 21st 1509 AD.</span></p>

<p>The mutiny, of which an account begins in the text, was
crushed by the victory of 500 loyalists over 3,000 rebels, one
factor of success being Bābur’s defeat in single combat of five
champions of his adversaries.<a name="FNanchor_1334" id="FNanchor_1334"></a><a href="#Footnote_1334" class="fnanchor">1334</a> The disturbance was not of long
duration; Kābul was tranquil in Sha‘bān (November) when
Sl. Sa‘īd Khān <i>Chaghatāī</i>, then 21, arrived there seeking his
cousin’s protection, after defeat by his brother Manṣūr at Almātū,
escape from death, commanded by Shaibānī, in Farghāna,
a winter journey through Qarā-tīgīn to Mīrzā Khān in Qilā'-i-z̤afar,
refusal of an offer to put him in that feeble Mīrzā’s place,
and so on to Kābul, where he came a destitute fugitive and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>enjoyed a freedom from care never known by him before
(f. 200<i>b</i>; T.R. p. 226). The year was fatal to his family and
to Ḥaidar’s; in it Shaibānī murdered Sl. Maḥmūd Khān and
his six sons, Muḥammad Ḥusain Mīrzā and other Dūghlāt
sult̤āns.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">915 AH.-APRIL 21st 1509 to APRIL 11th 1510 AD.</span></p>

<p>In this year hostilities began between Shāh Ismā‘īl <i>Ṣafawī</i>
and Muḥ. Shaibānī Khān <i>Aūzbeg</i>, news of which must have
excited keen interest in Kābul.</p>

<p>In it occurred also what was in itself a minor matter of
a child’s safety, but became of historical importance, namely,
the beginning of personal acquaintance between Bābur and his
sympathetic biographer Ḥaidar Mīrzā <i>Dūghlāt</i>. Ḥaidar, like
Sa‘īd, came a fugitive to the protection of a kinsman; he was
then eleven, had been saved by servants from the death commanded
by Shaibānī, conveyed to Mīrzā Khān in Badakhshān,
thence sent for by Bābur to the greater security of Kābul (f. 11;
Index <i>s.n.</i>; T.R. p. 227).</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">916 AH.-APRIL 11th 1510 to MARCH 31st 1510 AD.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><i>a. News of the battle of Merv.</i></p>

<p>Over half of this year passed quietly in Kābul; Ramẓān
(December) brought from Mīrzā Khān (Wāis) the stirring
news that Ismā‘īl had defeated Shaibānī near Merv.<a name="FNanchor_1335" id="FNanchor_1335"></a><a href="#Footnote_1335" class="fnanchor">1335</a> “It
is not known,” wrote the Mīrzā, “whether Shāhī Beg Khān has
been killed or not. All the Aūzbegs have crossed the Amū.
Amīr Aūrūs, who was in Qūndūz, has fled. About 20,000
Mughūls, who left the Aūzbeg at Merv, have come to Qūndūz.
I have come there.” He then invited Bābur to join him and
with him to try for the recovery of their ancestral territories
(T.R. p. 237).</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent"><i>b. Bābur’s campaign in Transoxiana begun.</i></p>

<p>The Mīrzā’s letter was brought over passes blocked by snow;
Bābur, with all possible speed, took the one winter-route through
Āb-dara, kept the Ramẓān Feast in Bāmīān, and reached
Qūndūz in Shawwāl (Jan. 1511 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>). Ḥaidar’s detail about the
Feast seems likely to have been recorded because he had read
Bābur’s own remark, made in Ramẓān 933 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (June 1527) that
up to that date, when he kept it in Sīkrī, he had not since his
eleventh year kept it twice in the same place (f. 330).</p>

<p class="indent"><i>c. Mughūl affairs.</i></p>

<p>Outside Qūndūz lay the Mughūls mentioned by Mīrzā Khān
as come from Merv and so mentioned, presumably, as a possible
reinforcement. They had been servants of Bābur’s uncles
Maḥmūd and Aḥmad, and when Shaibānī defeated those Khāns
at Akhsī in 908 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>, had been compelled by him to migrate
into Khurāsān to places remote from Mughūlistān. Many of
them had served in Kāshghar; none had served a Tīmūrid
Mīrzā. Set free by Shaibānī’s death, they had come east,
a Khān-less 20,000 of armed and fully equipped men and they
were there, as Ḥaidar says, in their strength while of Chaghatāīs
there were not more than 5,000. They now, and with them the
Mughūls from Kābul, used the opportunity offering for return
to a more congenial location and leadership, by the presence in
Qūndūz of a legitimate Khāqān and the clearance in Andijān,
a threshold of Mughūlistān, of its Aūzbeg governors (f. 200<i>b</i>).
The chiefs of both bodies of Mughūls, Sherīm Taghāī at the
head of one, Ayūb <i>Begchīk</i> of the other, proffered the Mughūl
Khānship to Sa‘īd with offer to set Bābur aside, perhaps to kill
him. It is improbable that in making their offer they contemplated
locating themselves in the confined country of Kābul;
what they seem to have wished was what Bābur gave, Sa‘īd for
their Khāqān and permission to go north with him.</p>

<p>Sa‘īd, in words worth reading, rejected their offer to injure
Bābur, doing so on the grounds of right and gratitude, but, the
two men agreeing that it was now expedient for them to part,
asked to be sent to act for Bābur where their friendship could
be maintained for their common welfare. The matter was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
settled by Bābur’s sending him into Andijān in response to an
urgent petition for help there just arrived from Ḥaidar’s uncle.
He “was made Khān” and started forth in the following year,
on Ṣafar 14th 917 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (May 13th 1511 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>); with him went
most of the Mughūls but not all, since even of those from Merv,
Ayūb <i>Begchīk</i> and others are found mentioned on several later
occasions as being with Bābur.</p>

<p>Bābur’s phrase “I made him Khān” (f. 200<i>b</i>) recalls his
earlier mention of what seems to be the same appointment
(f. 10<i>b</i>), made by Abū-sa‘īd of Yūnas as Khān of the Mughūls;
in each case the meaning seems to be that the Tīmūrid Mīrzā
made the Chaghatāī Khān Khāqān of the Mughūls.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>d. First attempt on Ḥiṣār.</i></p>

<p>After spending a short time in Qūndūz, Bābur moved for
Ḥiṣār in which were the Aūzbeg sult̤āns Mahdī and Ḥamza.
They came out into Wakhsh to meet him but, owing to an
imbroglio, there was no encounter and each side retired (T.R.
p. 238).</p>

<p class="indent"><i>e. Intercourse between Bābur and Ismā‘īl Ṣafawī.</i></p>

<p>While Bābur was now in Qūndūz his sister Khān-zāda
arrived there, safe-returned under escort of the Shāh’s troops,
after the death in the battle of Merv of her successive husbands
Shaibānī and Sayyid Hādī, and with her came an envoy from
Ismā‘īl proffering friendship, civilities calculated to arouse a
hope of Persian help in Bābur. To acknowledge his courtesies,
Bābur sent Mīrzā Khān with thanks and gifts; Ḥaidar says
that the Mīrzā also conveyed protestations of good faith and
a request for military assistance. He was well received and his
request for help was granted; that it was granted under hard
conditions then stated later occurrences shew.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">917 AH.-MARCH 31st 1511 to MARCH 19th 1512 AD.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><i>a. Second attempt on Ḥiṣār.</i></p>

<p>In this year Bābur moved again on Ḥiṣār. He took post,
where once his forbear Tīmūr had wrought out success against
great odds, at the Pul-i-sangīn (Stone-bridge) on the Sūrkh-āb,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
and lay there a month awaiting reinforcement. The Aūzbeg
sult̤āns faced him on the other side of the river, they too,
presumably, awaiting reinforcement. They moved when they
felt themselves strong enough to attack, whether by addition to
their own numbers, whether by learning that Bābur had not
largely increased his own. Concerning the second alternative
it is open to surmise that he hoped for larger reinforcement
than he obtained; he appears to have left Qūndūz before the
return of Mīrzā Khān from his embassy to Ismā‘īl, to have
expected Persian reinforcement with the Mīrzā, and at Pul-i-sangīn,
where the Mīrzā joined him in time to fight, to have
been strengthened by the Mīrzā’s own following, and few, if
any, foreign auxiliaries. These surmises are supported by what
Khwānd-amīr relates of the conditions [specified later] on which
the Shāh’s main contingent was despatched and by his shewing
that it did not start until after the Shāh had had news of the
battle at Pul-i-sangīn.</p>

<p>At the end of the month of waiting, the Aūzbegs one morning
swam the Sūrkh-āb below the bridge; in the afternoon of the
same day, Bābur retired to better ground amongst the mountain
fastnesses of a local Āb-dara. In the desperate encounter which
followed the Aūzbegs were utterly routed with great loss in
men; they were pursued to Darband-i-ahanīn (Iron-gate) on
the Ḥiṣār border, on their way to join a great force assembled
at Qarshī under Kūchūm Khān, Shaibānī’s successor as Aūzbeg
Khāqān. The battle is admirably described by Ḥaidar, who
was then a boy of 12 with keen eye watching his own first fight,
and that fight with foes who had made him the last male
survivor of his line. In the evening of the victory Mahdī,
Ḥamza and Ḥamza’s son Mamak were brought before Bābur
who, says Ḥaidar, did to them what they had done to the
Mughūl Khāqāns and Chaghatāī Sult̤āns, that is, he retaliated
in blood for the blood of many kinsmen.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>b. Persian reinforcement.</i></p>

<p>After the battle Bābur went to near Ḥiṣār, was there joined
by many local tribesmen, and, some time later, by a large body
of Ismā‘īl’s troops under Aḥmad Beg <i>Ṣafawī</i>, ‘Alī Khān <i>Istiljū</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
and Shāhrukh Sl. <i>Afshār</i>, Ismā‘īl’s seal-keeper. The following
particulars, given by Khwānd-amīr, about the despatch of this
contingent help to fix the order of occurrences, and throw light
on the price paid by Bābur for his auxiliaries. He announced
his victory over Mahdī and Ḥamza to the Shāh, and at the
same time promised that if he reconquered the rest of Transoxiana
by the Shāh’s help, he would read his name in the
<i>khut̤ba</i>, stamp it on coins together with those of the Twelve
Imāms, and work to destroy the power of the Aūzbegs. These
undertakings look like a response to a demand; such conditions
cannot have been proffered; their acceptance must have been
compelled. Khwānd-amīr says that when Ismā‘īl fully understood
the purport of Bābur’s letter, [by which would seem to be
meant, when he knew that his conditions of help were accepted,]
he despatched the troops under the three Commanders named
above.</p>

<p>The Persian chiefs advised a move direct on Bukhārā and
Samarkand; and with this Bābur’s councillors concurred, they
saying, according to Ḥaidar, that Bukhārā was then empty of
troops and full of fools. ‘Ubaid Khān had thrown himself into
Qarshī; it was settled not to attack him but to pass on and
encamp a stage beyond the town. This was done; then scout
followed scout, bringing news that he had come out of Qarshī
and was hurrying to Bukhārā, his own fief. Instant and swift
pursuit followed him up the 100 miles of caravan-road, into
Bukhārā, and on beyond, sweeping him and his garrison,
plundered as they fled, into the open land of Turkistān. Many
sult̤āns had collected in Samarkand, some no doubt being, like
Tīmūr its governor, fugitives escaped from Pul-i-sangīn. Dismayed
by Bābur’s second success, they scattered into Turkistān,
thus leaving him an open road.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>c. Samarkand re-occupied and relations with Ismā‘īl Ṣafawī.</i></p>

<p>He must now have hoped to be able to dispense with his
dangerous colleagues, for he dismissed them when he reached
Bukhārā, with gifts and thanks for their services. It is Ḥaidar,
himself present, who fixes Bukhārā as the place of the dismissal
(T.R. p. 246).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span></p>

<p>From Bukhārā Bābur went to Samarkand. It was mid-Rajab
917 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (October 1511 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>), some ten months after leaving
Kābul, and after 9 years of absence, that he re-entered the town,
itself gay with decoration for his welcome, amidst the acclaim of
its people.<a name="FNanchor_1336" id="FNanchor_1336"></a><a href="#Footnote_1336" class="fnanchor">1336</a></p>

<p>Eight months were to prove his impotence to keep it against
the forces ranged against him,&mdash;Aūzbeg strength in arms compacted
by Sunnī zeal, Sunnī hatred of a Shī‘a’s suzerainty
intensified by dread lest that potent Shī‘a should resolve to
perpetuate his dominance. Both as a Sunnī and as one who
had not owned a suzerain, the position was unpleasant for Bābur.
That his alliance with Ismā‘īl was dangerous he will have known,
as also that his risks grew as Transoxiana was over-spread by
news of Ismā‘īl’s fanatical barbarism to pious and learned Sunnīs,
notably in Herī. He manifested desire for release both now
and later,&mdash;now when he not only dismissed his Persian helpers
but so behaved to the Shāh’s envoy Muḥammad Jān,&mdash;he was
Najm S̤ānī’s Lord of the Gate,&mdash;that the envoy felt neglect and
made report of Bābur as arrogant, in opposition, and unwilling
to fulfil his compact,&mdash;later when he eagerly attempted success
unaided against ‘Ubaid Khān, and was then worsted. It illustrates
the Shāh’s view of his suzerain relation to Bābur that on hearing
Muḥammad Jān’s report, he ordered Najm S&#804;ānī to bring the
offender to order.</p>

<p>Meantime the Shāh’s conditions seem to have been carried
out in Samarkand and Bābur’s subservience clearly shewn.<a name="FNanchor_1337" id="FNanchor_1337"></a><a href="#Footnote_1337" class="fnanchor">1337</a> Of
this there are the indications,&mdash;that Bābur had promised and
was a man of his word; that Sunnī irritation against him waxed
and did not wane as it might have done without food to nourish
it; that Bābur knew himself impotent against the Aūzbegs
unless he had foreign aid, expected attack, knew it was preparing;
that he would hear of Muḥammad Jān’s report and of Najm
S̤ānī’s commission against himself. Honesty, policy and necessity
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>combined to enforce the fulfilment of his agreement. What
were the precise terms of that agreement beyond the two as to
the <i>khut̤ba</i> and the coins, it needs close study of the wording
of the sources to decide, lest metaphor be taken for fact. Great
passions,&mdash;ambition, religious fervour, sectarian bigotry and fear
confronted him. His problem was greater than that of Henry
of Navarre and of Napoleon in Egypt; they had but to seem
what secured their acceptance; he had to put on a guise that
brought him hate.</p>

<p>Khān-zāda was not the only member of Bābur’s family who
now rejoined him after marriage with an Aūzbeg. His half-sister
Yādgār-sult̤ān had fallen to the share of Ḥamza Sult̤ān’s
son ‘Abdu’l-lat̤īf in 908 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> when Shaibānī defeated the Khāns
near Akhsī. Now that her half-brother had defeated her
husband’s family, she returned to her own people (f. 9).</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">918 AH.-MARCH 19th 1512 to MARCH 9th 1513 AD.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><i>a. Return of the Aūzbegs.</i></p>

<p>Emboldened by the departure of the Persian troops, the
Aūzbegs, in the spring of the year, came out of Turkistān, their
main attack being directed on Tāshkīnt, then held for Bābur.<a name="FNanchor_1338" id="FNanchor_1338"></a><a href="#Footnote_1338" class="fnanchor">1338</a>
‘Ubaid Khān moved for Bukhārā. He had prefaced his march
by vowing that, if successful, he would thenceforth strictly
observe Musalmān Law. The vow was made in Ḥaẓrat Turkistān
at the shrine of Khwāja Aḥmad <i>Yasawī</i>, a saint revered in
Central Asia through many centuries; he had died about
1120 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>; Tīmūr had made pilgrimage to his tomb, in 1397 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>,
and then had founded the mosque still dominating the town,
still the pilgrim’s land-mark.<a name="FNanchor_1339" id="FNanchor_1339"></a><a href="#Footnote_1339" class="fnanchor">1339</a> ‘Ubaid’s vow, like Bābur’s of
933 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>, was one of return to obedience. Both men took oath in
the Ghāzī’s mood, Bābur’s set against the Hindū whom he saw
as a heathen, ‘Ubaid’s set against Bābur whom he saw as a heretic.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent"><i>b. Bābur’s defeat at Kul-i-malik.</i></p>

<p>In Ṣafar (April-May) ‘Ubaid moved swiftly down and attacked
the Bukhārā neighbourhood. Bābur went from Samarkand to
meet him. Several details of what followed, not given by
Ḥaidar and, in one particular, contradicting him, are given by
Khwānd-amīr. The statement in which the two historians
contradict one another is Ḥaidar’s that ‘Ubaid had 3000 men
only, Bābur 40,000. Several considerations give to Khwānd-amīr’s
opposed statement that Bābur’s force was small, the
semblance of being nearer the fact. Ḥaidar, it may be said, did
not go out on this campaign; he was ill in Samarkand and
continued ill there for some time; Khwānd-amīr’s details have
the well-informed air of things learned at first-hand, perhaps
from some-one in Hindūstān after 934 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span></p>

<p>Matters which make against Bābur’s having a large effective
force at Kul-i-malik, and favour Khwānd-amīr’s statement about
the affair are these:&mdash;‘Ubaid must have formed some estimate
of what he had to meet, and he brought 3000 men. Where
could Bābur have obtained 40,000 men worth reckoning in
a fight? In several times of crisis his own immediate and ever-faithful
troop is put at 500; as his cause was now unpopular,
local accretions may have been few. Some Mughūls from Merv
and from Kābul were near Samarkand (T.R. pp. 263, 265);
most were with Sa‘īd in Andijān; but however many Mughūls
may have been in his neighbourhood, none could be counted on
as resolute for his success. If too, he had had more than a
small effective force, would he not have tried to hold Samarkand
with the remnant of defeat until Persian help arrived? All
things considered, there is ground for accepting Khwānd-amīr’s
statement that Bābur met ‘Ubaid with a small force.</p>

<p>Following his account therefore:&mdash;Bābur in his excess of
daring, marched to put the Aūzbeg down with a small force
only, against the advice of the prudent, of whom Muḥammad
Mazīd Tarkhān was one, who all said it was wrong to go out
unprepared and without reinforcement. Paying them no attention,
Bābur marched for Bukhārā, was rendered still more daring
by news had when he neared it, that the enemy had retired
some stages, and followed him up almost to his camp. ‘Ubaid was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
in great force; many Aūzbegs perished but, in the end, they
were victors and Bābur was compelled to take refuge in Bukhārā.
The encounter took place near Kul-i-malik (King’s-lake) in
Ṣafar 918 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (April-May 1512 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>).</p>

<p class="indent"><i>c. Bābur leaves Samarkand.</i></p>

<p>It was not possible to maintain a footing in Samarkand;
Bābur therefore collected his family and train<a name="FNanchor_1340" id="FNanchor_1340"></a><a href="#Footnote_1340" class="fnanchor">1340</a> and betook himself
to Ḥiṣār. There went with him on this expedition Māhīm
and her children Humāyūn, Mihr-jahān and Bārbūl,&mdash;the
motherless Ma‘ṣūma,&mdash;Gul-rukh with her son Kāmrān (Gulbadan
f. 7). I have not found any account of his route; Ḥaidar
gives no details about the journey; he did not travel with
Bābur, being still invalided in Samarkand. Perhaps the absence
of information is a sign that the Aūzbegs had not yet appeared
on the direct road for Ḥiṣār. A local tradition however would
make Bābur go round through Farghāna. He certainly might
have gone into Farghāna hoping to co-operate with Sa‘īd Khān;
Tāshkīnt was still holding out under Aḥmad-i-qāsim <i>Kohbur</i>
and it is clear that all activity in Bābur’s force had not been
quenched because during the Tāshkīnt siege, Dost Beg broke
through the enemy’s ranks and made his way into the town.
Sairām held out longer than Tāshkīnt. Of any such move by
Bābur into Andijān the only hint received is given by what may
be a mere legend.<a name="FNanchor_1341" id="FNanchor_1341"></a><a href="#Footnote_1341" class="fnanchor">1341</a></p>

<p class="indent"><i>d. Bābur in Ḥiṣār.</i></p>

<p>After experiencing such gains and such losses, Bābur was
still under 30 years of age.</p>

<p>The Aūzbegs, after his departure, re-occupied Bukhārā and
Samarkand without harm done to the towns-people, and a few
weeks later, in Jumāda I (July-August) followed him to Ḥiṣār.
Meantime he with Mīrzā Khān’s help, had so closed the streets
of the town by massive earth-works that the sult̤āns were convinced
its defenders were ready to spend the last drop of their
blood in holding it, and therefore retired without attack.<a name="FNanchor_1342" id="FNanchor_1342"></a><a href="#Footnote_1342" class="fnanchor">1342</a> Some
sources give as their reason for retirement that Bābur had been
reinforced from Balkh; Bairām Beg, it is true, had sent a force
but one of 300 men only; so few cannot have alarmed except
as the harbinger of more. Greater precision as to dates would
shew whether they can have heard of Najm S̤ānī’s army
advancing by way of Balkh.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>e. Qarshī and Ghaj-davān.</i></p>

<p>Meantime Najm S̤ānī, having with him some 11,000 men,
had started on his corrective mission against Bābur. When he
reached the Khurāsān frontier, he heard of the defeat at Kul-i-malik
and the flight to Ḥiṣār, gathered other troops from Harāt
and elsewhere, and advanced to Balkh. He stayed there for
20 days with Bairām Beg, perhaps occupied, in part, by communications
with the Shāh and Bābur. From the latter repeated
request for help is said to have come; help was given, some
sources say without the Shāh’s permission. A rendezvous was
fixed, Najm S̤ānī marched to Tīrmīẕ, there crossed the Amū
and in Rajab (Sep.-Oct.) encamped near the Darband-i-ahanīn.
On Bābur’s approach through the Chak-chaq pass, he paid him
the civility of going several miles out from his camp to give him
honouring reception.</p>

<p>Advancing thence for Bukhārā, the combined armies took
Khuzār and moved on to Qarshī. This town Bābur wished to
pass by, as it had been passed by on his previous march for
Bukhārā; each time perhaps he wished to spare its people,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>formerly his subjects, whom he desired to rule again, and who
are reputed to have been mostly his fellow Turks. Najm S̤ānī
refused to pass on; he said Qarshī must be taken because it
was ‘Ubaidu’l-lāh Khān’s nest; in it was ‘Ubaid’s uncle Shaikhīm
Mīrzā; it was captured; the Aūzbeg garrison was put to the
sword and, spite of Bābur’s earnest entreaties, all the towns-people,
15,000 persons it is said, down to the “suckling and
decrepit”, were massacred. Amongst the victims was Banā’ī
who happened to be within it. This action roused the utmost
anger against Najm S̤ānī; it disgusted Bābur, not only through
its merciless slaughter but because it made clear the disregard
in which he was held by his magnificent fellow-general.</p>

<p>From murdered Qarshī Najm S̤ānī advanced for Bukhārā.
On getting within a few miles of it, he heard that an Aūzbeg
force was approaching under Tīmūr and Abū-sa‘īd, presumably
from Samarkand therefore. He sent Bairām Beg to attack them;
they drew off to the north and threw themselves into Ghaj-davān,
the combined armies following them. This move placed Najm
S̤ānī across the Zar-afshān, on the border of the desert with
which the Aūzbegs were familiar, and with ‘Ubaid on his flank
in Bukhārā.</p>

<p>As to what followed the sources vary; they are brief; they
differ less in statement of the same occurrence than in their
choice of details to record; as Mr. Erskine observes their varying
stories are not incompatible. Their widest difference is a statement
of time but the two periods named, one a few days, the
other four months, may not be meant to apply to the same
event. Four months the siege is said to have lasted; this could
not have been said if it had been a few days only. The siege
seems to have been of some duration.</p>

<p>At first there were minor engagements, ending with varying
success; provisions and provender became scarce; Najm S̤ānī’s
officers urged retirement, so too did Bābur. He would listen to
none of them. At length ‘Ubaid Khān rode out from Bukhārā
at the head of excellent troops; he joined the Ghaj-davān
garrison and the united Aūzbegs posted themselves in the
suburbs where walled lanes and gardens narrowed the field and
lessened Najm S̤ānī’s advantage in numbers. On Tuesday<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
Ramẓān 3rd (Nov. 12th)<a name="FNanchor_1343" id="FNanchor_1343"></a><a href="#Footnote_1343" class="fnanchor">1343</a> a battle was fought in which his army
was routed and he himself slain.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>f. Bābur and Yār-i-aḥmad Najm Sānī.</i></p>

<p>Some writers say that Najm S̤ānī’s men did not fight well;
it must be remembered that they may have been weakened by
privation and that they had wished to retire. Of Bābur it is
said that he, who was the reserve, did not fight at all; it is
difficult to see good cause why, under all the circumstances, he
should risk the loss of his men. It seems likely that Ḥaidar’s
strong language about this defeat would suit Bābur’s temper
also. “The victorious breezes of Islām overturned the banners
of the schismatics.... Most of them perished on the field;
the rents made by the sword at Qarshī were sewn up at Ghaj-davān
by the arrow-stitches of vengeance. Najm S̤ānī and all
the Turkmān amīrs were sent to hell.”</p>

<p>The belief that Bābur had failed Najm S̤ānī persisted at the
Persian Court, for his inaction was made a reproach to his son
Humāyūn in 951 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (1544 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>), when Humāyūn was a refugee
with Ismā‘īl’s son T̤ahmāsp. Badāyūnī tells a story which, with
great inaccuracy of name and place, represents the view taken
at that time. The part of the anecdote pertinent here is that
Bābur on the eve of the battle at Ghaj-davān, shot an arrow
into the Aūzbeg camp which carried the following couplet,
expressive of his ill-will to the Shāh and perhaps also of his
rejection of the Shī‘a guise he himself had worn.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>g. The Mughūls attack Bābur.</i></p>

<p>On his second return to Ḥiṣār Bābur was subjected to great
danger by a sudden attack made upon him by the Mughūls where
he lay at night in his camp outside the town. Firishta says, but
without particulars of their offence, that Bābur had reproached
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>them for their misconduct; the absence of detail connecting the
affair with the defeat just sustained, leads to the supposition
that their misdeeds were a part of the tyranny over the country-people
punished later by ‘Ubaidu’l-lāh Khān. Roused from his
sleep by the noise of his guards’ resistance to the Mughūl attack,
Bābur escaped with difficulty and without a single attendant<a name="FNanchor_1345" id="FNanchor_1345"></a><a href="#Footnote_1345" class="fnanchor">1345</a>
into the fort. The conspirators plundered his camp and withdrew
to Qarā-tīgīn. He was in no position to oppose them, left
a few men in Ḥiṣār and went to Mīrzā Khān in Qūndūz.</p>

<p>After he left, Ḥiṣār endured a desolating famine, a phenomenal
snowfall and the ravages of the Mughūls. ‘Ubaid Khān avenged
Bābur on the horde; hearing of their excesses, he encamped
outside the position they had taken up in Wakhsh defended by
river, hills and snow, waited till a road thawed, then fell upon
them and avenged the year’s misery they had inflicted on the
Ḥiṣārīs. Ḥaidar says of them that it was their villainy lost
Ḥiṣār to Bābur and gained it for the Aūzbeg.<a name="FNanchor_1346" id="FNanchor_1346"></a><a href="#Footnote_1346" class="fnanchor">1346</a></p>

<p>These Mughūls had for chiefs men who when Sa‘īd went to
Andijān, elected to stay with Bābur. One of the three named
by Ḥaidar was Ayūb <i>Begchīk</i>. He repented his disloyalty;
when he lay dying some two years later (920 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>) in Yāngī-ḥiṣār,
he told Sa‘īd Khān who visited him, that what was
“lacerating his bowels and killing him with remorse”, was his
faithlessness to Bābur in Ḥiṣār, the oath he had broken at the
instigation of those “hogs and bears”, the Mughūl chiefs
(T.R. p. 315).</p>

<p>In this year but before the Mughūl treachery to Bābur, Ḥaidar
left him, starting in Rajab (Sep.-Oct.) to Sa‘id in Andijān and
thus making a beginning of his 19 years spell of service.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">919 AH.-MARCH 9th 1513 to FEB. 26th 1514 AD.</span></p>

<p>Bābur may have spent this year in Khishm (Ḥ.S. iii, 372).
During two or three months of it, he had one of the Shāh’s
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>retainers in his service, Khwāja Kamālu’d-dīn Maḥmūd, who
had fled from Ghaj-davān to Balkh, heard there that the Balkhīs
favoured an Aūzbeg chief whose coming was announced, and
therefore went to Bābur. In Jumāda 11 (August), hearing that
the Aūzbeg sultan had left Balkh, he returned there but was
not admitted because the Balkhīs feared reprisals for their
welcome to the Aūzbeg, a fear which may indicate that he had
taken some considerable reinforcement to Bābur. He went on
into Khurāsān and was there killed; Balkh was recaptured for
the Shāh by Deo Sult̤ān, a removal from Aūzbeg possession
which helps to explain how Bābur came to be there in 923 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">920 AH.&mdash;FEB. 26th 1514 to FEB. 15th 1515 AD.</span></p>

<p>Ḥaidar writes of Bābur as though he were in Qūndūz this
year (TR. p. 263), says that he suffered the greatest misery and
want, bore it with his accustomed courtesy and patience but, at
last, despairing of success in recovering Ḥiṣār, went back to
Kābul. Now it seems to be that he made the stay in Khwāst to
which he refers later (f. 241<i>b</i>) and during which his daughter
Gul-rang was born, as Gul-badan’s chronicle allows known.</p>

<p>It was at the end of the year, after the privation of winter
therefore, that he reached Kābul. When he re-occupied Samarkand
in 917 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>, he had given Kābul to his half-brother Nāṣir
Mīrzā; the Mīrzā received him now with warm welcome and
protestations of devotion and respect, spoke of having guarded
Kābul for him and asked permission to return to his own old fief
Ghaznī. His behaviour made a deep impression on Bābur; it
would be felt as a humane touch on the sore of failure.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">921 AH.&mdash;FEB. 15th 1515 to FEB. 5th 1516 AD.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><i>a. Rebellion of chiefs in Ghaznī.</i></p>

<p>Nāṣir Mīrzā died shortly after (<i>dar hamān ayyām</i>) his return
to Ghaznī. Disputes then arose amongst the various commanders
who were in Ghaznī; Sherīm T̤aghāī was one of them
and the main strength of the tumult was given by the Mughūls.
Many others were however involved in it, even such an old
servant as Bābā of Pashāghar taking part (f. 234<i>b</i>; T.R. p. 356).
Ḥaidar did not know precisely the cause of the dispute, or shew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
why it should have turned against Bābur, since he attributes
it to possession taken by Satan of the brains of the chiefs and
a consequent access of vain-glory and wickedness. Possibly
some question of succession to Nāṣir arose. Dost Beg distinguished
himself in the regular battle which ensued; Qāsim
Beg’s son Qaṃbar-i-‘alī hurried down from Qūndūz and also did
his good part to win it for Bābur. Many of the rioters were
killed, others fled to Kāshghar. Sherīm T̤aghāī was one of the
latter; as Sa‘īd Khān gave him no welcome, he could not stay
there; he fell back on the much injured Bābur who, says
Ḥaidar, showed him his usual benevolence, turned his eyes from
his offences and looked only at his past services until he died
shortly afterwards (T.R. p. 357).<a name="FNanchor_1347" id="FNanchor_1347"></a><a href="#Footnote_1347" class="fnanchor">1347</a></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">922 AH.&mdash;FEB. 5th 1516 to JAN. 24th 1517 AD.</span></p>

<p>This year may have been spent in and near Kābul in the
quiet promoted by the dispersion of the Mughūls.</p>

<p>In this year was born Bābur’s son Muḥammad known as
<i>‘Askarī</i> from his being born in camp. He was the son of
Gulrukh <i>Begchīk</i> and full-brother of Kāmrān.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">923 AH.&mdash;JAN. 24th 1517 to JAN. 13th 1518 AD.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><i>a. Bābur visits Balkh.</i></p>

<p>Khwānd-amīr is the authority for the little that is known of
Bābur’s action in this year (Ḥ.S. iii, 367 <i>et seq.</i>). It is connected
with the doings of Badī‘u’z-zamān <i>Bāī-qarā’s</i> son Muḥammad-i-zamān.
This Mīrzā had had great wanderings, during a part
of which Khwānd-amīr was with him. In 920 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> he was in
Shāh Ismā‘īl’s service and in Balkh, but was not able to keep it.
Bābur invited him to Kābul,&mdash;the date of invitation will have
been later therefore than Bābur’s return there at the end of
920 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> The Mīrzā was on his way but was dissuaded from
going into Kābul by Mahdī Khwāja and went instead into
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
Ghurjistān. Bābur was angered by his non-arrival and pursued
him in order to punish him but did not succeed in reaching
Ghurjistān and went back to Kābul by way of Fīrūz-koh and
Ghūr. The Mīrzā was captured eventually and sent to Kābul.
Bābur treated him with kindness, after a few months gave him
his daughter Ma‘ṣūma in marriage, and sent him to Balkh. He
appears to have been still in Balkh when Khwānd-amīr was
writing of the above occurrences in 929 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> The marriage took
place either at the end of 923 or beginning of 924 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> The
Mīrzā was then 21, Ma‘ṣūma 9; she almost certainly did not then
go to Balkh. At some time in 923 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> Bābur is said by Khwānd-amīr
to have visited that town.<a name="FNanchor_1348" id="FNanchor_1348"></a><a href="#Footnote_1348" class="fnanchor">1348</a></p>

<p class="indent"><i>b. Attempt on Qandahār.</i></p>

<p>In this year Bābur marched for Qandahār but the move
ended peacefully, because a way was opened for gifts and terms
by an illness which befell him when he was near the town.</p>

<p>The <i>Tārīkh-i-sind</i> gives what purports to be Shāh Beg’s
explanation of Bābur’s repeated attempts on Qandahār. He
said these had been made and would be made because Bābur
had not forgiven Muqīm for taking Kābul 14 years earlier from
the Tīmūrid ‘Abdu’r-razzāq; that this had brought him to
Qandahār in 913 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>, this had made him then take away Māhchuchak,
Muqīm’s daughter; that there were now (923 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>)
many unemployed Mīrzās in Kābul for whom posts could not
be found in regions where the Persians and Aūzbegs were
dominant; that an outlet for their ambitions and for Bābur’s
own would be sought against the weaker opponent he himself was.</p>

<p>Bābur’s decision to attack in this year is said to have been
taken while Shāh Beg was still a prisoner of Shāh Ismā‘īl in the
Harāt country; he must have been released meantime by the
admirable patience of his slave Saṃbhal.</p>

<hr />

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">924 AH.&mdash;JAN. 13th 1518 to JAN. 3rd 1519 AD.</span></p>

<p>In this year Shāh Beg’s son Shāh Ḥasan came to Bābur after
quarrel with his father. He stayed some two years, and during
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>that time was married to Khalīfa’s daughter Gul-barg (Rose-leaf).
His return to Qandahār will have taken place shortly
before Bābur’s campaign of 926 <span class="smcap">A.H.</span> against it, a renewed effort
which resulted in possession on Shawwāl 13th 928 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (Sep. 6th

<p class="indent">(<i>a. Bābur takes the fort of Bajaur.</i>)</p>

<p>(<i>Jan. 3rd</i>) On Monday<a name="FNanchor_1352" id="FNanchor_1352"></a><a href="#Footnote_1352" class="fnanchor">1352</a> the first day of the month of

astronomical hour.</p>

<p>(<i>Jan. 4th</i>) Marching at dawn from that camp with the
intention of attacking the fort of Bajaur,<a name="FNanchor_1354" id="FNanchor_1354"></a><a href="#Footnote_1354" class="fnanchor">1354</a> we dismounted near
it and sent a trusty man of the Dilazāk<a name="FNanchor_1355" id="FNanchor_1355"></a><a href="#Footnote_1355" class="fnanchor">1355</a> Afghāns to advise its

surrender the fort. Not accepting this counsel, that stupid and
ill-fated band sent back a wild answer, where-upon the army
was ordered to make ready mantelets, ladders and other
appliances for taking a fort. For this purpose a day’s (<i>Jan. 5th</i>)
halt was made on that same ground.</p>

<p>(<i>Jan. 6th</i>) On Thursday the 4th of Muḥarram, orders were
given that the army should put on mail, arm and get to horse;<a name="FNanchor_1357" id="FNanchor_1357"></a><a href="#Footnote_1357" class="fnanchor">1357</a>
that the left wing should move swiftly to the upper side of the
fort, cross the water at the water-entry,<a name="FNanchor_1358" id="FNanchor_1358"></a><a href="#Footnote_1358" class="fnanchor">1358</a> and dismount on the
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;217.</span>north side of the fort; that the centre, not taking the way
across the water, should dismount in the rough, up-and-down
land to the north-west of the fort; and that the right should
dismount to the west of the lower gate. While the begs of the
left under Dost Beg were dismounting, after crossing the water,
a hundred to a hundred and fifty men on foot came out of the
fort, shooting arrows. The begs, shooting in their turn,
advanced till they had forced those men back to the foot of the
ramparts, Mullā ‘Abdu’l-malūk of Khwāst, like a madman,<a name="FNanchor_1359" id="FNanchor_1359"></a><a href="#Footnote_1359" class="fnanchor">1359</a> going
up right under them on his horse. There and then the fort
would have been taken if the ladders and mantelets had been
ready, and if it had not been so late in the day. Mullā Tirik-i-‘alī<a name="FNanchor_1360" id="FNanchor_1360"></a><a href="#Footnote_1360" class="fnanchor">1360</a>
and a servant of Tīngrī-bīrdī crossed swords with the
enemy; each overcame his man, cut off and brought in his
head; for this each was promised a reward.</p>

<p>As the Bajaurīs had never before seen matchlocks (<i>tufang</i>)
they at first took no care about them, indeed they made fun
when they heard the report and answered it by unseemly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>gestures. On that day<a name="FNanchor_1361" id="FNanchor_1361"></a><a href="#Footnote_1361" class="fnanchor">1361</a> Ustād ‘Alī-qulī shot at and brought
down five men with his matchlock; Walī the Treasurer, for
his part, brought down two; other matchlockmen were also
very active in firing and did well, shooting through shield,
through cuirass, through <i>kusarū</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1362" id="FNanchor_1362"></a><a href="#Footnote_1362" class="fnanchor">1362</a> and bringing down one man
after another. Perhaps 7, 8, or 10 Bajaurīs had fallen to the
matchlock-fire (<i>ẓarb</i>) before night. After that it so became
that not a head could be put out because of the fire. The order<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;217b.</span>
was given, “It is night; let the army retire, and at dawn, if the
appliances are ready, let them swarm up into the fort.”</p>

<p>(<i>Jan. 7th</i>) At the first dawn of light (<i>farẓ waqt</i>) on Friday
the 5th of Muḥarram, orders were given that, when the battle-nagarets
had sounded, the army should advance, each man from
his place to his appointed post (<i>yīrlīk yīrdīn</i>) and should swarm
up. The left and centre advanced from their ground with
mantelets in place all along their lines, fixed their ladders, and
swarmed up them. The whole left hand of the centre, under
Khalīfa, Shāh Ḥasan <i>Arghūn</i> and Yūsuf’s Aḥmad, was ordered
to reinforce the left wing. Dost Beg’s men went forward to the
foot of the north-eastern tower of the fort, and busied themselves
in undermining and bringing it down. Ustād ‘Alī-qulī was
there also; he shot very well on that day with his matchlock, and
he twice fired off the <i>firingī</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1363" id="FNanchor_1363"></a><a href="#Footnote_1363" class="fnanchor">1363</a> Walī the Treasurer also brought
down a man with his matchlock. Malik ‘Alī <i>qut̤nī</i><a name="FNanchor_1364" id="FNanchor_1364"></a><a href="#Footnote_1364" class="fnanchor">1364</a> was first
up a ladder of all the men from the left hand of the centre,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>and there was busy with fight and blow. At the post of the
centre, Muḥ. ‘Alī <i>Jang-jang</i><a name="FNanchor_1365" id="FNanchor_1365"></a><a href="#Footnote_1365" class="fnanchor">1365</a> and his younger brother Nau-roz
got up, each by a different ladder, and made lance and sword to
touch. Bābā the waiting man (<i>yasāwal</i>), getting up by another
ladder, occupied himself in breaking down the fort-wall with his
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;218.</span>axe. Most of our braves went well forward, shooting off dense
flights of arrows and not letting the enemy put out a head;
others made themselves desperately busy in breaching and
pulling down the fort, caring naught for the enemy’s fight and
blow, giving no eye to his arrows and stones. By breakfast-time
Dost Beg’s men had undermined and breached the north-eastern
tower, got in and put the foe to flight. The men of the centre
got in up the ladders by the same time, but those (<i>aūl</i>) others
were first (<i>awwal</i>?) in.<a name="FNanchor_1366" id="FNanchor_1366"></a><a href="#Footnote_1366" class="fnanchor">1366</a> By the favour and pleasure of the
High God, this strong and mighty fort was taken in two or
three astronomical hours! Matching the fort were the utter
struggle and effort of our braves; distinguish themselves they
did, and won the name and fame of heroes.</p>

<p>As the Bajaurīs were rebels and at enmity with the people
of Islām, and as, by reason of the heathenish and hostile customs
prevailing in their midst, the very name of Islām was rooted out
from their tribe, they were put to general massacre and their
wives and children were made captive. At a guess more than
3000 men went to their death; as the fight did not reach to the
eastern side of the fort, a few got away there.</p>

<p>The fort taken, we entered and inspected it. On the walls,
in houses, streets and alleys, the dead lay, in what numbers!
Comers and goers to and fro were passing over the bodies.
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;218b.</span>Returning from our inspection, we sat down in the Bajaur

<p>(<i>Jan. 8th</i>) Marching at dawn (Muḥ. 6th), we dismounted by
the spring<a name="FNanchor_1368" id="FNanchor_1368"></a><a href="#Footnote_1368" class="fnanchor">1368</a> of Bābā Qarā in the dale of Bajaur. At Khwāja
Kalān’s request the prisoners remaining were pardoned their
offences, reunited to their wives and children, and given leave to
go, but several sult̤āns and of the most stubborn were made to
reach their doom of death. Some heads of sult̤āns and of others
were sent to Kābul with the news of success; some also to
Badakhshān, Qūndūz and Balkh with the letters-of-victory.</p>

<p>Shāh Manṣūr <i>Yūsuf-zāī</i>,&mdash;he was with us as an envoy from
his tribe,&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_1369" id="FNanchor_1369"></a><a href="#Footnote_1369" class="fnanchor">1369</a> was an eye-witness of the victory and general
massacre. We allowed him to leave after putting a coat (<i>tūn</i>)
on him and after writing orders with threats to the Yūsuf-zāī.</p>

<p>(<i>Jan. 11th</i>) With mind easy about the important affairs of
the Bajaur fort, we marched, on Tuesday the 9th of Muḥarram,
one <i>kuroh</i> (2 m.) down the dale of Bajaur and ordered that a
tower of heads should be set up on the rising-ground.</p>

<p>(<i>Jan. 12th</i>) On Wednesday the 10th of Muḥarram, we rode
out to visit the Bajaur fort. There was a wine-party in Khwāja
Kalān’s house,<a name="FNanchor_1370" id="FNanchor_1370"></a><a href="#Footnote_1370" class="fnanchor">1370</a> several goat-skins of wine having been brought

<p>(<i>Jan. 13th</i>) We spent the night there and after inspecting the
towers and ramparts of the fort early in the morning (Muḥ. 11th),
I mounted and went back to camp.</p>

<p>(<i>Jan. 14th</i>) Marching at dawn (Muḥ. 12th), we dismounted on

<p>(<i>Jan. 15th</i>) Marching thence, we dismounted (Muḥ. 13th) on
the bank of the Chandāwal torrent. Here all those inscribed in
the Bajaur reinforcement, were ordered to leave.</p>

<p>(<i>Jan. 16th</i>) On Sunday the 14th of Muḥarram, a standard was
bestowed on Khwāja Kalān and leave given him for Bajaur.
A few days after I had let him go, the following little verse
having come into my head, it was written down and sent to
him:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_1372" id="FNanchor_1372"></a><a href="#Footnote_1372" class="fnanchor">1372</a></p>

<p>Corn being somewhat scarce in the army, we went into the

<p>(<i>Jan. 21st</i>) On Friday (Muḥ. 19th) we marched for Sawād,
with the intention of attacking the Yūsuf-zāī Afghāns, and
dismounted in between<a name="FNanchor_1379" id="FNanchor_1379"></a><a href="#Footnote_1379" class="fnanchor">1379</a> the water of Panj-kūra and the united
waters of Chandāwal and Bajaur. Shāh Manṣūr <i>Yūsuf-zāī</i> had
brought a few well-flavoured and quite intoxicating confections
(<i>kamālī</i>); making one of them into three, I ate one portion,
Gadāī T̤aghāī another, ‘Abdu’l-lāh the librarian another. It
produced remarkable intoxication; so much so that at the
Evening Prayer when the begs gathered for counsel, I was not
able to go out. A strange thing it was! If in these days<a name="FNanchor_1380" id="FNanchor_1380"></a><a href="#Footnote_1380" class="fnanchor">1380</a>
I ate the whole of such a confection, I doubt if it would produce
half as much intoxication.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>c. An impost laid on Kahrāj.</i>)</p>

<p>(<i>Jan. 22nd</i>) Marching from that ground, (Muḥ. 20th), we
dismounted over against Kahrāj, at the mouth of the valleys of
Kahrāj and Peshgrām.<a name="FNanchor_1381" id="FNanchor_1381"></a><a href="#Footnote_1381" class="fnanchor">1381</a> Snow fell ankle-deep while we were on

himself was sent to collect it. Never before had those rude

the grain and were brought to ruin.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>cc. Raid on Panj-kūra.</i>)</p>

<p>(<i>Jan. 25th</i>) On Tuesday the 23rd of Muḥarram an army was
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;220.</span>sent under Hindū Beg to raid Panj-kūra. Panj-kūra lies more
than half-way up the mountain;<a name="FNanchor_1382" id="FNanchor_1382"></a><a href="#Footnote_1382" class="fnanchor">1382</a> to reach its villages a person
must go for nearly a <i>kuroh</i> (2 m.) through a pass. The people
had fled and got away; our men brought a few beasts of sorts,
and masses of corn from their houses.</p>

<p>(<i>Jan. 26th</i>) Next day (Muḥ. 24th) Qūj Beg was put at the
head of a force and sent out to raid.</p>

<p>(<i>Jan. 27th</i>) On Thursday the 25th of the month, we dismounted
at the village of Māndīsh, in the trough of the Kahrāj-valley, for
the purpose of getting corn for the army.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>d. Māhīm’s adoption of Dil-dār’s unborn child.</i>)</p>

<p>While we were still on that same ground in the Māndīsh-country,
I had a platform made with stones (<i>tāsh bīla</i>) on

tents of the advance-camp. All the household and soldiers
carried the stones for it, one by one like ants.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>e. Bābur’s marriage with his Afghān wife, Bībī Mubāraka.</i>)</p>

<p>In order to conciliate the Yūsuf-zāī horde, I had asked for

<p>While we were on this ground news came that his daughter<a name="FNanchor_1386" id="FNanchor_1386"></a><a href="#Footnote_1386" class="fnanchor">1386</a>
was on her way with the Yūsuf-zāī tribute. At the Evening

Sawād) was invited and at which he was given a seat and
special dress of honour (<i>khilcat-i-khāṣa</i>).</p>

<p>(<i>Jan. 30th</i>) On Sunday the 28th, we marched from that

<p>(<i>Feb. 4th</i>) On Friday the 3rd of the month of Ṣafar, we dismounted
at the confluence of the waters of Bajaur and Panj-kūra.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>g. Expedition against the Afghān clans.</i>)</p>

<p>(<i>Feb. 8th</i>) On Tuesday the 7th of the month the begs and
the Dilazāk Afghān headmen were summoned, and, after
consultation, matters were left at this:&mdash;“The year is at its end,<a name="FNanchor_1388" id="FNanchor_1388"></a><a href="#Footnote_1388" class="fnanchor">1388</a>
only a few days of the Fish are left; the plainsmen have carried
in all their corn; if we went now into Sawād, the army would
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;221.</span>dwindle through getting no corn. The thing to do is to march
along the Aṃbahar and Pānī-mānī road, cross the Sawād-water
above Hash-nagar, and surprise the Yūsuf-zāī and Muḥammadī
Afghāns who are located in the plain over against the Yūsuf-zāī
<i>sangur</i> of Māhūrā. Another year, coming earlier in the
harvest-time, the Afghāns of this place must be our first
thought.” So the matter was left.</p>

<p>(<i>Feb. 9th</i>) Next day, Wednesday, we bestowed horses and
robes on Sl. Wais and Sl. ‘Alā’u’u-dīn of Sawād, gave them leave
to go, marched off ourselves and dismounted over against Bajaur.</p>

<p>(<i>Feb. 10th</i>) We marched next day, leaving Shāh Manṣūr’s
daughter in Bajaur-fort until the return of the army. We dismounted
after passing Khwāja Khiẓr, and from that camp leave
was given to Khwāja Kalān; and the heavy baggage, the worn-out
horses and superfluous effects of the army were started off
into Lamghān by the Kūnār road.</p>

<p>(<i>Feb. 11th</i>) Next morning Khwāja Mīr-i-mīrān was put in
charge of the camel baggage-train and started off by the
Qūrghā-tū and Darwāza road, through the Qarā-kūpa-pass.
Riding light for the raid, we ourselves crossed the Aṃbahar-pass,
and yet another great pass, and dismounted at Pānī-mālī

<p>(<i>Feb. 12th</i>) The distance between us and the Afghāns being
short, we did not make an early start. Aūghān-bīrdī came
back at breakfast-time.<a name="FNanchor_1391" id="FNanchor_1391"></a><a href="#Footnote_1391" class="fnanchor">1391</a> He had got the better of an Afghān

brought no news so sure as the heart asks (<i>kūnkūl-tīladīk</i>). Midday
come, we marched on, crossed the Sawād-water, and dismounted
nearer<a name="FNanchor_1392" id="FNanchor_1392"></a><a href="#Footnote_1392" class="fnanchor">1392</a> the Afternoon Prayer. At the Bed-time Prayer,
we remounted and rode swiftly on.</p>

<p>(<i>Feb. 13th</i>) Rustam <i>Turkmān</i> had been sent scouting; when
the Sun was spear-high he brought word that the Afghāns had
heard about us and were shifting about, one body of them
making off by the mountain-road. On this we moved the faster,
sending raiders on ahead who killed a few, cut off their heads
and brought a band of prisoners, some cattle and flocks. The
Dilazāk Afghāns also cut off and brought in a few heads.
Turning back, we dismounted near Kātlāng and from there
sent a guide to meet the baggage-train under Khwāja Mīr-i-mīrān
and bring it to join us in Maqām.<a name="FNanchor_1393" id="FNanchor_1393"></a><a href="#Footnote_1393" class="fnanchor">1393</a></p>

<p>(<i>Feb. 14th</i>) Marching on next day, we dismounted between
Kātlāng and Maqām. A man of Shāh Manṣūr’s arrived.
Khusrau Kūkūldāsh and Aḥmadī the secretary were sent with
a few more to meet the baggage-train.</p>

<p>(<i>Feb. 15th</i>) On Wednesday the 14th of the month, the
baggage-train rejoined us while we were dismounting at Maqām.</p>

<p>It will have been within the previous 30 or 40 years that
a heretic qalandar named Shahbāz perverted a body of Yūsuf-zāī
and another of Dilazāk. His tomb was on a free and
dominating height of the lower hill at the bill (<i>tūmshūq</i>) of the<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;222.</span>
Maqām mountain. Thought I, “What is there to recommend
the tomb of a heretic qalandar for a place in air so free?” and
ordered the tomb destroyed and levelled with the ground. The
place was so charming and open that we elected to sit there
some time and to eat a confection (<i>ma’jūn</i>).</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>h. Bābur crosses the Indus for the first time.</i>)</p>

<p>We had turned off from Bajaur with Bhīra in our thoughts.<a name="FNanchor_1394" id="FNanchor_1394"></a><a href="#Footnote_1394" class="fnanchor">1394</a>
Ever since we came into Kābul it had been in my mind to
move on Hindūstān, but this had not been done for a variety of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>reasons. Nothing to count had fallen into the soldiers’ hands
during the three or four months we had been leading this army.
Now that Bhīra, the borderland of Hindūstān, was so near,
I thought a something might fall into our men’s hands if,
riding light, we went suddenly into it. To this thought I clung,
but some of my well-wishers, after we had raided the Afghāns
and dismounted at Maqām, set the matter in this way before
me:&mdash;“If we are to go into Hindūstān, it should be on a proper
basis; one part of the army stayed behind in Kābul; a body of
effective braves was left behind in Bajaur; a good part of this
army has gone into Lamghān because its horses were worn-out;
and the horses of those who have come this far, are so poor that
they have not a day’s hard riding in them.” Reasonable as
these considerations were, yet, having made the start, we paid no
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;222b.</span>attention to them but set off next day for the ford through the
water of Sind.<a name="FNanchor_1395" id="FNanchor_1395"></a><a href="#Footnote_1395" class="fnanchor">1395</a> Mīr Muḥammad the raftsman and his elder
and younger brethren were sent with a few braves to examine
the Sind-river (<i>daryā</i>), above and below the ford.</p>

<p>(<i>Feb. 16th</i>) After starting off the camp for the river, I went
to hunt rhinoceros on the Sawātī side which place people call
also Karg-khāna (Rhino-home).<a name="FNanchor_1396" id="FNanchor_1396"></a><a href="#Footnote_1396" class="fnanchor">1396</a> A few were discovered but
the jungle was dense and they did not come out of it. When
one with a calf came into the open and betook itself to flight,
many arrows were shot at it and it rushed into the near jungle;
the jungle was fired but that same rhino was not had. Another
calf was killed as it lay, scorched by the fire, writhing and
palpitating. Each person took a share of the spoil. After
leaving Sawātī, we wandered about a good deal; it was the
Bed-time Prayer when we got to camp.</p>

<p>Those sent to examine the ford came back after doing it.</p>

<p>(<i>Feb. 17th</i>) Next day, Thursday the 16th,<a name="FNanchor_1397" id="FNanchor_1397"></a><a href="#Footnote_1397" class="fnanchor">1397</a> the horses and
baggage-camels crossed through the ford and the camp-bazar
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
and foot-soldiers were put over on rafts. Some Nīl-ābīs came
and saw me at the ford-head (<i>guẕar-bāshī</i>), bringing a horse
in mail and 300 <i>shāhrukhīs</i> as an offering. At the Mid-day
Prayer of this same day, when every-one had crossed the river,
we marched on; we went on until one watch of the night had
passed (<i>circa</i> 9 p.m.) when we dismounted near the water of
Kacha-kot.<a name="FNanchor_1398" id="FNanchor_1398"></a><a href="#Footnote_1398" class="fnanchor">1398</a></p>

<p>(<i>Feb. 18th</i>) Marching on next day, we crossed the Kacha-kot-water;
noon returning, went through the Sangdakī-pass
and dismounted. While Sayyid Qāsim Lord of the Gate was<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;223.</span>
in charge of the rear (<i>chāghdāwal</i>) he overcame a few Gujūrs
who had got up with the rear march, cut off and brought in 4 or
5 of their heads.</p>

<p>(<i>Feb. 19th</i>) Marching thence at dawn and crossing the Sūhān-water,
we dismounted at the Mid-day Prayer. Those behind
kept coming in till midnight; the march had been mightily
long, and, as many horses were weak and out-of-condition,
a great number were left on the road.</p>

I had not known why it was called this; I now knew. On it
dwell two tribes, descendants from one parent-source, one is
called Jūd, the other Janjūha. These two from of old have
been the rulers and lawful commanders of the peoples and
hordes (<i>aūlūs</i>) of the range and of the country between Bhīra
and Nīl-āb. Their rule is friendly and brotherly however; they
cannot take what their hearts might desire; the portion ancient
custom has fixed is given and taken, no less and no more. The
agreement is to give one <i>shāhrukhī</i><a name="FNanchor_1400" id="FNanchor_1400"></a><a href="#Footnote_1400" class="fnanchor">1400</a> for each yoke of oxen and

taking off from those Kashmīr mountains that are one with

was Asad but as Hindūstānīs sometimes drop a vowel <i>e.g.</i> they
say <i>khabr</i> for <i>khabar</i> (news), they had said Asd for Asad, and
this went on to Hast.</p>

<p>Langar Khān was sent off to Malik Hast at once when we
dismounted. He galloped off, made Malik Hast hopeful of our
favour and kindness, and at the Bed-time Prayer, returned with
him. Malik Hast brought an offering of a horse in mail and

into my hands, whether peacefully or by force. For these reasons
it being imperative to treat these hillmen well, this following

<p>(<i>Feb. 20th</i>) Marching thence next day, we dismounted at the
Mid-day Prayer amongst fields of densely-growing corn in
Kalda-kahār.</p>

<p>Kalda-kahār is some 20 miles north of Bhīra, a level land shut
in<a name="FNanchor_1405" id="FNanchor_1405"></a><a href="#Footnote_1405" class="fnanchor">1405</a> amongst the Jūd mountains. In the middle of it is a lake
some six miles round, the in-gatherings of rain from all sides.
On the north of this lake lies an excellent meadow; on the hill-skirt
to the west of it there is a spring<a name="FNanchor_1406" id="FNanchor_1406"></a><a href="#Footnote_1406" class="fnanchor">1406</a> having its source in the
heights overlooking the lake. The place being suitable I have
made a garden there, called the Bāgh-i-ṣafā,<a name="FNanchor_1407" id="FNanchor_1407"></a><a href="#Footnote_1407" class="fnanchor">1407</a> as will be told later;
it is a very charming place with good air.</p>

<p>(<i>Feb. 21st</i>) We rode from Kalda-kahār at dawn next day.
When we reached the top of the Hamtātū-pass a few local people
waited on me, bringing a humble gift. They were joined with
‘Abdu’r-raḥīm the chief-scribe (<i>shaghāwal</i>) and sent with him to
speak the Bhīra people fair and say, “The possession of this
country by a Turk has come down from of old; beware not to
bring ruin on its people by giving way to fear and anxiety; our
eye is on this land and on this people; raid and rapine shall
not be.”</p>

<p>We dismounted near the foot of the pass at breakfast-time,<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;224b.</span>
and thence sent seven or eight men ahead, under Qurbān of
Chīrkh and ‘Abdu’l-malūk of Khwāst. Of those sent one Mīr
Muḥammad (a servant ?) of Mahdī Khwāja<a name="FNanchor_1408" id="FNanchor_1408"></a><a href="#Footnote_1408" class="fnanchor">1408</a> brought in a man.
A few Afghān headmen, who had come meantime with offerings
and done obeisance, were joined with Langar Khān to go and
speak the Bhīra people fair.</p>

<p>After crossing the pass and getting out of the jungle, we arrayed
in right and left and centre, and moved forward for Bhīra. As
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>we got near it there came in, of the servants of Daulat Khān
<i>Yūsuf-khail’s</i> son ‘Alī Khān, Sīktū’s son Dīwa <i>Hindū</i>; with them
came several of the notables of Bhīra who brought a horse and
camel as an offering and did me obeisance. At the Mid-day
Prayer we dismounted on the east of Bhīra, on the bank of the
Bahat (Jehlam), in a sown-field, without hurt or harm being
allowed to touch the people of Bhīra.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>k. History of Bhīra.</i>)</p>

<p>Tīmūr Beg had gone into Hindūstān; from the time he went
out again these several countries <i>viz.</i> Bhīra, Khūsh-āb, Chīn-āb
and Chīnīūt, had been held by his descendants and the dependants
and adherents of those descendants. After the death of Sl. Mas‘ūd
Mīrzā and his son ‘Alī <i>Asghar</i> Mīrzā, the sons of Mīr ‘Alī Beg
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;225.</span><i>viz.</i> Bābā-i-kābulī, Daryā Khān and Apāq Khān, known later as
Ghāzī Khān, all of whom Sl. Mas‘ūd M. had cherished, through
their dominant position, got possession of Kābul, Zābul and the
afore-named countries and <i>parganas</i> of Hindūstān. In Sl. Abū-sa‘īd
Mīrzā’s time, Kābul and Zābul went from their hands, the
Hindūstān countries remaining. In 910 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (1504 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>) the year
I first came into Kābul, the government of Bhīra, Khūsh-āb and
Chīn-āb depended on Sayyid ‘Alī Khān, son of Ghāzī Khān and
grandson of Mīr ‘Alī Beg, who read the <i>khut̤ba</i> for Sikandar son
of Buhlūl (<i>Lūdī Afghān</i>) and was subject to him. When I led
that army out (910 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>) Sayyid ‘Alī Khān left Bhīra in terror,
crossed the Bahat-water, and seated himself in Sher-kot, one of
the villages of Bhīra. A few years later the Afghāns became
suspicious about him on my account; he, giving way to his own
fears and anxieties, made these countries over to the then governor
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;225b.</span>in Lāhūr, Daulat Khān, son of Tātār Khān <i>Yūsuf-khail</i>, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
gave them to his own eldest son ‘Alī Khān, and in ‘Alī Khān’s
possession they now were.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(<i>Author’s note on Sl. Mas‘ūd Mīrzā.</i>) He was the son of Sūyūrghatmīsh
Mīrzā, son of Shāhrukh Mīrzā, (son of Tīmūr), and was known as Sl. Mas‘ūd
<i>Kābulī</i> because the government and administration of Kābul and Zābul were
then dependent on him (deposed 843 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1440 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>)</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(<i>Author’s note to 910 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span></i>) That year, with the wish to enter Hindūstān,
Khaibar had been crossed and Parashāwūr (<i>sic</i>) had been reached, when Bāqī
<i>Chaghānīānī</i> insisted on a move against Lower Bangash <i>i.e.</i> Kohāt, a mass
of Afghāns were raided and scraped clean (<i>qīrīb</i>), the Bannū plain was raided
and plundered, and return was made through Dūkī (Dūgī).</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(<i>Author’s note on Daulat Khān Yūsuf-khail.</i>) This Tātār Khān, the father
of Daulat Khān, was one of six or seven <i>sardārs</i> who, sallying out and
becoming dominant in Hindūstān, made Buhlūl Pādshāh. He held the
country north of the Satluj (<i>sic</i>) and Sahrind,<a name="FNanchor_1409" id="FNanchor_1409"></a><a href="#Footnote_1409" class="fnanchor">1409</a> the revenues of which exceeded

those countries from Tātār Khān’s sons and gave Lāhūr only to Daulat Khān.
That happened a year or two before I came into the country of Kābul (910 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>).</p></div>

<p>(<i>Feb. 22nd</i>) Next morning foragers were sent to several
convenient places; on the same day I visited Bhīra; and on the
same day Sangur Khān <i>Janjūha</i> came, made offering of a horse,
and did me obeisance.</p>

<p>(<i>Feb. 23rd</i>) On Wednesday the 22nd of the month, the
headmen and <i>chauderis</i><a name="FNanchor_1411" id="FNanchor_1411"></a><a href="#Footnote_1411" class="fnanchor">1411</a> of Bhīra were summoned, a sum of

and collectors were appointed. We also made an
excursion, going in a boat and there eating a confection.</p>

<p>(<i>Feb. 24th</i>) Ḥaidar the standard-bearer had been sent to the
Bilūchīs located in Bhīra and Khūsh-āb; on Thursday morning
they made an offering of an almond-coloured <i>tīpūchāq</i> [horse],
and did obeisance. As it was represented to me that some of
the soldiery were behaving without sense and were laying-hands
on Bhīra people, persons were sent who caused some of those<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;226.</span>
senseless people to meet their death-doom, of others slit the
noses and so led them round the camp.</p>

<p>(<i>Feb. 25th</i>) On Friday came a dutiful letter from the Khūshābīs;
on this Shāh Shujā‘ <i>Arghūn’s</i> son Shāh Ḥasan was
appointed to go to Khūsh-āb.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span></p>

was started for Khūsh-āb.</p>

<p>(<i>Feb. 27th</i>) On Sunday so much rain fell<a name="FNanchor_1414" id="FNanchor_1414"></a><a href="#Footnote_1414" class="fnanchor">1414</a> that water covered
all the plain. A small brackish stream<a name="FNanchor_1415" id="FNanchor_1415"></a><a href="#Footnote_1415" class="fnanchor">1415</a> flowing between Bhīra
and the gardens in which the army lay, had become like a great
river before the Mid-day Prayer; while at the ford near Bhīra
there was no footing for more than an arrow’s flight; people
crossing had to swim. In the afternoon I rode out to watch the
water coming down (<i>kīrkān sū</i>); the rain and storm were such
that on the way back there was some fear about getting in to
camp. I crossed that same water (<i>kīrkān sū</i>) with my horse
swimming. The army-people were much alarmed; most of them
abandoned tents and heavy baggage, shouldered armour, horse-mail
and arms, made their horses swim and crossed bareback.
Most streams flooded the plain.</p>

<p>(<i>Feb. 28th</i>) Next day boats were brought from the river
(Jehlam), and in these most of the army brought their tents and
baggage over. Towards mid-day, Qūj Beg’s men went 2 miles
up the water and there found a ford by which the rest crossed.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;226b.</span>(<i>March 1st</i>) After a night spent in Bhīra-fort, Jahān-nūma
they call it, we marched early on the Tuesday morning out of
the worry of the rain-flood to the higher ground north of Bhīra.</p>

<p>As there was some delay about the moneys asked for and
agreed to (<i>taqabbul</i>), the country was divided into four districts
and the begs were ordered to try to make an end of the matter.
Khalīfa was appointed to one district, Qūj Beg to another,
Nāṣir’s Dost to another, Sayyid Qāsim and Muḥibb-i-‘alī to
another. Picturing as our own the countries once occupied by
the Turk, there was to be no over-running or plundering.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>m. Envoys sent to the court in Dihlī.</i>)</p>

<p>(<i>March 3rd</i>) People were always saying, “It could do no harm
to send an envoy, for peace’ sake, to countries that once depended
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>on the Turk.” Accordingly on Thursday the 1st of Rabī‘u’l-awwal,
Mullā Murshid was appointed to go to Sl. Ibrāhīm who
through the death of his father Sl. Iskandar had attained to rule
in Hindūstān some 5 or 6 months earlier(?). I sent him a goshawk
(<i>qārchīgha</i>) and asked for the countries which from of old had
depended on the Turk. Mullā Murshid was given charge of
writings (<i>khāt̤t̤lār</i>) for Daulat Khān (<i>Yūsuf-khail</i>) and writings
for Sl. Ibrāhīm; matters were sent also by word-of-mouth; and
he was given leave to go. Far from sense and wisdom, shut off
from judgment and counsel must people in Hindūstān be, the
Afghāns above all; for they could not move and make stand
like a foe, nor did they know ways and rules of friendliness.<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;227.</span>
Daulat Khān kept my man several days in Lāhūr without seeing
him himself or speeding him on to Sl. Ibrāhīm; and he came
back to Kābul a few months later without bringing a reply.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>n. Birth of Hind-āl.</i>)</p>

<p>(<i>March 4th</i>) On Friday the 2nd of the month, the foot-soldiers
Shaibak and Darwesh-i-‘alī,&mdash;he is now a matchlockman,&mdash;bringing
dutiful letters from Kābul, brought news also of
Hind-āl’s birth. As the news came during the expedition into
Hindūstān, I took it as an omen, and gave the name Hind-āl
(Taking of Hind). Dutiful letters came also from Muḥammad-i-zamān
M. in Balkh, by the hand of Qaṃbar Beg.</p>

<p>(<i>March 5th</i>) Next morning when the Court rose, we rode out
for an excursion, entered a boat and there drank <i>‘araq</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1416" id="FNanchor_1416"></a><a href="#Footnote_1416" class="fnanchor">1416</a> The
people of the party were Khwāja Dost-khāwand, Khusrau, Mīrīm,
Mīrzā Qulī, Muḥammadī, Aḥmadī, Gadāī, Na‘man, Langar Khān,
Rauh-dam,<a name="FNanchor_1417" id="FNanchor_1417"></a><a href="#Footnote_1417" class="fnanchor">1417</a> Qāsim-i-‘alī the opium-eater (<i>tariyākī</i>), Yūsuf-i-‘alī
and Tīngrī-qulī. Towards the head of the boat there was a <i>tālār</i><a name="FNanchor_1418" id="FNanchor_1418"></a><a href="#Footnote_1418" class="fnanchor">1418</a>
on the flat top of which I sat with a few people, a few others
sitting below. There was a sitting-place also at the tail of the
boat; there Muḥammadī, Gadāī and Na‘man sat. <i>‘Araq</i> was
drunk till the Other Prayer when, disgusted by its bad flavour,
by consent of those at the head of the boat, <i>ma’jūn</i> was preferred.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span><span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;227b.</span>Those at the other end, knowing nothing about our <i>ma’jūn</i> drank
<i>‘araq</i> right through. At the Bed-time Prayer we rode from the
boat and got into camp late. Thinking I had been drinking
<i>‘araq</i> Muḥammadī and Gadāī had said to one another, “Let’s do
befitting service,” lifted a pitcher of <i>‘araq</i> up to one another in
turn on their horses, and came in saying with wonderful joviality
and heartiness and speaking together, “Through this dark night
have we come carrying this pitcher in turns!” Later on when
they knew that the party was (now) meant to be otherwise and the
hilarity to differ, that is to say, that [there would be that] of the
<i>ma’jūn</i> band and that of the drinkers, they were much disturbed
because never does a <i>ma’jūn</i> party go well with a drinking-party.
Said I, “Don’t upset the party! Let those who wish to drink
<i>‘araq</i>, drink <i>‘araq</i>; let those who wish to eat <i>ma’jūn</i>, eat <i>ma’jūn</i>.
Let no-one on either side make talk or allusion to the other.”
Some drank <i>‘araq</i>, some ate <i>ma’jūn</i>, and for a time the party
went on quite politely. Bābā Jān the <i>qabūz</i>-player had not been
of our party (in the boat); we invited him when we reached the
tents. He asked to drink <i>‘araq</i>. We invited Tardī Muḥammad
<i>Qībchāq</i> also and made him a comrade of the drinkers. A <i>ma’jūn</i>
party never goes well with an <i>‘araq</i> or a wine-party; the drinkers
began to make wild talk and chatter from all sides, mostly in
allusion to <i>ma’jūn</i> and <i>ma’jūnīs</i>. Bābā Jān even, when drunk, said
many wild things. The drinkers soon made Tardī Khān mad-drunk,
by giving him one full bowl after another. Try as we did
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;228.</span>to keep things straight, nothing went well; there was much disgusting
uproar; the party became intolerable and was broken up.</p>

<p>(<i>March 7th</i>) On Monday the 5th of the month, the country
of Bhīra was given to Hindū Beg.</p>

<p>(<i>March 8th</i>) On Tuesday the Chīn-āb country was bestowed
on Ḥusain <i>Aīkrak</i>(?) and leave was given to him and the Chīn-āb
people to set out. At this time Sayyid ‘Alī Khān’s son Minūchihr
Khān, having let us know (his intention), came and waited on me.
He had started from Hindūstān by the upper road, had met in
with Tātār Khān <i>Kakar</i>;<a name="FNanchor_1419" id="FNanchor_1419"></a><a href="#Footnote_1419" class="fnanchor">1419</a> Tātār Khān had not let him pass on,
but had kept him, made him a son-in-law by giving him his own
daughter, and had detained him for some time.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>o. The Kakars.</i>)</p>

<p>In amongst the mountains of Nīl-āb and Bhīra which connect
with those of Kashmīr, there are, besides the Jūd and Janjūha
tribes, many Jats, Gujūrs, and others akin to them, seated in
villages everywhere on every rising-ground. These are governed
by headmen of the Kakar tribes, a headship like that over the
Jūd and Janjūha. At this time (925 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>) the headmen of the
people of those hill-skirts were Tātār <i>Kakar</i> and Hātī <i>Kakar</i>,
two descendants of one forefather; being paternal-uncles’ sons.<a name="FNanchor_1420" id="FNanchor_1420"></a><a href="#Footnote_1420" class="fnanchor">1420</a>
Torrent-beds and ravines are their strongholds. Tātār’s place,
named Parhāla,<a name="FNanchor_1421" id="FNanchor_1421"></a><a href="#Footnote_1421" class="fnanchor">1421</a> is a good deal below the snow-mountains;
Hātī’s country connects with the mountains and also he had
made Bābū Khān’s fief Kālanjar,<a name="FNanchor_1422" id="FNanchor_1422"></a><a href="#Footnote_1422" class="fnanchor">1422</a> look towards himself. Tātār<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;228b.</span>
<i>Kakar</i> had seen Daulat Khān (<i>Yūsuf-khail</i>) and looked to him
with complete obedience. Hātī had not seen Daulat Khān; his
attitude towards him was bad and turbulent. At the word of
the Hindūstān begs and in agreement with them, Tātār had so
posted himself as to blockade Hātī from a distance. Just when
we were in Bhīra, Hātī moved on pretext of hunting, fell unexpectedly
on Tātār, killed him, and took his country, his wives
and his having (<i>būlghāni</i>).<a name="FNanchor_1423" id="FNanchor_1423"></a><a href="#Footnote_1423" class="fnanchor">1423</a></p>

<p class="indent">(<i>p. Bābur’s journey resumed.</i>)</p>

<p>Having ridden out at the Mid-day Prayer for an excursion,
we got on a boat and <i>‘araq</i> was drunk. The people of the party

<i>Jang-jang</i>, ‘Asas,<a name="FNanchor_1424" id="FNanchor_1424"></a><a href="#Footnote_1424" class="fnanchor">1424</a> and Aūghān-bīrdī <i>Mughūl</i>. The musicians
were Rauḥ-dam, Bābā Jān, Qāsim-i-‘alī, Yūsuf-i-‘alī, Tīngrī-qulī,
Abū’l-qāsim, Rāmẓān <i>Lūlī</i>. We drank in the boat till the Bed-time
Prayer; then getting off it, full of drink, we mounted, took
torches in our hands, and went to camp from the river’s bank,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>leaning over from our horses on this side, leaning over from that,
at one loose-rein gallop! Very drunk I must have been for,
when they told me next day that we had galloped loose-rein
into camp, carrying torches, I could not recall it in the very least.
After reaching my quarters, I vomited a good deal.</p>

<p>(<i>March 11th</i>) On Friday we rode out on an excursion, crossed
the water (Jehlam) by boat and went about amongst the orchards
(<i>bāghāt</i>) of blossoming trees and the lands of the sugar-cultivation.
We saw the wheel with buckets, had water drawn, and asked
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;229.</span>particulars about getting it out; indeed we made them draw it
again and again. During this excursion a confection was preferred.
In returning we went on board a boat. A confection
(<i>ma’jūn</i>) was given also to Minūchihr Khān, such a one that, to
keep him standing, two people had to give him their arms. For
a time the boat remained at anchor in mid-stream; we then went
down-stream; after a while had it drawn up-stream again, slept
in it that night and went back to camp near dawn.</p>

<p>(<i>March 12th</i>) On Saturday the 10th of the first Rabī‘, the
Sun entered the Ram. Today we rode out before mid-day and
got into a boat where <i>‘araq</i> was drunk. The people of the party
were Khwāja Dost-khāwand, Dost Beg, Mīrīm, Mīrzā Qulī,
Muḥammadī, Aḥmadī, Yūnas-i-‘alī, Muḥ. ‘Alī <i>Jang-jang</i>, Gadāī
T̤aghāī, Mīr Khurd (and ?) ‘Asas. The musicians were Rauḥdam,
Bābā Jān, Qāsim, Yūsuf-i-‘alī, Tīngrī-qulī and Ramẓān.
We got into a branch-water (<i>shakh-i-āb</i>), for some time went
down-stream, landed a good deal below Bhīra and on its opposite
bank, and went late into camp.</p>

<p>This same day Shāh Ḥasan returned from Khūsh-āb whither
he had been sent as envoy to demand the countries which from
of old had depended on the Turk; he had settled peaceably with
them and had in his hands a part of the money assessed on them.</p>

<p>The heats were near at hand. To reinforce Hindū Beg (in
Bhīra) were appointed Shāh Muḥammad Keeper of the Seal
and his younger brother Dost Beg Keeper of the Seal, together
with several suitable braves; an accepted (<i>yārāsha</i>) stipend
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;229b.</span>was fixed and settled in accordance with each man’s position.
Khūsh-āb was bestowed, with a standard, on Langar Khān, the
prime cause and mover of this expedition; we settled also that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
he was to help Hindū Beg. We appointed also to help Hindū
Beg, the Turk and local soldiery of Bhīra, increasing the allowances
and pay of both. Amongst them was the afore-named
Minūchihr Khān whose name has been mentioned; there was
also Naz̤ar-i-‘alī <i>Turk</i>, one of Minūchihr Khān’s relations; there
were also Sangar Khān <i>Janjūha</i> and Malik Hast <i>Janjūha</i>.</p>

That day too it rained amazingly; people with rain-cloaks<a name="FNanchor_1425" id="FNanchor_1425"></a><a href="#Footnote_1425" class="fnanchor">1425</a> were

<p>(<i>March 14th</i>) People acquainted with the honour and glory

old foes of these Kakars, represented, “Hātī is the bad man
round-about; he it is robs on the roads; he it is brings men to
ruin; he ought either to be driven out from these parts, or to be

rode on again, our guide being a Gujūr servant of Malik Hast,
named Sar-u-pā. We rode the night through and dismounted
at dawn, when Beg Muḥammad <i>Mughūl</i> was sent back to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>camp, and we remounted when it was growing light. At breakfast-time
(9 a.m.) we put our mail on and moved forward faster.
The blackness of Parhāla shewed itself from 2 miles off; the
gallop was then allowed (<i>chāpqūn qūīūldī</i>); the right went east
of Parhāla, Qūj Beg, who was also of the right, following as its
reserve; the men of the left and centre went straight for the
fort, Dost Beg being their rear-reserve.</p>

<p>Parhāla stands amongst ravines. It has two roads; one, by
which we came, leads to it from the south-east, goes along the
top of ravines and on either hand has hollows worn out by the
torrents. A mile from Parhāla this road, in four or five places
before it reaches the Gate, becomes a one-man road with a
ravine falling from its either side; there for more than an
arrow’s flight men must ride in single file. The other road
comes from the north-west; it gets up to Parhāla by the trough
of a valley and it also is a one-man road. There is no other
road on any side. Parhāla though without breast-work or
battlement, has no assailable place, its sides shooting perpendicularly
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;230b.</span>down for 7, 8, 10 yards.</p>

<p>When the van of our left, having passed the narrow place,
went in a body to the Gate, Hātī, with whom were 30 to 40 men
in armour, their horses in mail, and a mass of foot-soldiers,
forced his assailants to retire. Dost Beg led his reserve forward,
made a strong attack, dismounted a number of Hātī’s men, and
beat him. All the country-round, Hātī was celebrated for his
daring, but try as he did, he could effect nothing; he took to
flight; he could not make a stand in those narrow places; he
could not make the fort fast when he got back into it. His
assailants went in just behind him and ran on through the
ravine and narrows of the north-west side of the fort, but he
rode light and made his flight good. Here again, Dost Beg did
very well and recompense was added to renown.<a name="FNanchor_1427" id="FNanchor_1427"></a><a href="#Footnote_1427" class="fnanchor">1427</a></p>

<p>Meantime I had gone into the fort and dismounted at Tātār
<i>Kakar’s</i> dwelling. Several men had joined in the attack for
whom to stay with me had been arranged; amongst them were
Amīn-i-muḥammad Tarkhān <i>Argkūn</i> and Qarācha.<a name="FNanchor_1428" id="FNanchor_1428"></a><a href="#Footnote_1428" class="fnanchor">1428</a> For this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>fault they were sent to meet the camp, without <i>sar-u-pā</i>, into
the wilds and open country with Sar-u-pā<a name="FNanchor_1429" id="FNanchor_1429"></a><a href="#Footnote_1429" class="fnanchor">1429</a> for their guide, the
Gujūr mentioned already.</p>

<p>(<i>March 16th</i>) Next day we went out by the north-west ravine
and dismounted in a sown field. A few serviceable braves under
Wālī the treasurer were sent out to meet the camp.<a name="FNanchor_1430" id="FNanchor_1430"></a><a href="#Footnote_1430" class="fnanchor">1430</a></p>

<p>(<i>March 17th</i>) Marching on Thursday the 15th, we dismounted
at Andarāba on the Sūhān, a fort said to have depended from<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;231.</span>
of old on ancestors of Malik Hast. Hātī <i>Kakar</i> had killed
Malik Hast’s father and destroyed the fort; there it now lay in
ruins.</p>

<p>At the Bed-time Prayer of this same day, those left at Kalda-kahār
with the camp rejoined us.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>r. Submissions to Bābur.</i>)</p>

<p>It must have been after Hātī overcame Tātār that he started
his kinsman Parbat to me with tribute and an accoutred horse.
Parbat did not light upon us but, meeting in with the camp we
had left behind, came on in the company of the train. With it
came also Langar Khān up from Bhīra on matters of business.
His affairs were put right and he, together with several local
people, was allowed to leave.</p>

<p>(<i>March 18th</i>) Marching on and crossing the Sūhān-water, we
dismounted on the rising-ground. Here Hātī’s kinsman (Parbat)
was robed in an honorary dress (<i>khil‘at</i>), given letters of
encouragement for Hātī, and despatched with a servant of
Muḥammad ‘Alī <i>Jang-jang</i>. Nīl-āb and the Qārlūq (Himalayan?)
Hazāra had been given to Humāyūn (<i>aet.</i> 12); some of his
servants under Bābā Dost and Halāhil came now for their
darogha-ship.<a name="FNanchor_1431" id="FNanchor_1431"></a><a href="#Footnote_1431" class="fnanchor">1431</a></p>

<p>(<i>March 19th</i>) Marching early next morning, we dismounted
after riding 2 miles, went to view the camp from a height and
ordered that the camp-camels should be counted; it came out
at 570.<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;231b.</span></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span></p>
<p>We had heard of the qualities of the saṃbhal plant<a name="FNanchor_1432" id="FNanchor_1432"></a><a href="#Footnote_1432" class="fnanchor">1432</a>; we saw
it on this ground; along this hill-skirt it grows sparsely, a plant
here, a plant there; it grows abundantly and to a large size
further along the skirt-hills of Hindūstān. It will be described
when an account is given of the animals and plants of
Hindūstān.<a name="FNanchor_1433" id="FNanchor_1433"></a><a href="#Footnote_1433" class="fnanchor">1433</a></p>

<p>(<i>March 20th</i>) Marching from that camp at beat of drum (<i>i.e.</i>
one hour before day), we dismounted at breakfast-time (9 a.m.)
below the Sangdakī-pass, at mid-day marched on, crossed the
pass, crossed the torrent, and dismounted on the rising-ground.</p>

<p>(<i>March 21st</i>) Marching thence at midnight, we made an
excursion to the ford<a name="FNanchor_1434" id="FNanchor_1434"></a><a href="#Footnote_1434" class="fnanchor">1434</a> we had crossed when on our way to Bhīra.
A great raft of grain had stuck in the mud of that same ford
and, do what its owners would, could not be made to move.
The corn was seized and shared out to those with us. Timely
indeed was that corn!</p>

<p>Near noon we were a little below the meeting of the waters
of Kābul and Sind, rather above old Nīl-āb; we dismounted
there between two waters.<a name="FNanchor_1435" id="FNanchor_1435"></a><a href="#Footnote_1435" class="fnanchor">1435</a> From Nīl-āb six boats were brought,
and were apportioned to the right, left and centre, who busied
themselves energetically in crossing the river (Indus). We got
there on a Monday; they kept on crossing the water through
the night preceding Tuesday (<i>March 22nd</i>), through Tuesday
and up to Wednesday (<i>March 23rd</i>) and on Thursday (<i>24th</i>)
also a few crossed.</p>

<p>Hātl’s kinsman Parbat, he who from Andarāba was sent to
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;232.</span>Hātī with a servant of Muḥ. ‘Alī <i>Jang-jang</i>, came to the bank
of the river with Hātī’s offering of an accoutred horse. Nīlābīs
also came, brought an accoutred horse and did obeisance.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>s. Various postings.</i>)</p>

<p>Muḥammad ‘Alī <i>Jang-jang</i> had wished to stay in Bhīra but
Bhīra being bestowed on Hindū Beg, he was given the countries
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>between it and the Sind-river, such as the Qārlūq Hazāra, Hātī,
Ghiyāṣ-wāl and Kīb (Kitib):&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Where one is who submits like a <i>ra‘iyat</i>, so treat him;</div>
<div class="line">But him who submits not, strike, strip, crush and force to obey.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>He also received a special head-wear in black velvet, a special
Qīlmāq corselet, and a standard. When Hātī’s kinsman was
given leave to go he took for Hātī a sword and head-to-foot
(<i>bāsh-ayāq</i>) with a royal letter of encouragement.</p>

<p>(<i>March 24th</i>) On Thursday at sunrise we marched from the
river’s bank. That day confection was eaten. While under its
influence<a name="FNanchor_1436" id="FNanchor_1436"></a><a href="#Footnote_1436" class="fnanchor">1436</a> wonderful fields of flowers were enjoyed. In some
places sheets of yellow flowers bloomed in plots; in others sheets
of red (<i>arghwānī</i>) flowers in plots, in some red and yellow
bloomed together. We sat on a mound near the camp to enjoy
the sight. There were flowers on all sides of the mound, yellow<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;232b.</span>
here, red there, as if arranged regularly to form a sextuple. On
two sides there were fewer flowers but as far as the eye reached,
flowers were in bloom. In spring near Parashāwar the fields of
flowers are very beautiful indeed.</p>

<p>(<i>March 25th</i>) We marched from that ground at dawn. At
one place on the road a tiger came out and roared. On hearing
it, the horses, willy-nilly, flung off in terror, carrying their riders
in all directions, and dashing into ravines and hollows. The
tiger went again into the jungle. To bring it out, we ordered
a buffalo brought and put on the edge of the jungle. The tiger
again came out roaring. Arrows were shot at it from all sides<a name="FNanchor_1437" id="FNanchor_1437"></a><a href="#Footnote_1437" class="fnanchor">1437</a>;
I shot with the rest. Khalwī (var. Khalwā) a foot-soldier,
pricked it with a spear; it bit the spear and broke off the spearhead.
After tasting of those arrows, it went into the bushes
(<i>būta</i>) and stayed there. Bābā the waiting-man [<i>yasāwal</i>] went
with drawn sword close up to it; it sprang; he chopped at its
head; ‘Alī <i>Sīstānī</i><a name="FNanchor_1438" id="FNanchor_1438"></a><a href="#Footnote_1438" class="fnanchor">1438</a> chopped at its loins; it plunged into the
river and was killed right in the water. It was got out and
ordered to be skinned.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span></p>
<p>(<i>March 26th</i>) Marching on next day, we reached Bīgrām and
went to see Gūr-khattrī. This is a smallish abode, after the
fashion of a hermitage (<i>ṣauma‘at</i>), rather confined and dark.
After entering at the door and going down a few steps, one must
lie full length to get beyond. There is no getting in without
a lamp. All round near the building there is let lie an enormous
quantity of hair of the head and beard which men have shaved
off there. There are a great many retreats (<i>ḥujra</i>) near Gūr-khattrī
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;233.</span>like those of a rest-house or a college. In the year we
came into Kābul (910 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>) and over-ran Kohāt, Bannū and the
plain, we made an excursion to Bīgrām, saw its great tree and
were consumed with regret at not seeing Gūr-khattrī, but it does
not seem a place to regret not-seeing.<a name="FNanchor_1439" id="FNanchor_1439"></a><a href="#Footnote_1439" class="fnanchor">1439</a></p>

<p>On this same day an excellent hawk of mine went astray out
of Shaikhīm the head-falconer’s charge; it had taken many
cranes and storks and had moulted (<i>tūlāb</i>) two or three times.
So many things did it take that it made a fowler of a person so
little keen as I!</p>

<p>At this place were bestowed 100 mis̤qāls of silver, clothing
(<i>tūnlūq</i>), three bullocks and one buffalo, out of the offerings of
Hindūstān, on each of six persons, the chiefs of the Dilazāk
Afghāns under Malik Bū Khān and Malik Mūsa; to others, in
their degree, were given money, pieces of cloth, a bullock and
a buffalo.</p>

<p>(<i>March 27th</i>) When we dismounted at ‘Alī-masjid, a Dilazāk
Afghān of the Yaq‘ūb-khail, named Ma‘rūf, brought an offering
of 10 sheep, two ass-loads of rice and eight large cheeses.</p>

<p>(<i>March 28th</i>) Marching on from ‘Alī-masjid, we dismounted
at Yada-bīr; from Yada-bīr Jūī-shāhī was reached by the Midday
Prayer and we there dismounted. Today Dost Beg was
attacked by burning fever.</p>

<p>(<i>March 29th</i>) Marching from Jūī-shāhī at dawn, we ate our
mid-day meal in the Bāgh-i-wafā. At the Mid-day Prayer we
betook ourselves out of the garden, close to the Evening Prayer
forded the Siyāh-āb at Gandamak, satisfied our horses’ hunger
in a field of green corn, and rode on in a <i>garī</i> or two (24-48 min.).</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span></p>
<p>After crossing the Sūrkh-āb, we dismounted at Kark and took<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;233b.</span>
a sleep.</p>

<p>(<i>March 30th</i>) Riding before shoot of day from Kark, I went
with 5 or 6 others by the road taking off for Qarā-tū in order to
enjoy the sight of a garden there made. Khalīfa and Shāh
Ḥasan Beg and the rest went by the other road to await me at
Qūrūq-sāī.</p>

<p>When we reached Qarā-tū, Shāh Beg <i>Arghūn’s</i> commissary
(<i>tawāchī</i>) Qīzīl (Rufus) brought word that Shāh Beg had taken
Kāhān, plundered it and retired.</p>

<p>An order had been given that no-one soever should take news
of us ahead. We reached Kābul at the Mid-day Prayer, no
person in it knowing about us till we got to Qūtlūq-qadam’s
bridge. As Humāyūn and Kāmrān heard about us only after
that, there was not time to put them on horseback; they made
their pages carry them, came, and did obeisance between the
gates of the town and the citadel.<a name="FNanchor_1440" id="FNanchor_1440"></a><a href="#Footnote_1440" class="fnanchor">1440</a> At the Other Prayer there
waited on me Qāsim Beg, the town Qāẓī, the retainers left in
Kābul and the notables of the place.</p>

<p>(<i>April 2nd</i>) At the Other Prayer of Friday the 1st of the
second Rabī‘ there was a wine-party at which a special head-to-foot
(<i>bāsh-ayāq</i>) was bestowed on Shāh Ḥasan.</p>

<p>(<i>April 3rd</i>) At dawn on Saturday we went on board a boat
and took our morning.<a name="FNanchor_1441" id="FNanchor_1441"></a><a href="#Footnote_1441" class="fnanchor">1441</a> Nūr Beg, then not obedient (<i>tā’īb</i>),
played the lute at this gathering. At the Mid-day Prayer we
left the boat to visit the garden made between Kul-kīna<a name="FNanchor_1442" id="FNanchor_1442"></a><a href="#Footnote_1442" class="fnanchor">1442</a> and
the mountain (Shāh-i-kābul). At the Evening Prayer we went
to the Violet-garden where there was drinking again. From
Kul-kīna I got in by the rampart and went into the citadel.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>u. Dost Beg’s death.</i>)</p>

<p>(<i>April 6th</i>) On the night of Tuesday the 5th of the month,<a name="FNanchor_1443" id="FNanchor_1443"></a><a href="#Footnote_1443" class="fnanchor">1443</a>
Dost Beg, who on the road had had fever, went to God’s mercy.<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;234.</span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span></p><p>Sad and grieved enough we were! His bier and corpse were
carried to Ghaznī where they laid him in front of the gate of the
Sult̤ān’s garden (<i>rauza</i>).</p>

<p>Dost Beg had been a very good brave (<i>yīkīt</i>) and he was still
rising in rank as a beg. Before he was made a beg, he did
excellent things several times as one of the household. One
time was at Rabāt̤-i-zauraq,<a name="FNanchor_1444" id="FNanchor_1444"></a><a href="#Footnote_1444" class="fnanchor">1444</a> one <i>yīghāch</i> from Andijān when
Sl. Aḥmad <i>Taṃbal</i> attacked me at night (908 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH</span>.). I, with 10
to 15 men, by making a stand, had forced his gallopers back;
when we reached his centre, he made a stand with as many as
100 men; there were then three men with me, <i>i.e.</i> there were
four counting myself. Nāṣir’s Dost (<i>i.e.</i> Dost Beg) was one of
the three; another was Mīrzā Qulī <i>Kūkūldāsh</i>; Karīm-dād
<i>Turkmān</i> was the other. I was just in my <i>jība</i><a name="FNanchor_1445" id="FNanchor_1445"></a><a href="#Footnote_1445" class="fnanchor">1445</a>; Taṃbal and
another were standing like gate-wards in front of his array;
I came face to face with Taṃbal, shot an arrow striking his
helm; shot another aiming at the attachment of his shield;<a name="FNanchor_1446" id="FNanchor_1446"></a><a href="#Footnote_1446" class="fnanchor">1446</a>
they shot one through my leg (<i>būtūm</i>); Taṃbal chopped at my
head. It was wonderful! The (under)-cap of my helm was on
my head; not a thread of it was cut, but on the head itself was
a very bad wound. Of other help came none; no-one was left
with me; of necessity I brought myself to gallop back. Dost
Beg had been a little in my rear; (Taṃbal) on leaving me alone,
chopped at him.<a name="FNanchor_1447" id="FNanchor_1447"></a><a href="#Footnote_1447" class="fnanchor">1447</a></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;234b.</span>Again, when we were getting out of Akhsī [908 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH</span>.],<a name="FNanchor_1448" id="FNanchor_1448"></a><a href="#Footnote_1448" class="fnanchor">1448</a> Dost

him <i>Ḥīz</i>, was a mighty master of the sword. Dost Beg was one
of the eight left with me after we were out of Akhsī; he was the
third they unhorsed.</p>

<p>Again, after he had become a beg, when Sīūnjuk Khān
(<i>Aūzbeg</i>), arriving with the (Aūzbeg) sult̤āns before Tāshkīnt,
besieged Aḥmad-i-qāsim [<i>Kohbur</i>] in it [918 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH</span>.],<a name="FNanchor_1450" id="FNanchor_1450"></a><a href="#Footnote_1450" class="fnanchor">1450</a> Dost Beg
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>passed through them and entered the town. During the siege
he risked his honoured life splendidly, but Aḥmad-i-qāsim,
without a word to this honoured man,<a name="FNanchor_1451" id="FNanchor_1451"></a><a href="#Footnote_1451" class="fnanchor">1451</a> flung out of the town and
got away. Dost Beg for his own part got the better of the Khān
and sult̤āns and made his way well out of Tāshkīnt.</p>

<p>Later on when Sherīm T̤aghāī, Mazīd and their adherents
were in rebellion,<a name="FNanchor_1452" id="FNanchor_1452"></a><a href="#Footnote_1452" class="fnanchor">1452</a> he came swiftly up from Ghaznī with two or
three hundred men, met three or four hundred effective braves
sent out by those same Mughūls to meet him, unhorsed a mass
of them near Sherūkān(?), cut off and brought in a number of
heads.</p>

<p>Again, his men were first over the ramparts at the fort of
Bajaur (925 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH</span>.). At Parhāla, again, he advanced, beat Hātī,
put him to flight, and won Parhāla.</p>

<p>After Dost Beg’s death, I bestowed his district on his younger
brother Nāṣir’s Mīrīm.<a name="FNanchor_1453" id="FNanchor_1453"></a><a href="#Footnote_1453" class="fnanchor">1453</a></p>

<p>(<i>April 9th</i>) On Friday the 8th of the second Rabī‘, the walled-town
was left for the Chār-bāgh.</p>

<p>(<i>April 13th</i>) On Tuesday the 12th there arrived in Kābul the
honoured Sult̤ānīm Begīm, Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā’s eldest daughter,
the mother of Muḥammad Sult̤ān Mīrzā. During those throneless
times,<a name="FNanchor_1454" id="FNanchor_1454"></a><a href="#Footnote_1454" class="fnanchor">1454</a> she had settled down in Khwārizm where Yīlī-pārs<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;235.</span>
Sult̤ān’s younger brother Aīsān-qulī Sl. took her daughter.
The Bāgh-i-khilwat was assigned her for her seat. When she
had settled down and I went to see her in that garden, out of
respect and courtesy to her, she being as my honoured elder
sister, I bent the knee. She also bent the knee. We both
advancing, saw one another mid-way. We always observed
the same ceremony afterwards.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>w. Visit to the Koh-dāman.</i>)</p>

<p>(<i>April 20th</i>) On Tuesday the 19th of the month, we rode out
at the return of noon for Khwāja Sih-yārān. This day I was
fasting. All astonished, Yūnas-i-‘alī and the rest said, “A
Tuesday! a journey! and a fast! This is amazing!” At Bīhzādī
we dismounted at the Qāẓī’s house. In the evening when
a stir was made for a social gathering, the Qāẓī set this before
me, “In my house such things never are; it is for the honoured
Pādshāh to command!” For his heart’s content, drink was left
out, though all the material for a party was ready.</p>

<p>(<i>April 21st</i>) On Wednesday we went to Khwāja Sih-yārān.</p>

<p>(<i>April 22nd</i>) On Thursday the 22nd of the month, we had
a large round seat made in the garden under construction on the
mountain-naze.<a name="FNanchor_1456" id="FNanchor_1456"></a><a href="#Footnote_1456" class="fnanchor">1456</a></p>

<p>(<i>April 23rd</i>) On Friday we got on a raft from the bridge.

<p>(<i>April 25th</i>) At dawn we took our morning on the new
seat. At noon we mounted and started for Kābul, reached
Khwāja Ḥasan quite drunk and slept awhile, rode on and by
midnight got to the Chār-bāgh. At Khwāja Ḥasan, ‘Abdu’l-lāh,
in his drunkenness, threw himself into water just as he was in his
<i>tūn aūfrāghī</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1460" id="FNanchor_1460"></a><a href="#Footnote_1460" class="fnanchor">1460</a> He was frozen with cold and could not go on
with us when we mounted after a little of the night had passed.
He stayed on Qūtlūq Khwāja’s estate that night. Next day,
awakened to his past intemperance, he came on repentant. Said
I, “At once! will this sort of repentance answer or not? Would
to God you would repent now at once in such a way that you
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>would drink nowhere except at my parties!” He agreed to
this and kept the rule for a few months, but could not keep it
longer.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>x. Hindū Beg abandons Bhīra.</i>)</p>

<p>(<i>April 26th</i>) On Monday the 25th came Hindū Beg. There
having been hope of peace, he had been left in those countries
with somewhat scant support. No sooner was our back turned
than a mass of Hindūstānīs and Afghāns gathered, disregarded
us and, not listening to our words, moved against Hindū Beg in
Bhīra. The local peoples also went over to the Afghāns. Hindū
Beg could make no stand in Bhīra, came to Khūsh-āb, came
through the Dīn-kot country, came to Nīl-āb, came on to Kābul.<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;236.</span>
Sīktū’s son Dīwa <i>Hindū</i> and another Hindū had been brought
prisoner from Bhīra. Each now giving a considerable ransom,
they were released. Horses and head-to-foot dresses having
been given them, leave to go was granted.</p>

<p>(<i>April 30th</i>) On Friday the 29th of the month, burning fever
appeared in my body. I got myself let blood. I had fever with
sometimes two, sometimes three days between the attacks. In
no attack did it cease till there had been sweat after sweat.
After 10 or 12 days of illness, Mullā Khwāja gave me narcissus
mixed with wine; I drank it once or twice; even that did
no good.</p>

<p>(<i>May 15th</i>) On Sunday the 15th of the first Jumāda<a name="FNanchor_1461" id="FNanchor_1461"></a><a href="#Footnote_1461" class="fnanchor">1461</a> Khwāja
Muḥammad ‘Alī came from Khwāst, bringing a saddled horse
as an offering and also <i>taṣadduq</i> money.<a name="FNanchor_1462" id="FNanchor_1462"></a><a href="#Footnote_1462" class="fnanchor">1462</a> Muḥ. Sharīf the
astrologer and the Mīr-zādas of Khwāst came with him and
waited on me.</p>

<p>(<i>May 16th</i>) Next day, Monday, Mullā Kabīr came from
Kāshghar; he had gone round by Kāshghar on his way from
Andijān to Kābul.</p>

<p>(<i>May 23rd</i>) On Monday the 23rd of the month, Malik Shāh
Manṣūr <i>Yūsuf-zāī</i> arrived from Sawād with 6 or 7 Yūsuf-zāī
chiefs, and did obeisance.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span></p>
<p>(<i>May 31st</i>) On Monday the 1st of the second Jumāda, the
chiefs of the Yūsuf-zāī Afghāns led by Malik Shāh Manṣūr were
dressed in robes of honour (<i>khil‘at</i>). To Malik Shāh Manṣūr
was given a long silk coat and an under-coat (? <i>jība</i>) with its
buttons; to one of the other chiefs was given a coat with silk
sleeves, and to six others silk coats. To all leave to go was
granted. Agreement was made with them that they were not
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;236b.</span>to reckon as in the country of Sawād what was above Abuha (?),
that they should make all the peasants belonging to it go out
from amongst themselves, and also that the Afghān cultivators
of Bajaur and Sawād should cast into the revenue 6000 ass-loads
of rice.</p>

<p>(<i>June 2nd</i>) On Wednesday the 3rd, I drank <i>jul-āb</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1463" id="FNanchor_1463"></a><a href="#Footnote_1463" class="fnanchor">1463</a></p>

<p>(<i>June 5th</i>) On Saturday the 6th, I drank a working-draught
(<i>dārū-i-kār</i>).</p>

<p>(<i>June 7th</i>) On Monday the 8th, arrived the wedding-gift for
the marriage of Qāsim Beg’s youngest son Ḥamza with Khalīfa’s
eldest daughter. It was of 1000 <i>shāhrukhī</i>; they offered also
a saddled horse.</p>

<p>(<i>June 8th</i>) On Tuesday Shāh Beg’s Shāh Ḥasan asked for
permission to go away for a wine-party. He carried off to his
house Khwāja Muḥ. ‘Alī and some of the household-begs. In
my presence were Yūnas-i-‘alī and Gadāī T̤aghāī. I was still
abstaining from wine. Said I, “Not at all in this way is it
(<i>hech andāq būlmāī dūr</i>) that I will sit sober and the party drink
wine, I stay sane, full of water, and that set (<i>būlāk</i>) of people get
drunk; come you and drink in my presence! I will amuse
myself a little by watching what intercourse between the sober
and the drunk is like.”<a name="FNanchor_1464" id="FNanchor_1464"></a><a href="#Footnote_1464" class="fnanchor">1464</a> The party was held in a smallish tent
in which I sometimes sat, in the Plane-tree garden south-east
of the Picture-hall. Later on Ghiyāṣ the house-buffoon (<i>kīdī</i>)
arrived; several times for fun he was ordered kept out, but at
last he made a great disturbance and his buffooneries found him
a way in. We invited Tardī Muḥammad <i>Qībchāq</i> also and</p>

<p>It was sent by Ibrāhīm <i>chuhra</i>. Between the two Prayers (<i>i.e.</i>
afternoon) the party broke up drunk.</p>

<p>I used to go about in a litter while I was ill. The wine-mixture
was drunk on several of the earlier days, then, as it did no good
I left it off, but I drank it again at the end of my convalescence,
at a party had under an apple-tree on the south-west side of the
Tālār-garden.</p>

<p>(<i>June 11th</i>) On Friday the 12th came Aḥmad Beg and Sl.
Muḥammad <i>Dūldāī</i> who had been left to help in Bajaur.</p>

<p>(<i>June 16th</i>) On Wednesday the 17th of the month, Tīngrī-bīrdī
and other braves gave a party in Ḥaidar <i>Tāqi’s</i> garden;
I also went and there drank. We rose from it at the Bed-time
Prayer when a move was made to the great tent where again
there was drinking.</p>

<p>(<i>June 23rd</i>) On Thursday the 25th of the month, Mullā
Maḥmūd was appointed to read extracts from the Qorān<a name="FNanchor_1466" id="FNanchor_1466"></a><a href="#Footnote_1466" class="fnanchor">1466</a> in
my presence.</p>

<p>(<i>June 28th</i>) On Tuesday the last day of the month, Abū’l-muslim
Kūkūldāsh arrived as envoy from Shāh Shujā‘ <i>Arghūn</i>
bringing a <i>tīpūchāq</i>. After bargain made about swimming
the reservoir in the Plane-tree garden, Yūsuf-i-‘alī the stirrup-holder
swam round it today 100 times and received a gift of
a head-to-foot (dress), a saddled horse and some money.</p>

<p>(<i>July 6th</i>) On Wednesday the 8th of Rajab, I went to Shāh
Ḥasan’s house and drank there; most of the household and of<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;237b.</span>
the begs were present.</p>

<p>(<i>July 9th</i>) On Saturday the 11th, there was drinking on the
terrace-roof of the pigeon-house between the Afternoon and
Evening Prayers. Rather late a few horsemen were observed,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>going from Dih-i-afghān towards the town. It was made out
to be Darwīsh-i-muḥammad <i>Sārbān</i>, on his way to me as the
envoy of Mīrzā Khān (Wais). We shouted to him from the roof,
“Drop the envoy’s forms and ceremonies! Come! come without
formality!” He came and sat down in the company. He was
then obedient and did not drink. Drinking went on till the end
of the evening. Next day he came into the Court Session with
due form and ceremony, and presented Mīrzā Khān’s gifts.</p>

<p>Last year<a name="FNanchor_1467" id="FNanchor_1467"></a><a href="#Footnote_1467" class="fnanchor">1467</a> with 100 efforts, much promise and threats, we had
got the clans to march into Kābul from the other side (of Hindū-kush).
Kābul is a confined country, not easily giving summer
and winter quarters to the various flocks and herds of the Turks
and (Mughūl?) clans. If the dwellers in the wilds follow their
own hearts, they do not wish for Kābul! They now waited
(<i>khidmat qīlīb</i>) on Qāsim Beg and made him their mediator
with me for permission to re-cross to that other side. He tried
very hard, so in the end, they were allowed to cross over to the
Qūndūz and Bāghlān side.</p>

<p>(<i>July 15th</i>) On Friday the 17th of the month, Shaikh Mazīd
Kūkūldāsh waited on me from Muḥammad-i-zamān Mīrzā,
bringing <i>taṣadduq</i> tribute and a horse.<a name="FNanchor_1470" id="FNanchor_1470"></a><a href="#Footnote_1470" class="fnanchor">1470</a> Today Shāh Beg’s

own districts of Khwāst and Andar-āb to Khwāja Muḥammad
‘Alī and Tīngrī-bīrdī.</p>

<p>(<i>July 21st</i>) On Thursday the 23rd came Muḥ. ‘Alī <i>Jang-jang</i>
who had been left in charge of the countries near Kacha-kot
and the Qārlūq. With him came one of Hātī’s people and
Mīrzā-i-malū-i-qārlūq’s son Shāh Ḥasan. Today Mullā ‘Alī-jān

<p class="indent">(<i>z. The ‘Abdu’r-raḥman Afghāns and Rustam-maidān.</i>)</p>

<p>(<i>July 27th</i>) The ‘Abdu’r-raḥman Afghāns on the Gīrdīz border
were satisfactory neither in their tribute nor their behaviour;
they were hurtful also to the caravans which came and went.
On Wednesday the 29th of Rajab we rode out to over-run them.
We dismounted and ate food near Tang-i-waghchān,<a name="FNanchor_1471" id="FNanchor_1471"></a><a href="#Footnote_1471" class="fnanchor">1471</a> and rode
on again at the Mid-day Prayer. In the night we lost the road
and got much bewildered in the ups and downs of the land to
the south-east of Pātakh-i-āb-i-shakna.<a name="FNanchor_1472" id="FNanchor_1472"></a><a href="#Footnote_1472" class="fnanchor">1472</a> After a time we lit on<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;238b.</span>
a road and by it crossed the Chashma-i-tūra<a name="FNanchor_1473" id="FNanchor_1473"></a><a href="#Footnote_1473" class="fnanchor">1473</a> pass.</p>

<p>(<i>July 28th</i>) At the first prayer (<i>farẓ-waqt</i>) we got out from
the valley-bottom adjacent<a name="FNanchor_1474" id="FNanchor_1474"></a><a href="#Footnote_1474" class="fnanchor">1474</a> to the level land, and the raid was
allowed. One detachment galloped towards the Kar-māsh<a name="FNanchor_1475" id="FNanchor_1475"></a><a href="#Footnote_1475" class="fnanchor">1475</a>
mountain, south-east of Gīrdīz, the left-hand of the centre led
by Khusrau, Mīrzā Qulī and Sayyid ‘Alī in their rear. Most of
the army galloped up the dale to the east of Gīrdīz, having in
their rear men under Sayyid Qāsim Lord of the Gate, Mīr Shāh
<i>Qūchīn</i>, Qayyām (Aūrdū-shāh Beg?), Hindū Beg, Qūtlūq-qadam
and Ḥusain [Ḥasan?]. Most of the army having gone up the
dale, I followed at some distance. The dalesmen must have
been a good way up; those who went after them wore their
horses out and nothing to make up for this fell into their hands.</p>

<p>Some Afghāns on foot, some 40 or 50 of them, having appeared
on the plain, the rear-reserve went towards them. A courier
was sent to me and I hastened on at once. Before I got up
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>with them, Ḥusain Ḥāsan, all alone, foolishly and thoughtlessly,
put his horse at those Afghāns, got in amongst them and began
to lay on with his sword. They shot his horse, thus made him
fall, slashed at him as he was getting up, flung him down, knifed
him from all sides and cut him to pieces, while the other braves
looked on, standing still and reaching him no helping hand!
On hearing news of it, I hurried still faster forward, and sent
some of the household and braves galloping loose-rein ahead
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;239.</span>under Gadāī T̤aghāī, Payānda-i-muḥammad <i>Qīplān</i>, Abū’l-ḥasan
the armourer and Mūmin Ātāka. Mūmin Ātāka was the first
of them to bring an Afghān down; he speared one, cut off his
head and brought it in. Abū’l-ḥasan the armourer, without
mail as he was, went admirably forward, stopped in front of the
Afghāns, laid his horse at them, chopped at one, got him down,
cut off and brought in his head. Known though both were for
bravelike deeds done earlier, their action in this affair added to
their fame. Every one of those 40 or 50 Afghāns, falling to
the arrow, falling to the sword, was cut in pieces. After making
a clean sweep of them, we dismounted in a field of growing corn
and ordered a tower of their heads to be set up. As we went
along the road I said, with anger and scorn, to the begs who
had been with Ḥusain, “You! what men! there you stood on
quite flat ground, and looked on while a few Afghāns on foot
overcame such a brave in the way they did! Your rank and
station must be taken from you; you must lose <i>pargana</i> and
country; your beards must be shaved off and you must be
exhibited in towns; for there shall be punishment assuredly for
him who looks on while such a brave is beaten by such a foe
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;239b.</span>on dead-level land, and reaches out no hand to help!” The
troop which went to Kar-māsh brought back sheep and other
spoil. One of them was Bābā Qashqa<a name="FNanchor_1476" id="FNanchor_1476"></a><a href="#Footnote_1476" class="fnanchor">1476</a> <i>Mughūl</i>; an Afghān
had made at him with a sword; he had stood still to adjust an
arrow, shot it off and brought his man down.</p>

<p>(<i>July 29th</i>) Next day at dawn we marched for Kābul. Pay-aster
Muḥammad, ‘Abdu’l-‘azīz Master of the Horse, and Mīr
Khūrd the taster were ordered to stop at Chashma-tūra, and
get pheasants from the people there.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span></p>
<p>As I had never been along the Rustam-maidān road,<a name="FNanchor_1477" id="FNanchor_1477"></a><a href="#Footnote_1477" class="fnanchor">1477</a> I went
with a few men to see it. Rustam-plain (<i>maidān</i>) lies amongst
mountains and towards their head is not a very charming place.
The dale spreads rather broad between its two ranges. To the
south, on the skirt of the rising-ground is a smallish spring,
having very large poplars near it. There are many trees also,
but not so large, at the source on the way out of Rustam-maidān
for Gīrdīz. This is a narrower dale, but still there is a plot of
green meadow below the smaller trees mentioned, and the little
dale is charming. From the summit of the range, looking south,
the Karmāsh and Bangash mountains are seen at one’s feet; and
beyond the Karmāsh show pile upon pile of the rain-clouds of
Hindūstān. Towards those other lands where no rain falls, not<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;240.</span>
a cloud is seen.</p>

<p>We reached Hūnī at the Mid-day Prayer and there dismounted.</p>

<p>(<i>July 30th</i>) Dismounting next day at Muḥammad Āghā’s
village,<a name="FNanchor_1478" id="FNanchor_1478"></a><a href="#Footnote_1478" class="fnanchor">1478</a> we perpetrated (<i>irtqāb</i>) a <i>ma’jūn</i>. There we had a drug
thrown into water for the fish; a few were taken.<a name="FNanchor_1479" id="FNanchor_1479"></a><a href="#Footnote_1479" class="fnanchor">1479</a></p>

<p class="indent">(<i>July 31st</i>) On Sunday the 3rd of Sha‘bān, we reached Kābul.</p>

<p>(<i>August 2nd</i>) On Tuesday the 5th of the month, Darwīsh-i-muḥammad
<i>Faẓlī</i> and Khusrau’s servants were summoned and,
after enquiry made into what short-comings of theirs there may
have been when Ḥusain was overcome, they were deprived of
place and rank. At the Mid-day Prayer there was a wine-party
under a plane-tree, at which an honorary dress was given to
Bābā Qashqa <i>Mughūl</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>August 5th</i>) On Friday the 8th Kīpa returned from the
presence of Mīrzā Khān.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>aa. Excursion to the Koh-dāman.</i>)</p>

<p>(<i>August 11th</i>) On Thursday at the Other Prayer, I mounted for

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span></p>

<p>(<i>August 12th</i>) Next day we dismounted at Istālīf; a confection
was eaten on that day.</p>

<p>(<i>August 13th</i>) On Saturday there was a wine-party at
Istālīf.</p>

<p>(<i>August 14th</i>) Riding at dawn from Istālīf, we crossed the
space between it and the Sinjid-valley. Near Khwāja Sih-yārān
a great snake was killed as thick, it may be, as the fore-arm and
as long as a <i>qūlāch</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1482" id="FNanchor_1482"></a><a href="#Footnote_1482" class="fnanchor">1482</a> From its inside came out a slenderer snake,
that seemed to have been just swallowed, every part of it being
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;240b.</span>whole; it may have been a little shorter than the larger one.
From inside this slenderer snake came out a little mouse; it too
was whole, broken nowhere.<a name="FNanchor_1483" id="FNanchor_1483"></a><a href="#Footnote_1483" class="fnanchor">1483</a></p>

<p>On reaching Khwāja Sih-yārān there was a wine-party. Today
orders were written and despatched by Kīch-kīna the
night-watch (<i>tūnqt̤ār</i>) to the begs on that side (<i>i.e.</i> north of
Hindū-kush), giving them a rendezvous and saying, “An army
is being got to horse, take thought, and come to the rendezvous
fixed.”</p>

<p>(<i>August 15th</i>) We rode out at dawn and ate a confection. At
the infall of the Parwān-water many fish were taken in the
local way of casting a fish-drug into the water.<a name="FNanchor_1484" id="FNanchor_1484"></a><a href="#Footnote_1484" class="fnanchor">1484</a> Mīr Shāh Beg
set food and water (<i>āsh u āb</i>) before us; we then rode on to
Gul-bahār. At a wine-party held after the Evening Prayer,
Darwīsh-i-muḥammad (<i>Sārbān</i>) was present. Though a young
man and a soldier, he had not yet committed the sin (<i>irtqāb</i>) of
wine, but was in obedience (<i>tā’ib</i>). Qūtlūq Khwāja <i>Kūkūldāsh</i>
had long before abandoned soldiering to become a darwīsh;
moreover he was very old, his very beard was quite white;
nevertheless he took his share of wine at these parties. Said
I to Darwīsh-i-muḥammad, “Qūtlūq Khwāja’s beard shames
you! He, a darwīsh and an old man, always drinks wine;
you, a soldier, a young man, your beard quite black, never
drink! What does it mean?” My custom being not to press
wine on a non-drinker, with so much said, it all passed off as
a joke; he was not pressed to drink.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span></p>
<p>(<i>August 16th</i>) At dawn we made our morning (<i>ṣubāḥī ṣubūḥī
qīldūk</i>).</p>

<p>(<i>August 17th</i>) Riding on Wednesday from Gul-i-bahār, we<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;241.</span>
dismounted in Abūn-village<a name="FNanchor_1485" id="FNanchor_1485"></a><a href="#Footnote_1485" class="fnanchor">1485</a>, ate food, remounted, went to
a summer-house in the orchards (<i>bāghāt-i-kham</i>) and there dismounted.
There was a wine-party after the Mid-day Prayer.</p>

<p>(<i>August 18th</i>) Riding on next day, we made the circuit of
Khwāja Khāwand Sa‘īd’s tomb, went to China-fort and there
got on a raft. Just where the Panjhīr-water comes in, the raft
struck the naze of a hill and began to sink. Rauḥ-dam, Tīngrī-qulī
and Mīr Muḥammad the raftsman were thrown into the
water by the shock; Rauḥ-dam and Tīngrī-qulī were got on
the raft again; a China cup and a spoon and a t̤ambour went
into the water. Lower down, the raft struck again opposite the
Sang-i-barīda (the cut-stone), either on a branch in mid-stream
or on a stake stuck in as a stop-water (<i>qāqghān qāzūq</i>). Right
over on his back went Shāh Beg’s Shāh Ḥasan, clutching at
Mīrzā Qulī Kūkūldāsh and making him fall too. Darwīsh-i-muḥammad
<i>Sārbān</i> was also thrown into the water. Mīrzā
Qulī went over in his own fashion! Just when he fell, he was
cutting a melon which he had in his hand; as he went over, he
stuck his knife into the mat of the raft. He swam in his <i>tūn
aūfrāghī</i><a name="FNanchor_1486" id="FNanchor_1486"></a><a href="#Footnote_1486" class="fnanchor">1486</a> and got out of the water without coming on the raft
again. Leaving it that night, we slept at raftsmen’s houses.
Darwīsh-i-muḥammad <i>Sārbān</i> presented me with a seven-coloured
cup exactly like the one lost in the water.</p>

<p>(<i>August 19th</i>) On Friday we rode away from the river’s
bank and dismounted below Aīndīkī on the skirt of Koh-i-bacha
where, with our own hands, we gathered plenty of tooth-picks.<a name="FNanchor_1487" id="FNanchor_1487"></a><a href="#Footnote_1487" class="fnanchor">1487</a><span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;241b.</span>
Passing on, food was eaten at the houses of the Khwāja Khiẓr
people. We rode on and at the Mid-day Prayer, dismounted
in a village of Qūtlūq Khwāja’s fief in Lamghān where he made
ready a hasty meal (<i>mā ḥaẓirī</i>); after partaking of this, we
mounted and went to Kābul.</p>

<p>(<i>August 22nd</i>) On Monday the 25th, a special honorary
dress and a saddled horse were bestowed on Darwīsh-i-muḥammad
<i>Sārbān</i> and he was made to kneel as a retainer
(<i>naukar</i>).</p>

<p>(<i>August 24th</i>) For 4 or 5 months I had not had my head
shaved; on Wednesday the 27th, I had it done. Today there
was a wine-party.</p>

<p>(<i>August 26th</i>) On Friday the 29th, Mīr Khūrd was made to
kneel as Hind-āl’s guardian.<a name="FNanchor_1488" id="FNanchor_1488"></a><a href="#Footnote_1488" class="fnanchor">1488</a> He made an offering of 1000
<i>shāhrukhīs</i> (<i>circa</i> &pound;50).</p>

<p>(<i>August 31st</i>) On Wednesday the 5th of Ramẓān, a dutiful
letter was brought by Tūlik Kūkūldāsh’s servant Barlās Jūkī(?).
Aūzbeg raiders had gone into those parts (Badakhshān); Tūlik
had gone out, fought and beaten them. Barlās Jūkī brought
one live Aūzbeg and one head.</p>

<p>(<i>Sep. 2nd</i>) In the night of Saturday the 8th, we broke our
fast<a name="FNanchor_1489" id="FNanchor_1489"></a><a href="#Footnote_1489" class="fnanchor">1489</a> in Qāsim Beg’s house; he led out a saddled horse for me.</p>

<p>(<i>Sep. 3rd</i>) On Sunday night the fast was broken in Khalīfa’s
house; he offered me a saddled horse.</p>

<p>(<i>Sep. 4th</i>) Next day came Khwāja Muḥ. ‘Alī and Jān-i-nāṣir
who had been summoned from their districts for the good of
the army.<a name="FNanchor_1490" id="FNanchor_1490"></a><a href="#Footnote_1490" class="fnanchor">1490</a></p>

<p>(<i>Sep. 7th</i>) On Wednesday the 12th, Kāmrān’s maternal uncle
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;242.</span>Sl. ‘Alī Mīrzā arrived.<a name="FNanchor_1491" id="FNanchor_1491"></a><a href="#Footnote_1491" class="fnanchor">1491</a> As has been mentioned,<a name="FNanchor_1492" id="FNanchor_1492"></a><a href="#Footnote_1492" class="fnanchor">1492</a> he had gone
to Kāshghar in the year I came from Khwāst into Kābul.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>cc. A Yūsuf-zāī campaign.</i>)</p>

<p>(<i>Sep. 8th</i>) We rode out on Thursday the 13th of the month
of Ramẓān, resolved and determined to check and ward off the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>Yūsuf-zāī, and we dismounted in the meadow on the Dih-i-yaq‘ūb
side of Kābul. When we were mounting, the equerry
Bābā Jān led forward a rather good-for-nothing horse; in my
anger I struck him in the face a blow which dislocated my fist
below the ring-finger.<a name="FNanchor_1493" id="FNanchor_1493"></a><a href="#Footnote_1493" class="fnanchor">1493</a> The pain was not much at the time,
but was rather bad when we reached our encampment-ground.
For some time I suffered a good deal and could not write. It
got well at last.</p>

<p>To this same assembly-ground were brought letters and
presents (<i>bīlāk</i>) from my maternal-aunt Daulat-sult̤ān Khānīm<a name="FNanchor_1494" id="FNanchor_1494"></a><a href="#Footnote_1494" class="fnanchor">1494</a>
in Kāshghar, by her foster-brother Daulat-i-muḥammad. On the
same day Bū Khān and Mūsa, chiefs of the Dilazāk, came,
bringing tribute, and did obeisance.</p>

<p>(<i>Sep. 11th</i>) On Sunday the 16th Qūj Beg came.</p>

<p>(<i>Sep. 14th</i>) Marching on Wednesday the 19th we passed
through Būt-khāk and, as usual, dismounted on the Būt-khāk
water.<a name="FNanchor_1495" id="FNanchor_1495"></a><a href="#Footnote_1495" class="fnanchor">1495</a></p>

<p>As Qūj Beg’s districts, Bāmīān, Kāh-mard and Ghūrī, are
close to the Aūzbeg, he was excused from going with this army
and given leave to return to them from this ground. I bestowed
on him a turban twisted for myself, and also a head-to-foot
(<i>bāsh-ayāq</i>).</p>

<p>(<i>Sep. 16th</i>) On Friday the 21st, we dismounted at Badām-chashma.<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;242b.</span></p>

<p>(<i>Sep. 17th</i>) Next day we dismounted on the Bārīk-āb, I reaching
the camp after a visit to Qarā-tū. On this ground honey was
obtained from a tree.</p>

<p>(<i>Sep. 20th</i>) We went on march by march till Wednesday
the 26th, and dismounted in the Bāgh-i-wafā.</p>

<p>(<i>Sep. 21st</i>) Thursday we just stayed in the garden.</p>

<p>(<i>Sep. 22nd</i>) On Friday we marched out and dismounted
beyond Sult̤ānpūr. Today Shāh Mīr Ḥusain came from his
country. Today came also Dilazāk chiefs under Bū Khān and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>Mūsa. My plan had been to put down the Yūsuf-zāī in Sawād,
but these chiefs set forth to me that there was a large horde
(<i>aūlūs</i>) in Hash-naghar and that much corn was to be had there.
They were very urgent for us to go to Hash-naghar. After
consultation the matter was left in this way:&mdash;As it is said there
is much corn in Hash-naghar, the Afghāns there shall be overrun;
the forts of Hash-naghar and Parashāwar shall be put into
order; part of the corn shall be stored in them and they be left
in charge of Shāh Mīr Ḥusain and a body of braves. To suit
Shāh Mīr Ḥusain’s convenience in this, he was given 15 days
leave, with a rendezvous named for him to come to after going
to his country and preparing his equipment.</p>

<p>(<i>Sep. 23rd</i>) Marching on next day, we reached Jūī-shāhī
and there dismounted. On this ground Tīngrī-bīrdī and
Sl. Muḥammad <i>Dūldāī</i> overtook us. Today came also Ḥamza
from Qūndūz.<a name="FNanchor_1496" id="FNanchor_1496"></a><a href="#Footnote_1496" class="fnanchor">1496</a></p>

<p>(<i>Sep. 25th</i>) On Sunday the last day of the month (Ramẓān),
we marched from Jūī-shāhī and dismounted at Qīrīq-arīq (forty-conduits),
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;243.</span>I going by raft, with a special few. The new
moon of the Feast was seen at that station.<a name="FNanchor_1497" id="FNanchor_1497"></a><a href="#Footnote_1497" class="fnanchor">1497</a> People had
brought a few beast-loads of wine from Nūr-valley;<a name="FNanchor_1498" id="FNanchor_1498"></a><a href="#Footnote_1498" class="fnanchor">1498</a> after the
Evening Prayer there was a wine-party, those present being
Muḥibb-i-‘alī the armourer, Khwāja Muḥ. ‘Alī the librarian,
Shāh Beg’s Shāh Ḥasan, Sl. Muḥ. <i>Dūldāī</i> and Darwīsh-i-muḥ.
<i>Sārbān,</i> then obedient (<i>tā’ib</i>). From my childhood up it had
been my rule not to press wine on a non-drinker; Darwīsh-i-muḥammad
was at every party and no pressure was put on him
(by me), but Khwāja Muḥ. ‘Alī left him no choice; he pressed
him and pressed him till he made him drink.</p>

<p>(<i>Sep. 26th</i>) On Monday we marched with the dawn of the
Feast-day,<a name="FNanchor_1499" id="FNanchor_1499"></a><a href="#Footnote_1499" class="fnanchor">1499</a> eating a confection on the road to dispel crop-sickness.
While under its composing influence (<i>nāklīk</i>), we were brought
a colocynth-apple (<i>khunt̤ul</i>). Darwīsh-i-muḥammad had never
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>seen one; said I, “It is a melon of Hindūstān,” sliced it and
gave him a piece. He bit into it at once; it was night before
the bitter taste went out of his mouth. At Garm-chashma we
dismounted on rising-ground where cold meat was being set
out for us when Langar Khān arrived to wait on me after being
for a time at his own place (Koh-i-jūd). He brought an offering
of a horse and a few confections. Passing on, we dismounted
at Yada-bīr, at the Other Prayer got on a raft there, went for
as much as two miles on it, then left it.</p>

<p>(<i>Sep. 27th</i>) Riding on next morning, we dismounted below
the Khaibar-pass. Today arrived Sl. Bāyazīd, come up by the<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;243b.</span>
Bāra-road after hearing of us; he set forth that the Afrīdī
Afghāns were seated in Bāra with their goods and families and
that they had grown a mass of corn which was still standing
(lit. on foot). Our plan being for the Yūsuf-zāī Afghāns of
Hash-naghar, we paid him no attention. At the Mid-day Prayer
there was a wine-party in Khwāja Muḥammad ‘Alī’s tent.
During the party details about our coming in this direction were
written and sent off by the hand of a sult̤ān of Tīrah to Khwāja
Kalān in Bajaur. I wrote this couplet on the margin of the
letter (<i>farmān</i>):&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Say sweetly o breeze, to that beautiful fawn,</div>

</div></div></div>

<p>(<i>Sep. 28th</i>) Marching on at dawn across the pass, we got
through the Khaibar-narrows and dismounted at ‘Alī-masjid.
At the Mid-day Prayer we rode on, leaving the baggage behind,
reached the Kābul-water at the second watch (midnight) and
there slept awhile.</p>

<p>(<i>Sep. 29th</i>) A ford<a name="FNanchor_1501" id="FNanchor_1501"></a><a href="#Footnote_1501" class="fnanchor">1501</a> was found at daylight; we had forded
the water (<i>sū-dīn kīchīldī</i>), when news came from our scout that
the Afghāns had heard of us and were in flight. We went on,
passed through the Sawād-water and dismounted amongst the
Afghān corn-fields. Not a half, not a fourth indeed of the
promised corn was had. The plan of fitting-up Hash-naghar,
made under the hope of getting corn here, came to nothing.<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;244.</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>The Dilazāk Afghāns, who had urged it on us, were ashamed.
We next dismounted after fording the water of Sawād to its
Kābul side.</p>

<p>(<i>Sep. 30th</i>) Marching next morning from the Sawād-water, we
crossed the Kābul-water and dismounted. The Begs admitted
to counsel were summoned and a consultation having been had,
the matter was left at this:&mdash;that the Afrīdī Afghāns spoken of
by Sl. Bāyazīd should be over-run, Pūrshāwūr-fort be fitted up
on the strength of their goods and corn, and some-one left there
in charge.</p>

<p>At this station Hindū Beg <i>Qūchīn</i> and the Mīr-zādas of
Khwāst overtook us. Today <i>ma’jūn</i> was eaten, the party being
Darwesh-i-muḥammad <i>Sārbān</i>, Muḥammad Kūkūldāsh, Gadāī
T̤aghāī and ‘Asas; later on we invited Shāh Ḥasan also. After
food had been placed before us, we went on a raft, at the Other
Prayer. We called Langar Khān <i>Nīa-zāī</i> on also. At the
Evening Prayer we got off the raft and went to camp.</p>

<p>(<i>Oct. 1st</i>) Marching at dawn, in accordance with the arrangement
made on the Kābul-water, we passed Jām and dismounted
at the outfall of the ‘Alī-masjid water.<a name="FNanchor_1502" id="FNanchor_1502"></a><a href="#Footnote_1502" class="fnanchor">1502</a></p>

<p class="indent">(<i>dd. Badakhshān affairs.</i>)</p>

<p>Sl. ‘Alī (T̤aghāī’s servant ?) Abū’l-hāshim overtaking us, said,
“On the night of ‘Arafa,<a name="FNanchor_1503" id="FNanchor_1503"></a><a href="#Footnote_1503" class="fnanchor">1503</a> I was in Jūī-shāhī with a person from
Badakhshān; he told me that Sl. Sa‘īd Khān had come with
designs on Badakhshān, so I came on from Jūī-shāhī along the
Jām-rūd, to give the news to the Pādshāh.” On this the begs
were summoned and advice was taken. In consequence of this
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;244b.</span>news, it seemed inadvisable to victual the fort (Pūrshāwūr), and
we started back intending to go to Badakhshān.<a name="FNanchor_1504" id="FNanchor_1504"></a><a href="#Footnote_1504" class="fnanchor">1504</a> Langar Khān
was appointed to help Muḥ. ‘Alī <i>Jang-jang</i>; he was given an
honorary dress and allowed to go.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span></p>
<p>That night a wine-party was held in Khwāja Muḥ. ‘Alī’s tent.
We marched on next day, crossed Khaibar and dismounted
below the pass.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>ee. The Khiẓr-khail Afghāns.</i>)</p>

<p>(<i>Oct. 3rd</i>) Many improper things the Khiẓr-khail had done!
When the army went to and fro, they used to shoot at the
laggards and at those dismounted apart, in order to get their
horses. It seemed lawful therefore and right to punish them.
With this plan we marched from below the pass at daybreak,
ate our mid-day meal in Dih-i-ghulāmān (Basaul),<a name="FNanchor_1505" id="FNanchor_1505"></a><a href="#Footnote_1505" class="fnanchor">1505</a> and after
feeding our horses, rode on again at the Mid-day Prayer.</p>

<p>Muḥ. Ḥusain the armourer was made to gallop off to Kābul
with orders to keep prisoner all Khiẓr-khailīs there, and to
submit to me an account of their possessions; also, to write
a detailed account of whatever news there was from Badakhshān
and to send a man off with it quickly from Kābul to me.</p>

<p>That night we moved on till the second watch (midnight),
got a little beyond Sult̤ānpūr, there slept awhile, then rode on
again. The Khiẓr-khail were understood to have their seat
from Bahār (Vihāra?) and Mīch-grām to Karā-sū (<i>sic</i>). Arriving
before dawn, (<i>Oct. 4th</i>) the raid was allowed. Most of the goods
of the Khiẓr-khailīs and their small children fell into the army’s
hands; a few tribesmen, being near the mountains, drew off to<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;245.</span>
them and were left.</p>

<p>(<i>Oct. 5th</i>) We dismounted next day at Qīlaghū where
pheasants were taken on our ground. Today the baggage came
up from the rear and was unloaded here. Owing to this punitive
raid, the Wazīrī Afghāns who never had given in their tribute
well, brought 300 sheep.</p>

<p>(<i>Oct. 9th</i>) I had written nothing since my hand was dislocated;
here I wrote a little, on Sunday the 14th of the month.<a name="FNanchor_1506" id="FNanchor_1506"></a><a href="#Footnote_1506" class="fnanchor">1506</a></p>

<p>(<i>Oct. 10th</i>) Next day came Afghān chiefs leading the Khirilchī
[and] Samū-khail. The Dilazāk Afghāns entreated pardon for
them; we gave it and set the captured free, fixed their tribute
at 4000 sheep, gave coats (<i>tūn</i>) to their chiefs, appointed and
sent out collectors.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span></p>
<p>(<i>Oct. 13th</i>) These matters settled, we marched on Thursday
the 18th, and dismounted at Bahār (Vihāra?) and Mīch-grām.</p>

<p>(<i>Oct. 14th</i>) Next day I went to the Bāgh-i-wafā. Those were
the days of the garden’s beauty; its lawns were one sheet of
trefoil; its pomegranate-trees yellowed to autumn splendour,<a name="FNanchor_1507" id="FNanchor_1507"></a><a href="#Footnote_1507" class="fnanchor">1507</a>
their fruit full red; fruit on the orange-trees green and glad
(<i>khurram</i>), countless oranges but not yet as yellow as our hearts
desired! The pomegranates were excellent, not equal, however,
to the best ones of Wilāyat.<a name="FNanchor_1508" id="FNanchor_1508"></a><a href="#Footnote_1508" class="fnanchor">1508</a> The one excellent and blessed
content we have had from the Bāgh-i-wafā was had at this time.
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;245b.</span>We were there three or four days; during the time the whole
camp had pomegranates in abundance.</p>

<p>(<i>Oct. 17th</i>) We marched from the garden on Monday. I stayed
in it till the first watch (9 a.m.) and gave away oranges; I bestowed
the fruit of two trees on Shāh Ḥasan; to several begs I gave the
fruit of one tree each; to some gave one tree for two persons.
As we were thinking of visiting Lamghān in the winter, I ordered
that they should reserve (<i>qūrūghlāīlār</i>) at least 20 of the trees
growing round the reservoir. That day we dismounted at
Gandamak.</p>

<p>(<i>Oct. 18th</i>) Next day we dismounted at Jagdālīk. Near the
Evening Prayer there was a wine-party at which most of the
household were present. After a time Qāsim Beg’s sister’s son
Gadāī <i>bihjat</i><a name="FNanchor_1509" id="FNanchor_1509"></a><a href="#Footnote_1509" class="fnanchor">1509</a> used very disturbing words and, being drunk, slid
down on the cushion by my side, so Gadāī T̤aghāī picked him
up and carried him out from the party.</p>

<p>(<i>Oct. 19th</i>) Marching next day from that ground, I made an
excursion up the valley-bottom of the Bārīk-āb towards Qūrūq-sāī.
A few purslain trees were in the utmost autumn beauty.
On dismounting, seasonable<a name="FNanchor_1510" id="FNanchor_1510"></a><a href="#Footnote_1510" class="fnanchor">1510</a> food was set out. The vintage
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>was the cause! wine was drunk! A sheep was ordered brought
from the road and made into <i>kabābs</i> (<i>brochettes</i>). We amused
ourselves by setting fire to branches of holm-oak.<a name="FNanchor_1511" id="FNanchor_1511"></a><a href="#Footnote_1511" class="fnanchor">1511</a></p>

<p>Mullā ‘Abdu’l-malik <i>dīwāna</i><a name="FNanchor_1512" id="FNanchor_1512"></a><a href="#Footnote_1512" class="fnanchor">1512</a> having begged to take the news
of our coming into Kābul, was sent ahead. To this place came
Ḥasan Nabīra from Mīrzā Khān’s presence; he must have come
after letting me know [his intention of coming].<a name="FNanchor_1513" id="FNanchor_1513"></a><a href="#Footnote_1513" class="fnanchor">1513</a> There was<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;246.</span>
drinking till the Sun’s decline; we then rode off. People in our
party had become very drunk, Sayyid Qāsim so much so, that
two of his servants mounted him and got him into camp with
difficulty. Muḥ. Bāqir’s Dost was so drunk that people, headed
by Amīn-i-muḥammad Tarkhān and Mastī <i>chuhra</i>, could not get
him on his horse; even when they poured water on his head,
nothing was effected. At that moment a body of Afghāns
appeared. Amīn-i-muḥammad, who had had enough himself,
had this idea, “Rather than leave him here, as he is, to be taken,
let us cut his head off and carry it with us.” At last after 100
efforts, they mounted him and brought him with them. We
reached Kābul at midnight.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>ff. Incidents in Kābul.</i>)</p>

<p>In Court next morning Qulī Beg waited on me. He had
been to Sl. Sa’īd Khān’s presence in Kāshghar as my envoy.
To him as envoy to me had been added Bīshka Mīrzā <i>Itārchī</i><a name="FNanchor_1514" id="FNanchor_1514"></a><a href="#Footnote_1514" class="fnanchor">1514</a>
who brought me gifts of the goods of that country.</p>

<p>(<i>Oct. 25th</i>) On Wednesday the 1st of Ẕū’l-qa‘da, I went by
myself to Qābil’s tomb<a name="FNanchor_1515" id="FNanchor_1515"></a><a href="#Footnote_1515" class="fnanchor">1515</a> and there took my morning. The
people of the party came later by ones and twos. When the
Sun waxed hot, we went to the Violet-garden and drank there,
by the side of the reservoir. Mid-day coming on, we slept. At
the Mid-day Prayer we drank again. At this mid-day party
I gave wine to Tīngrī-qulī Beg and to Mahndī (?) to whom at
any earlier party, wine had not been given. At the Bed-time<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;246b.</span>
Prayer, I went to the Hot-bath where I stayed the night.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span></p><p>(<i>Oct. 26th</i>) On Thursday honorary dresses were bestowed on
the Hindūstānī traders, headed by Yaḥya <i>Nūḥānī</i>, and they
were allowed to go.</p>

<p>(<i>Oct. 28th</i>) On Saturday the 4th, a dress and gifts were
bestowed on Bīshka Mīrzā, who had come from Kāshghar, and
he was given leave to go.</p>

<p>(<i>Oct. 29th</i>) On Sunday there was a party in the little Picture-hall
over the (Chār-bāgh) gate; small retreat though it is,
16 persons were present.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>gg. Excursion to the Koh-dāman.</i>)</p>

<p>(<i>Oct. 30th</i>) Today we went to Istālīf to see the harvest (<i>khizān</i>).
Today was done the sin (? <i>irtikāb qīlīb aīdī</i>) of <i>ma’jūn</i>. Much
rain fell; most of the begs and the household came into my tent,
outside the Bāgh-i-kalān.</p>

<p>(<i>Oct. 31st</i>) Next day there was a wine-party in the same
garden, lasting till night.</p>

<p>(<i>November 1st</i>) At dawn we took our morning (<i>ṣubāḥī ṣubūḥī
qīldūk</i>) and got drunk, took a sleep, and at the Mid-day Prayer
rode from Istālīf. On the road a confection was eaten. We
reached Bih-zādī at the Other Prayer. The harvest-crops were
very beautiful; while we were viewing them those disposed
for wine began to agitate about it. The harvest-colour was
extremely beautiful; wine was drunk, though <i>ma’jūn</i> had been
eaten, sitting under autumnal trees. The party lasted till the
Bed-time Prayer. Khalīfa’s Mullā Maḥmūd arriving, we had
him summoned to join the party. ‘Abdu’l-lāh was very drunk
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;247.</span>indeed; a word affecting Khalīfa (<i>t̤arfidīn</i>) being said, ‘Abdu’l-lāh

<p>Mullā Maḥmūd was sober; he blamed ‘Abdu’l-lāh for repeating
that line in jest; ‘Abdu’l-lāh came to his senses, was troubled in
mind, and after this talked and chatted very sweetly.</p>

<p>Our excursion to view the harvest was over; we dismounted,
close to the Evening Prayer, in the Chār-bāgh.</p>

<p>(<i>Nov. 12th</i>) On Friday the 16th, after eating a confection
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
with a few special people in the Violet-garden, we went on
a boat. Humāyūn and Kāmrān were with us later; Humāyūn
made a very good shot at a duck.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>hh. A Bohemian episode.</i>)</p>

<p>(<i>Nov. 14th</i>) On Saturday the 18th, I rode out of the Chār-bāgh
at midnight, sent night-watch and groom back, crossed Mullā
Bābā’s bridge, got out by the Dīūrīn-narrows, round by the
bāzārs and <i>kārez</i> of Qūsh-nādur (var.), along the back of the
Bear-house (<i>khirs-khāna</i>), and near sunrise reached Tardī Beg
<i>Khāk-sār’s<a name="FNanchor_1517" id="FNanchor_1517"></a><a href="#Footnote_1517" class="fnanchor">1517</a> kārez</i>. He ran out quickly on hearing of me. His
shortness (<i>qālāshlīghī</i>) was known; I had taken 100 <i>shāhrukhīs</i>
(&pound;5) with me; I gave him these and told him to get wine and
other things ready as I had a fancy for a private and unrestrained
party. He went for wine towards Bih-zādī<a name="FNanchor_1518" id="FNanchor_1518"></a><a href="#Footnote_1518" class="fnanchor">1518</a>; I sent my horse
by his slave to the valley-bottom and sat down on the slope
behind the <i>kārez</i>. At the first watch (9 a.m.) Tardī Beg brought<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;247b.</span>
a pitcher of wine which we drank by turns. After him came
Muḥammad-i-qāsim <i>Barlās</i> and Shāh-zāda who had got to know
of his fetching the wine, and had followed him, their minds
quite empty of any thought about me. We invited them to the
party. Said Tardī Beg, “Hul-hul Anīga wishes to drink wine
with you.” Said I, “For my part, I never saw a woman drink
wine; invite her.” We also invited Shāhī a qalandar, and one
of the <i>kārez</i>-men who played the rebeck. There was drinking
till the Evening Prayer on the rising-ground behind the <i>kārez</i>;
we then went into Tardī Beg’s house and drank by lamp-light
almost till the Bed-time Prayer. The party was quite free and
unpretending. I lay down, the others went to another house
and drank there till beat of drum (midnight). Hul-hul Anīga
came in and made me much disturbance; I got rid of her at last
by flinging myself down as if drunk. It was in my mind to put
people off their guard, and ride off alone to Astar-ghach, but it
did not come off because they got to know. In the end, I rode
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>away at beat of drum, after letting Tardī Beg and Shāh-zāda
know. We three mounted and made for Astar-ghach.</p>

<p>(<i>Nov. 15th</i>) We reached Khwāja Ḥasan below Istālīf by the
first prayer (<i>farẓ waqt</i>); dismounted for a while, ate a confection,
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;248.</span>and went to view the harvest. When the Sun was up, we
dismounted at a garden in Istālīf and ate grapes. We slept
at Khwāja Shahāb, a dependency of Astar-ghach. Ātā, the
Master of the Horse, must have had a house somewhere near,
for before we were awake he had brought food and a pitcher of
wine. The vintage was very fine. After drinking a few cups,
we rode on. We next dismounted in a garden beautiful with
autumn; there a party was held at which Khwāja Muḥammad
Amīn joined us. Drinking went on till the Bed-time Prayer.
During that day and night ‘Abdu’l-lāh, ‘Asas, Nūr Beg and
Yūsuf-i-‘alī all arrived from Kābul.</p>

<p>(<i>Nov. 16th</i>) After food at dawn, we rode out and visited the
Bāgh-i-pādshāhī below Astar-ghach. One young apple-tree in
it had turned an admirable autumn-colour; on each branch were
left 5 or 6 leaves in regular array; it was such that no painter
trying to depict it could have equalled. After riding from
Astar-ghach we ate at Khwāja Ḥasan, and reached Bih-zādī at
the Evening Prayer. There we drank in the house of Khwāja
Muḥ. Amīn’s servant Imām-i-muḥammad.</p>

<p>(<i>Nov. 17th</i>) Next day, Tuesday, we went into the Chār-bāgh
of Kābul.</p>

<p>(<i>Nov. 18th</i>) On Thursday the 23rd, having marched (<i>kūchūb</i>),
the fort was entered.</p>

<p>(<i>Nov. 19th</i>) On Friday Muḥammad ‘Alī (son of ?) Ḥaidar
the stirrup-holder brought, as an offering, a <i>tūīgūn</i><a name="FNanchor_1519" id="FNanchor_1519"></a><a href="#Footnote_1519" class="fnanchor">1519</a> he had
caught.</p>

<p>(<i>Nov. 20th</i>) On Saturday the 25th, there was a party in the
Plane-tree garden from which I rose and mounted at the Bed-time
Prayer. Sayyid Qāsim being in shame at past occurrences,<a name="FNanchor_1520" id="FNanchor_1520"></a><a href="#Footnote_1520" class="fnanchor">1520</a>
we dismounted at his house and drank a few cups.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;248b.</span>(<i>Nov. 24th</i>) On Thursday the 1st of Ẕū’l-ḥijja, Tāju’d-dīn

<p>(<i>Dec. 12th</i>) On Monday the 19th, Muḥ. ‘Alī <i>Jang-jang</i> came

<p>(<i>Dec. 13th</i>) On Tuesday the ... of the month, Sangar Khān
<i>Janjūha</i>, come from Bhīra, waited on me.</p>

<p>(<i>Dec. 16th</i>) On Friday the 23rd, I finished (copying?) the odes
and couplets selected according to their measure from ‘Alī-sher
Beg’s four Dīwāns.<a name="FNanchor_1521" id="FNanchor_1521"></a><a href="#Footnote_1521" class="fnanchor">1521</a></p>

<p>(<i>Dec. 20th</i>) On Tuesday the 27th there was a social-gathering
in the citadel, at which it was ordered that if any-one went out
from it drunk, that person should not be invited to a party again.</p>

<p>(<i>Dec. 23rd</i>) On Friday the 30th of Ẕū’l-ḥijja it was ridden
out with the intention of making an excursion to Lamghān.</p>

<p>(<i>Dec. 23rd</i>) On Saturday Muḥarram 1st Khwāja Sih-yārān
was reached. A wine-party was had on the bank of the conduit,
where this comes out on the hill.<a name="FNanchor_1523" id="FNanchor_1523"></a><a href="#Footnote_1523" class="fnanchor">1523</a></p>

<p>(<i>Dec. 24th</i>) Riding on next morning (2nd), we visited the

<p>(<i>Dec. 25th</i>) Riding on from there, we ate a confection (<i>ma’jūn</i>),
went further and dismounted at Bilkir (?).</p>

<p>(<i>Dec. 26th</i>) At dawn (4th) we made our morning [<i>ṣubāḥī
ṣubūḥī qīldūk</i>], although there might be drinking at night. We
rode on at the Mid-day Prayer, dismounted at Dūr-nāma<a name="FNanchor_1525" id="FNanchor_1525"></a><a href="#Footnote_1525" class="fnanchor">1525</a> and
there had a wine party.</p>

<p>(<i>Dec. 27th</i>) We took our morning early. Ḥaq-dād, the
headman of Dūr-namā made me an offering (<i>pesh-kash</i>) of his
garden.</p>

<p>(<i>Dec. 28th</i>) Riding thence on Thursday (6th), we dismounted
at the villages of the Tājiks in Nijr-aū.</p>

<p>(<i>Dec. 29th</i>) On Friday (7th) we hunted the hill between Forty-ploughs
(<i>Chihil-qulba</i>) and the water of Bārān; many deer fell.
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;249.</span>I had not shot an arrow since my hand was hurt; now, with an
easy<a name="FNanchor_1526" id="FNanchor_1526"></a><a href="#Footnote_1526" class="fnanchor">1526</a> bow, I shot a deer in the shoulder, the arrow going in to
half up the feather. Returning from hunting, we went on at
the Other Prayer in Nijr-aū.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span></p>
<p>(<i>Dec. 30th</i>) Next day (Saturday 8th) the tribute of the

We went on and dismounted in Badr-aū (Tag-aū).</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>b. Excursions in Lamghān.</i>)</p>

<p>(<i>Jan. ...</i>) Riding on, we dismounted at Aūlūgh-nūr.<a name="FNanchor_1529" id="FNanchor_1529"></a><a href="#Footnote_1529" class="fnanchor">1529</a> The
fishermen there took fish at one draught<a name="FNanchor_1530" id="FNanchor_1530"></a><a href="#Footnote_1530" class="fnanchor">1530</a> from the water of
Bārān. At the Other Prayer (afternoon) there was drinking on
the raft; and there was drinking in a tent after we left the raft
at the Evening Prayer.</p>

<p>Ḥaidar the standard-bearer had been sent from Dāwar<a name="FNanchor_1531" id="FNanchor_1531"></a><a href="#Footnote_1531" class="fnanchor">1531</a> to
the Kāfirs; several Kāfir headmen came now to the foot of
Bād-i-pīch (pass), brought a few goat-skins of wine, and did
obeisance. In descending that pass a surprising number of
...<a name="FNanchor_1532" id="FNanchor_1532"></a><a href="#Footnote_1532" class="fnanchor">1532</a> was seen.</p>

<p>(<i>Jan. ...</i>) Next day getting on a raft, we ate a confection,
got off below Būlān and went to camp. There were two rafts.</p>

<p>(<i>Jan. 5th</i>) Marching on Friday (14th), we dismounted below
Mandrāwar on the hill-skirt. There was a late wine-party.</p>

<p>(<i>Jan. 6th</i>) On Saturday (15th), we passed through the Darūta
narrows by raft, got off a little above Jahān-namā’ī (Jalālābād)
and went to the Bāgh-i-wafā in front of Adīnapūr. When we
were leaving the raft the governor of Nīngnahār Qayyām Aūrdū
Shāh came and did obeisance. Langar Khān <i>Nīā-zāī</i>,&mdash;he had<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;249b.</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>been in Nīl-āb for a time,&mdash;waited upon me on the road. We
dismounted in the Bāgh-i-wafā; its oranges had yellowed
beautifully; its spring-bloom was well-advanced, and it was very
charming. We stayed in it five or six days.</p>

<p>As it was my wish and inclination (<i>jū dagh-dagha</i>)to return
to obedience (<i>tā’ib</i>) in my 40th year, I was drinking to excess
now that less than a year was left.</p>

<p>(<i>Jan. 7th</i>) On Sunday the 16th, having made my morning
(<i>ṣubūḥī</i>) and became sober. Mullā Yārak played an air he had
composed in five-time and in the five-line measure (<i>makhammas</i>),
while I chose to eat a confection (<i>ma’jūn</i>). He had composed
an excellent air. I had not occupied myself with such things
for some time; a wish to compose came over me now, so
I composed an air in four-time, as will be mentioned in time.<a name="FNanchor_1533" id="FNanchor_1533"></a><a href="#Footnote_1533" class="fnanchor">1533</a></p>

<p>(<i>Jan. 10th</i>) On Wednesday (19th) it was said for fun, while
we were making our morning (<i>ṣubūḥī</i>), “Let whoever speaks
like a Sārt (<i>i.e.</i> in Persian) drink a cup.” Through this many
drank. At <i>sunnat-waqt</i><a name="FNanchor_1534" id="FNanchor_1534"></a><a href="#Footnote_1534" class="fnanchor">1534</a> again, when we were sitting under the
willows in the middle of the meadow, it was said, “Let whoever
speaks like a Turk, drink a cup!” Through this also numbers
drank. After the sun got up, we drank under the orange-trees
on the reservoir-bank.</p>

<p>(<i>Jan. 11th</i>) Next day (20th) we got on a raft from Darūta;
got off again below Jūī-shāhī and went to Atar.</p>

<p>(<i>Jan....</i>) We rode from there to visit Nūr-valley, went as
far as Sūsān (lily)-village, then turned back and dismounted
in Amla.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;250.</span>(<i>Jan. 14th</i>) As Khwāja Kalān had brought Bajaur into good
order, and as he was a friend of mine, I had sent for him and
had made Bajaur over to Shāh Mīr Ḥusain’s charge. On
Saturday the 22nd of the month (Muḥarram), Shāh Mīr Ḥusain
was given leave to go. That day in Amla we drank.</p>

<p>(<i>Jan. 15th</i>) It rained (<i>yāmghūr yāghdūrūb</i>) next day (23rd).</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span></p><p>When we reached Kula-grām in Kūnār<a name="FNanchor_1535" id="FNanchor_1535"></a><a href="#Footnote_1535" class="fnanchor">1535</a> where Malik ‘Alī’s
house is, we dismounted at his middle son’s house, overlooking
an orange-orchard. We did not go into the orchard because of
the rain but just drank where we were. The rain was very
heavy. I taught Mullā ‘Alī Khān a t̤alisman I knew; he wrote
it on four pieces of paper and hung them on four sides; as he
did it, the rain stopped and the air began to clear.</p>

<p>(<i>Jan. 16th</i>) At dawn (24th) we got on a raft; on another
several braves went. People in Bajaur, Sawād, Kūnār and
thereabouts make a beer (<i>bīr būza</i>)<a name="FNanchor_1536" id="FNanchor_1536"></a><a href="#Footnote_1536" class="fnanchor">1536</a> the ferment of which is
a thing they call <i>kīm</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1537" id="FNanchor_1537"></a><a href="#Footnote_1537" class="fnanchor">1537</a> This <i>kīm</i> they make of the roots of
herbs and several simples, shaped like a loaf, dried and kept by
them. Some sorts of beer are surprisingly exhilarating, but
bitter and distasteful. We had thought of drinking beer but,
because of its bitter taste, preferred a confection. ‘Asas, Ḥasan
<i>Aīkirik</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1538" id="FNanchor_1538"></a><a href="#Footnote_1538" class="fnanchor">1538</a> and Mastī, on the other raft, were ordered to drink
some; they did so and became quite drunk. Ḥasan <i>Aīkirik</i>
set up a disgusting disturbance; ‘Asas, very drunk, did such<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;250b.</span>
unpleasant things that we were most uncomfortable (<i>ba tang</i>).
I thought of having them put off on the far side of the water,
but some of the others begged them off.</p>

<p>I had sent for Khwāja Kalān at this time and had bestowed
Bajaur on Shāh Mīr Ḥusain. For why? Khwāja Kalān was
a friend; his stay in Bajaur had been long; moreover the Bajaur
appointment appeared an easy one.</p>

<p>At the ford of the Kūnār-water Shāh Mīr Ḥusain met me on
his way to Bajaur. I sent for him and said a few trenchant
words, gave him some special armour, and let him go.</p>

<p>Opposite Nūr-gal (Rock-village) an old man begged from
those on the rafts; every-one gave him something, coat (<i>tūn</i>),
turban, bathing-cloth and so on, so he took a good deal away.</p>

<p>At a bad place in mid-stream the raft struck with a great
shock; there was much alarm; it did not sink but Mīr Muḥammad
the raftsman was thrown into the water. We were near Atar
that night.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span></p>
<p>(<i>Jan. 17th</i>) On Tuesday (25th) we reached Mandrāwar.<a name="FNanchor_1539" id="FNanchor_1539"></a><a href="#Footnote_1539" class="fnanchor">1539</a>
Qūtlūq-qadam and his father had arranged a party inside the
fort; though the place had no charm, a few cups were drunk
there to please them. We went to camp at the Other Prayer.</p>

<p>(<i>Jan. 18th</i>) On Wednesday (26th) an excursion was made to
Kind-kir<a name="FNanchor_1540" id="FNanchor_1540"></a><a href="#Footnote_1540" class="fnanchor">1540</a> spring. Kind-kir is a dependent village of the
Mandrāwar <i>tūmān</i>, the one and only village of the Lamghānāt
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;251.</span>where dates are grown. It lies rather high on the mountain-skirt,
its date lands on its east side. At one edge of the date
lands is the spring, in a place aside (<i>yān yīr</i>). Six or seven
yards below the spring-head people have heaped up stones to
make a shelter<a name="FNanchor_1541" id="FNanchor_1541"></a><a href="#Footnote_1541" class="fnanchor">1541</a> for bathing and by so-doing have raised the
water in the reservoir high enough for it to pour over the heads
of the bathers. The water is very soft; it is felt a little cold in
wintry days but is pleasant if one stays in it.</p>

<p>(<i>Jan. 19th</i>) On Thursday (27th) Sher Khān <i>Tarkalānī</i> got us
to dismount at his house and there gave us a feast (<i>ẓiyāfat</i>).
Having ridden on at the Mid-day Prayer, fish were taken out of
the fish-ponds of which particulars have been given.<a name="FNanchor_1542" id="FNanchor_1542"></a><a href="#Footnote_1542" class="fnanchor">1542</a></p>

<p>(<i>Jan. 20th</i>) On Friday (28th) we dismounted near Khwāja
Mīr-i-mīrān’s village. A party was held there at the Evening
Prayer.</p>

<p>(<i>Jan. 21st</i>) On Saturday (29th) we hunted the hill between
‘Alī-shang and Alangār. One hunting-circle having been made
on the ‘Alī-shang side, another on the Alangār, the deer were
driven down off the hill and many were killed. Returning from
hunting, we dismounted in a garden belonging to the Maliks of
Alangār and there had a party.</p>

<p>Half of one of my front-teeth had broken off, the other half
remaining; this half broke off today while I was eating food.</p>

<p>(<i>Jan. 22nd</i>) At dawn (Ṣafar 1st) we rode out and had a fishing-net
cast, at mid-day went into ‘Alī-shang and drank in a garden.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span></p>
<p>(<i>Jan. 23rd</i>) Next day (Ṣafar 2nd) Ḥamza Khān, Malik of
‘Alī-shang was made over to the avengers-of-blood<a name="FNanchor_1543" id="FNanchor_1543"></a><a href="#Footnote_1543" class="fnanchor">1543</a> for his evil
deeds in shedding innocent blood, and retaliation was made.</p>

<p>(<i>Jan. 24th</i>) On Tuesday, after reading a chapter of the Qorān<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;251b.</span>
(<i>wird</i>), we turned for Kābul by the Yān-būlāgh road. At the
Other Prayer, we passed the [Bārān]-water from Aūlūgh-nūr
(Great-rock); reached Qarā-tū by the Evening Prayer, there
gave our horses corn and had a hasty meal prepared, rode on
again as soon as they had finished their barley.<a name="FNanchor_1544" id="FNanchor_1544"></a><a href="#Footnote_1544" class="fnanchor">1544</a></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">TRANSLATOR’S NOTE ON 926 to 932 AH.-1520 to 1525 AD.</span></p>

<p>Bābur’s diary breaks off here for five years and ten months.<a name="FNanchor_1545" id="FNanchor_1545"></a><a href="#Footnote_1545" class="fnanchor">1545</a>
His activities during the unrecorded period may well have left
no time in which to keep one up, for in it he went thrice to
Qandahār, thrice into India, once to Badakhshān, once to Balkh;
twice at least he punished refractory tribesmen; he received
embassies from Hindūstān, and must have had much to oversee
in muster and equipment for his numerous expeditions. Over
and above this, he produced the <i>Mubīn</i>, a Turkī poem of 2000
lines.</p>

<p>That the gap in his autobiography is not intentional several
passages in his writings show;<a name="FNanchor_1546" id="FNanchor_1546"></a><a href="#Footnote_1546" class="fnanchor">1546</a> he meant to fill it; there is no
evidence that he ever did so; the reasonable explanation of his
failure is that he died before he had reached this part of his book.</p>

<p>The events of these unrecorded years are less interesting than
those of the preceding gap, inasmuch as their drama of human
passion is simpler; it is one mainly of cross-currents of ambition,
nothing in it matching the maelstrom of sectarian hate, tribal
antipathy, and racial struggle which engulphed Bābur’s fortunes
beyond the Oxus.</p>

<p>None-the-less the period has its distinctive mark, the biographical
one set by his personality as his long-sustained effort
works out towards rule in Hindūstān. He becomes felt; his
surroundings bend to his purpose; his composite following
accepts his goal; he gains the southern key of Kābul and
Hindūstān and presses the Arghūns out from his rear; in the
Panj-āb he becomes a power; the Rājpūt Rānā of Chitor proffers
him alliance against Ibrāhīm; and his intervention is sought in
those warrings of the Afghāns which were the matrix of his own
success.</p>

<h3><i>EVENTS OF THE UNCHRONICLED YEARS</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">926 AH.-DEC. 23rd 1519 to DEC. 12th 1520 AD.</span></p>

<p>The question of which were Bābur’s “Five expeditions” into
Hindūstān has been often discussed; it is useful therefore to
establish the dates of those known as made. I have entered
one as made in this year for the following reasons;&mdash;it broke
short because Shāh Beg made incursion into Bābur’s territories,
and that incursion was followed by a siege of Qandahār which
several matters mentioned below show to have taken place in
926 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span></span></p>

<p class="indent"><i>a. Expedition into Hindūstān.</i></p>

<p>The march out from Kābul may have been as soon as muster
and equipment allowed after the return from Lamghān chronicled
in the diary. It was made through Bajaur where refractory
tribesmen were brought to order. The Indus will have been
forded at the usual place where, until the last one of 932 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>
(1525 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>), all expeditions crossed on the outward march. Bhīra
was traversed in which were Bābur’s own Commanders, and
advance was made, beyond lands yet occupied, to Sīālkot,
72 miles north of Lāhor and in the Rechna <i>dū-āb</i>. It was
occupied without resistance; and a further move made to what the
MSS. call Sayyidpūr; this attempted defence, was taken by
assault and put to the sword. No place named Sayyidpūr is
given in the Gazetteer of India, but the <i>Āyīn-i-akbarī</i> mentions
a Sidhpūr which from its neighbourhood to Sīālkot may be what
Bābur took.</p>

<p>Nothing indicates an intention in Bābur to join battle with
Ibrāhīm at this time; Lāhor may have been his objective, after
he had made a demonstration in force to strengthen his footing
in Bhīra. Whatever he may have planned to do beyond
Sidhpūr(?) was frustrated by the news which took him back to
Kābul and thence to Qandahār, that an incursion into his
territory had been made by Shāh Beg.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>b. Shāh Shujā‘ Beg’s position.</i></p>

<p>Shāh Beg was now holding Qandahār, Shāl, Mustang and
Sīwīstān.<a name="FNanchor_1550" id="FNanchor_1550"></a><a href="#Footnote_1550" class="fnanchor">1550</a> He knew that he held Qandahār by uncertain
tenure, in face of its desirability for Bābur and his own lesser
power. His ground was further weakened by its usefulness for
operations on Harāt and the presence with Bābur of Bāī-qarā
refugees, ready to seize a chance, if offered by Ismā‘īl’s waning
fortunes, for recovery of their former seat. Knowing his weakness,
he for several years had been pushing his way out into
Sind by way of the Bolān-pass.</p>

<p>His relations with Bābur were ostensibly good; he had sent
him envoys twice last year, the first time to announce a success
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>at Kāhān had in the end of 924 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (Nov. 1519 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>). His son
Ḥasan however, with whom he was unreconciled, had been for
more than a year in Bābur’s company,&mdash;a matter not unlikely to
stir under-currents of unfriendliness on either side.</p>

<p>His relations with Shāh Ismā‘īl were deferential, in appearance
even vassal-like, as is shewn by Khwānd-amīr’s account of his
appeal for intervention against Bābur to the Shāh’s officers
in Harāt. Whether he read the <i>khut̤ba</i> for any suzerain is
doubtful; his son Ḥasan, it may be said, read it later on for
Bābur.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>c. The impelling cause of this siege of Qandahār.</i></p>

<p>Precisely what Shāh Beg did to bring Bābur back from the
Panj-āb and down upon Qandahār is not found mentioned by
any source. It seems likely to have been an affair of subordinates
instigated by or for him. Its immediate agents may have been
the Nīkdīrī (Nūkdīrī) and Hazāra tribes Bābur punished on his
way south. Their location was the western border-land; they
may have descended on the Great North Road or have raided
for food in that famine year. It seems certain that Shāh Beg
made no serious attempt on Kābul; he was too much occupied
in Sind to allow him to do so. Some unused source may throw
light on the matter incidentally; the offence may have been
small in itself and yet sufficient to determine Bābur to remove
risk from his rear.<a name="FNanchor_1551" id="FNanchor_1551"></a><a href="#Footnote_1551" class="fnanchor">1551</a></p>

<p class="indent"><i>d. Qandahār.</i></p>

<p>The Qandahār of Bābur’s sieges was difficult of capture; he
had not taken it in 913 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (f. 208<i>b</i>) by siege or assault, but by
default after one day’s fight in the open. The strength of its
position can be judged from the following account of its ruins
as they were seen in 1879 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>, the military details of which
supplement Bellew’s description quoted in Appendix J.</p>

<p>The fortifications are of great extent with a treble line of
bastioned walls and a high citadel in the centre. The place is
in complete ruin and its locality now useful only as a grazing
ground.... “The town is in three parts, each on a separate
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>eminence, and capable of mutual defence. The mountain had
been covered with towers united by curtains, and the one on the
culminating point may be called impregnable. It commanded
the citadel which stood lower down on the second eminence, and
this in turn commanded the town which was on a table-land
elevated above the plain. The triple walls surrounding the city
were at a considerable distance from it. After exploring the
citadel and ruins, we mounted by the gorge to the summit of
the hill with the impregnable fort. In this gorge are the ruins
of two tanks, some 80 feet square, all destroyed, with the pillars
fallen; the work is <i>pukka</i> in brick and <i>chunām</i> (cement) and
each tank had been domed in; they would have held about
400,000 gallons each.” (Le Messurier’s <i>Kandahar in 1879 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span></i>
pp. 223, 245.)</p>

<p class="indent"><i>e. Bābur’s sieges of Qandahār.</i></p>

<p>The term of five years is found associated with Bābur’s sieges
of Qandahār, sometimes suggesting a single attempt of five years’
duration. This it is easy to show incorrect; its root may be
Mīr Ma‘ṣūm’s erroneous chronology.</p>

<p>The day on which the keys of Qandahār were made over to
Bābur is known, from the famous inscription which commemorates
the event (Appendix J), as Shawwāl 13th 928 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>
Working backwards from this, it is known that in 927 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> terms
of surrender were made and that Bābur went back to Kābul;
he is besieging it in 926 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>&mdash;the year under description; his
annals of 925 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> are complete and contain no siege; the year
924 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> appears to have had no siege, Shāh Beg was on the
Indus and his son was for at least part of it with Bābur; 923 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>
was a year of intended siege, frustrated by Bābur’s own illness;
of any siege in 922 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> there is as yet no record known. So
that it is certain there was no unremitted beleaguerment through
five years.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>f. The siege of 926 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (1520 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>).</i></p>

<p>When Bābur sat down to lay regular siege to Qandahār, with
mining and battering of the walls,<a name="FNanchor_1552" id="FNanchor_1552"></a><a href="#Footnote_1552" class="fnanchor">1552</a> famine was desolating the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>country round. The garrison was reduced to great distress;
“pestilence,” ever an ally of Qandahār, broke out within the
walls, spread to Bābur’s camp, and in the month of Tīr (June)
led him to return to Kābul.</p>

<p>In the succeeding months of respite, Shāh Beg pushed on in
Sind and his former slave, now commander, Mehtar Saṃbhal
revictualled the town.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">927 AH.&mdash;DEC. 12th 1520 to DEC. 1st 1521 AD.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><i>a. The manuscript sources.</i></p>

<p>Two accounts of the sieges of Qandahār in this and next year
are available, one in Khwānd-amīr’s <i>Ḥabību’s-siyar</i>, the other in
Ma‘ṣūm <i>Bhakkarī’s Tārīkh-i-sind</i>. As they have important
differences, it is necessary to consider the opportunities of their
authors for information.</p>

<p>Khwānd-amīr finished his history in 1524-29 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span> His account
of these affairs of Qandahār is contemporary; he was in close
touch with several of the actors in them and may have been in
Harāt through their course; one of his patrons, Amīr Ghiyās̤u’d-dīn,
was put to death in this year in Harāt because of suspicion
that he was an ally of Bābur; his nephew, another Ghiyās̤u’d-dīn
was in Qandahār, the bearer next year of its keys to Bābur;
moreover he was with Bābur himself a few years later in
Hindūstān.</p>

<p>Mīr Ma‘ṣūm wrote in 1600 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span> 70 to 75 years after Khwānd-amīr.
Of these sieges he tells what may have been traditional
and mentions no manuscript authorities. Blochmann’s biography
of him (<i>Āyīn-i-akbarī</i> p. 514) shews his ample opportunity of
learning orally what had happened in the Arghūn invasion of
Sind, but does not mention the opportunity for hearing traditions
about Qandahār which his term of office there allowed him.
During that term it was that he added an inscription, commemorative
of Akbar’s dominion, to Bābur’s own at Chihil-zīna,
which records the date of the capture of Qandahār (928 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1522
<span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>).</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span></p>

<p><i>b. The Ḥabību’s-siyar account</i> (lith. ed. iii, part 4, p. 97).</p>

<p>Khwānd-amīr’s contemporary narrative allows Ma‘ṣūm’s to
dovetail into it as to some matters, but contradicts it in the
important ones of date, and mode of surrender by Shāh Beg to
Bābur. It states that Bābur was resolved in 926 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (1520 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>)
to uproot Shāh Shujā‘ Beg from Qandahār, led an army against
the place, and “opened the Gates of war”. It gives no account
of the siege of 926 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> but passes on to the occurrences of
927 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (1521 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>) when Shāh Beg, unable to meet Bābur in
the field, shut himself up in the town and strengthened the
defences. Bābur put his utmost pressure on the besieged, “often
riding his piebald horse close to the moat and urging his men
to fiery onset.” The garrison resisted manfully, breaching the
“life-fortresses” of the Kābulīs with sword, arrow, spear and
death-dealing stone, but Bābur’s heroes were most often victorious,
and drove their assailants back through the Gates.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>c. Death of Khān Mīrzā reported to Bābur.</i></p>

<p>Meantime, continues Khwānd-amīr, Khān Mīrzā had died in
Badakhshān; the news was brought to Bābur and caused him
great grief; he appointed Humāyūn to succeed the Mīrzā while
he himself prosecuted the siege of Qandahār and the conquest
of the Garm-sīr.<a name="FNanchor_1553" id="FNanchor_1553"></a><a href="#Footnote_1553" class="fnanchor">1553</a></p>

<p class="indent"><i>d. Negociations with Bābur.</i></p>

<p>The Governor of Harāt at this time was Shāh Ismā‘īl’s son
T̤ahmāsp, between six and seven years old. His guardian Amīr
Khān took chief part in the diplomatic intervention with Bābur,
but associated with him was Amīr Ghiyās̤u’d-dīn&mdash;the patron of
Khwānd-amīr already mentioned&mdash;until put to death as an ally
of Bābur. The discussion had with Bābur reveals a complexity
of motives demanding attention. Nominally undertaken though
intervention was on behalf of Shāh Beg, and certainly so at his
request, the Persian officers seem to have been less anxious on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>his account than for their own position in Khurāsān, their master’s
position at the time being weakened by ill-success against the
Sult̤ān of Rūm. To Bābur, Shāh Beg is written of as though he
were an insubordinate vassal whom Bābur was reducing to order
for the Shāh, but when Amīr Khān heard that Shāh Beg was
hard pressed, he was much distressed because he feared a victorious
Bābur might move on Khurāsān. Nothing indicates however
that Bābur had Khurāsān in his thoughts; Hindūstān was his
objective, and Qandahār a help on the way; but as Amīr Khān
had this fear about him, a probable ground for it is provided by
the presence with Bābur of Bāī-qarā exiles whose ambition it
must have been to recover their former seat. Whether for Harāt,
Kābul, or Hindūstān, Qandahār was strength. Another matter
not fitting the avowed purpose of the diplomatic intervention is
the death of Ghiyās̤u’d-dīn because an ally of Bābur; this makes
Amīr Khān seem to count Bābur as Ismā‘īl’s enemy.</p>

<p>Shāh Beg’s requests for intervention began in 926 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (1520 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>),
as also did the remonstrance of the Persian officers with Bābur;
his couriers followed one another with entreaty that the Amīrs
would contrive for Bābur to retire, with promise of obeisance
and of yearly tribute. The Amīrs set forth to Bābur that though
Shāh Shujā‘ Beg had offended and had been deserving of wrath
and chastisement, yet, as he was penitent and had promised
loyalty and tribute, it was now proper for Bābur to raise the siege
(of 926 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>) and go back to Kābul. To this Bābur answered
that Shāh Beg’s promise was a vain thing, on which no reliance
could be placed; please God!, said he, he himself would take
Qandahār and send Shāh Beg a prisoner to Harāt; and that
he should be ready then to give the keys of the town and the
possession of the Garm-sīr to any-one appointed to receive them.</p>

<p>This correspondence suits an assumption that Bābur acted for
Shāh Ismā‘īl, a diplomatic assumption merely, the verbal veil,
on one side, for anxiety lest Bābur or those with him should
attack Harāt,&mdash;on the other, for Bābur’s resolve to hold Qandahār
himself.</p>

<p>Amīr Khān was not satisfied with Bābur’s answer, but had his
attention distracted by another matter, presumably ‘Ubaidu’l-lāh
Khān’s attack on Harāt in the spring of the year (March-April<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
1521 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>). Negociations appear to have been resumed later,
since Khwānd-amīr claims it as their result that Bābur left
Qandahār this year.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>e. The Tārīkh-i-sind account.</i></p>

<p>Mīr Ma‘ṣūm is very brief; he says that in this year (his
922 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>), Bābur went down to Qandahār before the year’s tribute
in grain had been collected, destroyed the standing crops, encompassed
the town, and reduced it to extremity; that Shāh Beg,
wearied under reiterated attack and pre-occupied by operations
in Sind, proposed terms, and that these were made with stipulation
for the town to be his during one year more and then to be given
over to Bābur. These terms settled, Bābur went to Kābul, Shāh
Beg to Sīwī.</p>

<p>The Arghūn families were removed to Shāl and Sīwī, so that
the year’s delay may have been an accommodation allowed for
this purpose.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>f. Concerning dates.</i></p>

<p>There is much discrepancy between the dates of the two
historians. Khwānd-amīr’s agree with the few fixed ones of the
period and with the course of events; several of Ma‘ṣūm’s, on
the contrary, are <i>seriatim</i> five (lunar) years earlier. For instance,
events Khwānd-amīr places under 927 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> Ma‘ṣūm places under
922 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> Again, while Ma‘ṣūm correctly gives 913 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (1507 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>)
as the year of Bābur’s first capture of Qandahār, he sets up a
discrepant series later, from the success Shāh Beg had at Kāhān;
this he allots to 921 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (1515 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>) whereas Bābur received news
of it (f. 233<i>b</i>) in the beginning of 925 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (1519 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>). Again,
Ma‘ṣūm makes Shāh Ḥasan go to Bābur in 921 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> and stay
two years; but Ḥasan spent the whole of 925 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> with Bābur
and is not mentioned as having left before the second month of
926 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> Again, Ma‘ṣūm makes Shāh Beg surrender the keys
of Qandahār in 923 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (1517 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>), but 928 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (1522 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>) is
shewn by Khwānd-amīr’s dates and narrative, and is inscribed
at Chihil-zīna.<a name="FNanchor_1554" id="FNanchor_1554"></a><a href="#Footnote_1554" class="fnanchor">1554</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">928 AH.-DEC. 1st 1521 to NOV. 20th 1522 AD.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><i>a. Bābur visits Badakhshān.</i></p>

<p>Either early in this year or late in the previous one, Bābur and
Māhīm went to visit Humāyūn in his government, probably
to Faizābād, and stayed with him what Gul-badan calls
a few days.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>b. Expedition to Qandahār.</i></p>

<p>This year saw the end of the duel for possession of Qandahār.
Khwānd-amīr’s account of its surrender differs widely from
Ma‘ṣūm’s. It claims that Bābur’s retirement in 927 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> was due
to the remonstrances from Harāt, and that Shāh Beg, worn out
by the siege, relied on the arrangement the Amīrs had made
with Bābur and went to Sīwī, leaving one ‘Abdu’l-bāqī in charge
of the place. This man, says Khwānd-amīr, drew the line of
obliteration over his duty to his master, sent to Bābur, brought
him down to Qandahār, and gave him the keys of the town&mdash;by
the hand of Khwānd-amīr’s nephew Ghiyās̤u’d-dīn, specifies
the <i>Tarkhān-nāma</i>. In this year messengers had come and
gone between Bābur and Harāt; two men employed by Amīr
Khān are mentioned by name; of them the last had not returned
to Harāt when a courier of Bābur’s, bringing a tributary gift,
announced there that the town was in his master’s hands.
Khwānd-amīr thus fixes the year 928 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> as that in which the
town passed into Bābur’s hands; this date is confirmed by the
one inscribed in the monument of victory at Chihil-zīna which
Bābur ordered excavated on the naze of the limestone ridge
behind the town. The date there given is Shawwāl 13th 928 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>
(Sep. 6th 1522 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>).</p>

<p>Ma‘ṣūm’s account, dated 923 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (1517 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>), is of the briefest:&mdash;Shāh
Beg fulfilled his promise, much to Bābur’s approval, by
sending him the keys of the town and royal residence.</p>

<p>Although Khwānd-amīr’s account has good claim to be
accepted, it must be admitted that several circumstances can be
taken to show that Shāh Beg had abandoned Qandahār, <i>e.g.</i> the
removal of the families after Bābur’s retirement last year, and
his own absence in a remote part of Sind this year.</p>

of opinion about the month and close agreement about the day,
Sha‘bān 22nd or 23rd. Ma‘ṣūm gives a chronogram, <i>Shahr-Sha‘bān</i>,
(month of Sha‘bān) which yields 928, but he does not
mention where he obtained it, nor does anything in his narrative
shew what has fixed the day of the month.</p>

<p>Two objections to 928 are patent: (1) the doubt engendered
by Ma‘ṣūm’s earlier ante-dating; (2) that if 928 be right, Shāh
Beg was already dead over two months when Qandahār was
surrendered. This he might have been according to Khwānd-amīr’s
narrative, but if he died on Sha‘bān 22nd 928 (July 26th
1522), there was time for the news to have reached Qandahār,
and to have gone on to Harāt before the surrender. Shāh Beg’s
death at that time could not have failed to be associated in
Khwānd-amīr’s narrative with the fate of Qandahār; it might
have pleaded some excuse with him for ‘Abdu’l-bāqī, who might
even have had orders from Shāh Ḥasan to make the town over
to Bābur whose suzerainty he had acknowledged at once on
succession by reading the <i>khut̤ba</i> in his name. Khwānd-amīr
however does not mention what would have been a salient point
in the events of the siege; his silence cannot but weigh against
the 928 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span></p>

<p>The year 930 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> is given by Niz̤āmu’d-dīn Aḥmad’s <i>T̤abaqāt-i-akbarī</i>
(lith. ed. p. 637), and this year has been adopted by
Erskine, Beale, and Ney Elias, perhaps by others. Some light
on the matter may be obtained incidentally as the sources are
examined for a complete history of India, perhaps coming from
the affairs of Multān, which was attacked by Shāh Ḥasan after
communication with Bābur.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>d. Bābur’s literary work in 928 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> and earlier.</i></p>

<p>1. The <i>Mubīn</i>. This year, as is known from a chronogram
within the work, Bābur wrote the Turkī poem of 2000 lines to
which Abū’l-faẓl and Badāyūnī give the name <i>Mubīn</i> (The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>Exposition), but of which the true title is said by the <i>Nafā’isu’l-ma‘āsir</i>
to be <i>Dar fiqa mubaiyan</i> (The Law expounded). Sprenger
found it called also <i>Fiqa-i-bāburī</i> (Bābur’s Law). It is a versified
and highly orthodox treatise on Muḥammadan Law, written for
the instruction of Kāmrān. A Commentary on it, called also
<i>Mubīn</i>, was written by Shaikh Zain. Bābur quotes from it
(f. 351<i>b</i>) when writing of linear measures. Berézine found and
published a large portion of it as part of his <i>Chrestomathie Turque</i>
(Kazan 1857); the same fragment may be what was published
by Ilminsky. Teufel remarks that the MS. used by Berézine may
have descended direct from one sent by Bābur to a distinguished
legist of Transoxiana, because the last words of Berézine’s imprint
are Bābur’s <i>Begleitschreiben</i> (<i>envoi</i>); he adds the expectation
that the legist’s name might be learned. Perhaps this recipient
was the Khwāja Kalān, son of Khwāja Yaḥya, a Samarkandī to
whom Bābur sent a copy of his Memoirs on March 7th 1520
(935 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> f. 363).<a name="FNanchor_1556" id="FNanchor_1556"></a><a href="#Footnote_1556" class="fnanchor">1556</a></p>

<p>2. The <i>Bābur-nāma</i> diary of 925-6 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (1519-20 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>). This
is almost contemporary with the <i>Mubīn</i> and is the earliest part
of the <i>Bābur-nāma</i> writings now known. It was written about
a decade earlier than the narrative of 899 to 914 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (1494 to
1507 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>), carries later annotations, and has now the character
of a draft awaiting revision.</p>

<p>3. A <i>Dīwān</i> (Collection of poems). By dovetailing a few
fragments of information, it becomes clear that by 925 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>
(1519 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>) Bābur had made a Collection of poetical compositions
distinct from the Rāmpūr <i>Dīwān</i>; it is what he sent to Pūlād
Sult̤an in 925 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (f. 238). Its date excludes the greater part
of the Rāmpūr one. It may have contained those verses to
which my husband drew attention in the Asiatic Quarterly
Review of 1911, as quoted in the <i>Abūshqa</i>; and it may have
contained, in agreement with its earlier date, the verses Bābur
quotes as written in his earlier years. None of the quatrains
found in the <i>Abūshqa</i> and there attributed to “Bābur Mīrzā”,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>are in the Rāmpūr <i>Dīwān</i>; nor are several of those early ones
of the <i>Bābur-nāma</i>. So that the Dīwān sent to Pūlād Sult̤ān
may be the source from which the <i>Abūshqa</i> drew its examples.</p>

<p>On first examining these verses, doubt arose as to whether
they were really by Bābur <i>Mīrānshāhī</i>; or whether they were
by “Bābur Mīrzā” <i>Shāhrukhī</i>. Fortunately my husband lighted
on one of them quoted in the <i>Sanglakh</i> and there attributed to
Bābur Pādshāh. The <i>Abūshqa</i> quatrains are used as examples
in de Courteille’s <i>Dictionary</i>, but without an author’s name; they
can be traced there through my husband’s articles.<a name="FNanchor_1557" id="FNanchor_1557"></a><a href="#Footnote_1557" class="fnanchor">1557</a></p>

<p class="indent"><i>a. Affairs of Hindūstān.</i></p>

<p>The centre of interest in Bābur’s affairs now moves from
Qandahār to a Hindūstān torn by faction, of which faction one
result was an appeal made at this time to Bābur by Daulat Khān
<i>Lūdī</i> (<i>Yūsuf-khail</i>) and ‘Alāu’d-dīn ‘Ālam Khān <i>Lūdī</i> for help
against Ibrāhīm.<a name="FNanchor_1558" id="FNanchor_1558"></a><a href="#Footnote_1558" class="fnanchor">1558</a></p>

<p>The following details are taken mostly from Aḥmad Yādgār’s
<i>Tārīkh-i-salāt̤īn-i-afāghana</i><a name="FNanchor_1559" id="FNanchor_1559"></a><a href="#Footnote_1559" class="fnanchor">1559</a>:&mdash;Daulat Khān had been summoned
to Ibrāhīm’s presence; he had been afraid to go and had sent
his son Dilāwar in his place; his disobedience angering Ibrāhīm,
Dilāwar had a bad reception and was shewn a ghastly exhibit
of disobedient commanders. Fearing a like fate for himself, he
made escape and hastened to report matters to his father in
Lāhor. His information strengthening Daulat Khān’s previous
apprehensions, decided the latter to proffer allegiance to Bābur
and to ask his help against Ibrāhīm. Apparently ‘Ālam Khān’s
interests were a part of this request. Accordingly Dilāwar
(or Apāq) Khān went to Kābul, charged with his father’s
message, and with intent to make known to Bābur Ibrāhīm’s
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>evil disposition, his cruelty and tyranny, with their fruit of
discontent amongst his Commanders and soldiery.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>b. Reception of Dilāwar Khān in Kābul.</i></p>

<p>Wedding festivities were in progress<a name="FNanchor_1560" id="FNanchor_1560"></a><a href="#Footnote_1560" class="fnanchor">1560</a> when Dilāwar Khān
reached Kābul. He presented himself, at the Chār-bāgh may
be inferred, and had word taken to Bābur that an Afghān was
at his Gate with a petition. When admitted, he demeaned
himself as a suppliant and proceeded to set forth the distress of
Hindūstān. Bābur asked why he, whose family had so long
eaten the salt of the Lūdīs, had so suddenly deserted them for
himself. Dilāwar answered that his family through 40 years had
upheld the Lūdī throne, but that Ibrāhīm maltreated Sikandar’s
amīrs, had killed 25 of them without cause, some by hanging
some burned alive, and that there was no hope of safety in him.
Therefore, he said, he had been sent by many amīrs to Bābur
whom they were ready to obey and for whose coming they were
on the anxious watch.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>c. Bābur asks a sign.</i></p>

<p>At the dawn of the day following the feast, Bābur prayed in
the garden for a sign of victory in Hindūstān, asking that it
should be a gift to himself of mango or betel, fruits of that land.
It so happened that Daulat Khān had sent him, as a present,
half-ripened mangoes preserved in honey; when these were set
before him, he accepted them as the sign, and from that time
forth, says the chronicler, made preparation for a move on
Hindūstān.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>d. ‘Ālam Khān.</i></p>

<p>Although ‘Ālam Khān seems to have had some amount of
support for his attempt against his nephew, events show he had
none valid for his purpose. That he had not Daulat Khān’s,
later occurrences make clear. Moreover he seems not to have
been a man to win adherence or to be accepted as a trustworthy
and sensible leader.<a name="FNanchor_1561" id="FNanchor_1561"></a><a href="#Footnote_1561" class="fnanchor">1561</a> Dates are uncertain in the absence of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>Bābur’s narrative, but it may have been in this year that ‘Ālam
Khān went in person to Kābul and there was promised help
against Ibrāhīm.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>e. Birth of Gul-badan.</i></p>

<p>Either in this year or the next was born Dil-dār’s third
daughter Gul-badan, the later author of an <i>Humāyūn-nāma</i>
written at her nephew Akbar’s command in order to provide
information for the <i>Akbar-nāma</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">930 AH.&mdash;NOV. 10th 1523 to OCT. 29th 1524 AD.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><i>a. Bābur’s fourth expedition to Hindūstān.</i></p>

<p>This expedition differs from all earlier ones by its co-operation
with Afghān malcontents against Ibrāhīm <i>Lūdī</i>, and by having
for its declared purpose direct attack on him through reinforcement
of ‘Ālam Khān.</p>

<p>Exactly when the start from Kābul was made is not found
stated; the route taken after fording the Indus, was by the
sub-montane road through the Kakar country; the Jīhlam and
Chīn-āb were crossed and a move was made to within 10 miles
of Lāhor.</p>

<p>Lāhor was Daulat Khān’s head-quarters but he was not in it
now; he had fled for refuge to a colony of Bilūchīs, perhaps
towards Multān, on the approach against him of an army of
Ibrāhīm’s under Bihār Khān <i>Lūdī</i>. A battle ensued between
Bābur and Bihār Khān; the latter was defeated with great
slaughter; Bābur’s troops followed his fugitive men into Lāhor,
plundered the town and burned some of the <i>bāzārs</i>.</p>

<p>Four days were spent near Lāhor, then move south was made
to Dībālpūr which was stormed, plundered and put to the sword.
The date of this capture is known from an incidental remark of
Bābur about chronograms (f. 325), to be mid-Rabī‘u’l-awwal
930 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (<i>circa</i> Jan. 22nd 1524 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>).<a name="FNanchor_1562" id="FNanchor_1562"></a><a href="#Footnote_1562" class="fnanchor">1562</a> From Dībālpūr a start was
made for Sihrind but before this could be reached news arrived
which dictated return to Lāhor.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent"><i>b. The cause of return.</i></p>

<p>Daulat Khān’s action is the obvious cause of the retirement.
He and his sons had not joined Bābur until the latter was
at Dībālpūr; he was not restored to his former place in charge
of the important Lāhor, but was given Jalandhar and Sult̤ānpūr,
a town of his own foundation. This angered him extremely
but he seems to have concealed his feelings for the time and to
have given Bābur counsel as if he were content. His son Dilāwar,
however, represented to Bābur that his father’s advice was
treacherous; it concerned a move to Multān, from which place
Daulat Khān may have come up to Dībālpūr and connected
with which at this time, something is recorded of co-operation
by Bābur and Shāh Ḥasan <i>Arghūn</i>. But the incident is not
yet found clearly described by a source. Dilāwar Khān told
Bābur that his father’s object was to divide and thus weaken
the invading force, and as this would have been the result of
taking Daulat Khān’s advice, Bābur arrested him and Apāq on
suspicion of treacherous intent. They were soon released, and
Sult̤ānpūr was given them, but they fled to the hills, there to
await a chance to swoop on the Panj-āb. Daulat Khān’s
hostility and his non-fulfilment of his engagement with Bābur
placing danger in the rear of an eastward advance, the Panj-āb
was garrisoned by Bābur’s own followers and he himself went
back to Kābul.</p>

<p>It is evident from what followed that Daulat Khān commanded
much strength in the Panj-āb; evident also that something
counselled delay in the attack on Ibrāhīm, perhaps closer cohesion
in favour of ‘Ālam Khān, certainly removal of the menace of
Daulat Khān in the rear; there may have been news already
of the approach of the Aūzbegs on Balkh which took Bābur
next year across Hindū-kush.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>c. The Panj-āb garrison.</i></p>

<p>The expedition had extended Bābur’s command considerably,
notably by obtaining possession of Lāhor. He now posted in
it Mīr ‘Abdu’l-‘azīz his Master of the Horse; in Dībālpūr he
posted, with ‘Ālam Khān, Bābā Qashqa <i>Mughūl</i>; in Sīālkot,
Khusrau Kūkūldāsh, in Kalanūr, Muḥammad ‘Alī <i>Tājik</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent"><i>d. Two deaths.</i></p>

<p>This year, on Rajab 19th (May 23rd) died Ismā‘īl <i>Ṣafawī</i> at
the age of 38, broken by defeat from Sult̤ān Salīm of Rūm.<a name="FNanchor_1563" id="FNanchor_1563"></a><a href="#Footnote_1563" class="fnanchor">1563</a>
He was succeeded by his son T̤ahmāsp, a child of ten.</p>

<p>This year may be that of the death of Shāh Shujā‘ <i>Arghūn</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1564" id="FNanchor_1564"></a><a href="#Footnote_1564" class="fnanchor">1564</a>
on Sha‘bān 22nd (July 18th), the last grief of his burden being
the death of his foster-brother Fāẓil concerning which, as well
as Shāh Beg’s own death, Mīr Ma‘ṣūm’s account is worthy of
full reproduction. Shāh Beg was succeeded in Sind by his son
Ḥasan, who read the <i>khut̤ba</i> for Bābur and drew closer links
with Bābur’s circle by marrying, either this year or the next,
Khalīfa’s daughter Gul-barg, with whom betrothal had been
made during Ḥasan’s visit to Bābur in Kābul. Moreover
Khalīfa’s son Muḥibb-i-‘alī married Nāhīd the daughter of Qāsim
Kūkūldāsh and Māh-chūchūk <i>Arghūn</i> (f. 214<i>b</i>). These alliances
were made, says Ma‘ṣūm, to strengthen Ḥasan’s position at
Bābur’s Court.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>e. A garden detail.</i></p>

<p>In this year and presumably on his return from the Panj-āb,
Bābur, as he himself chronicles (f. 132), had plantains (bananas)
brought from Hindūstān for the Bāgh-i-wafā at Adīnapūr.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">931 AH.&mdash;OCT. 29th 1524 to OCT. 18th 1525 AD.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><i>a. Daulat Khān.</i></p>

<p>Daulat Khān’s power in the Panj-āb is shewn by what he
effected after dispossessed of Lāhor. On Bābur’s return to Kābul,
he came down from the hills with a small body of his immediate
followers, seized his son Dilāwar, took Sult̤ānpūr, gathered a large
force and defeated ‘Ālam Khān in Dībālpūr. He detached 5000
men against Sīālkot but Bābur’s begs of Lāhor attacked and
overcame them. Ibrāhīm sent an army to reconquer the Panj-āb;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>Daulat Khān, profiting by its dissensions and discontents, won
over a part to himself and saw the rest break up.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>b. ‘Ālam Khān.</i></p>

<p>From his reverse at Dībālpūr, ‘Ālam Khān fled straight to
Kābul. The further help he asked was promised under the
condition that while he should take Ibrāhīm’s place on the throne
of Dihlī, Bābur in full suzerainty should hold Lāhor and all to
the west of it. This arranged, ‘Ālam Khān was furnished with
a body of troops, given a royal letter to the Lāhor begs ordering
them to assist him, and started off, Bābur promising to follow
swiftly.</p>

<p>‘Ālam Khān’s subsequent proceedings are told by Bābur in
the annals of 932 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (1525 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>) at the time he received details
about them (f. 255<i>b</i>).</p>

<p class="indent"><i>c. Bābur called to Balkh.</i></p>

<p>All we have yet found about this affair is what Bābur says in
explanation of his failure to follow ‘Ālam Khān as promised
(f. 256), namely, that he had to go to Balkh because all the
Aūzbeg Sult̤āns and Khāns had laid siege to it. Light on the
affair may come from some Persian or Aūzbeg chronicle; Bābur’s
arrival raised the siege; and risk must have been removed, for
Bābur returned to Kābul in time to set out for his fifth and last
expedition to Hindūstān on the first day of the second month
of next year (932 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> 1525). A considerable body of troops
was in Badakhshān with Humāyūn; their non-arrival next year
delaying his father’s progress, brought blame on himself.</p>

‘Abdu’l-malūk the armourer came into this camp; he had gone
seven or eight months earlier as my envoy to Sult̤ān Sa‘īd Khān
(in Kāshghar), and now brought one of the Khān’s men, styled
Yāngī Beg (new beg) Kūkūldāsh who conveyed letters, and

<p>(<i>Nov. 22nd</i>) On Wednesday (Ṣafar 6th), when we had dismounted
at Bārīk-āb, the younger brethren of Nūr Beg&mdash;he

their morning; on non-drinking days there were parties for

from Ghaznī. We marched in the evening of that same Sunday,
and dismounted in a new garden between Sult̤ānpur and Khwāja
Rustam.</p>

was always Qīrīq-ārīq, but not a sign or trace of the camp could
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;252b.</span>be seen when we got opposite it, nor any appearance of our
horses. Thought I, “Garm-chashma (Hot-spring) is close by;
they may have dismounted there.” So saying, we went on from
Qīrīq-ārīq. By the time we reached Garm-chashma, the very
day was late;<a name="FNanchor_1578" id="FNanchor_1578"></a><a href="#Footnote_1578" class="fnanchor">1578</a> we did not stop there, but going on in its
lateness (<i>kīchīsī</i>), had the raft tied up somewhere, and slept
awhile.</p>

<p>(<i>Dec. 8th</i>) At day-break we landed at Yada-bīr where, as the
day wore on, the army-folks began to come in. The camp must
have been at Qīrīq-ārīq, but out of our sight.</p>

<p>(<i>Dec. 8th continued</i>) Marching on that evening, we dismounted
at ‘Alī-masjid. The ground here being very confined, I always
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;253b.</span>used to dismount on a rise overlooking the camp in the valley-bottom.<a name="FNanchor_1592" id="FNanchor_1592"></a><a href="#Footnote_1592" class="fnanchor">1592</a>
The camp-fires made a wonderful illumination there
at night; assuredly it was because of this that there had always
been drinking there, and was so now.</p>

<p>(<i>Dec. 9th and 10th</i>) To-day I rode out before dawn; I preferred
a confection (<i>ma‘jūn</i>)<a name="FNanchor_1593" id="FNanchor_1593"></a><a href="#Footnote_1593" class="fnanchor">1593</a> and also kept this day a fast. We
dismounted near Bīgrām (Peshāwar); and next morning, the
camp remaining on that same ground, rode to Karg-awī.<a name="FNanchor_1594" id="FNanchor_1594"></a><a href="#Footnote_1594" class="fnanchor">1594</a> We
crossed the Siyāh-āb in front of Bīgrām, and formed our hunting-circle
looking down-stream. After a little, a person brought
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>word that there was a rhino in a bit of jungle near Bīgrām, and
that people had been stationed near-about it. We betook ourselves,
loose rein, to the place, formed a ring round the jungle,
made a noise, and brought the rhino out, when it took its way
across the plain. Humāyūn and those come with him from that
side (Tramontana), who had never seen one before, were much
entertained. It was pursued for two miles; many arrows were
shot at it; it was brought down without having made a good
set at man or horse. Two others were killed. I had often
wondered how a rhino and an elephant would behave if brought
face to face; this time one came out right in front of some
elephants the mahauts were bringing along; it did not face them<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;254.</span>
when the mahauts drove them towards it, but got off in another
direction.</p>

<p>On the day we were in Bīgrām, several of the begs and
household were appointed, with pay-masters and dīwāns, six or
seven being put in command, to take charge of the boats at the
Nīl-āb crossing, to make a list of all who were with the army,

<p>That evening I had fever and discharge<a name="FNanchor_1596" id="FNanchor_1596"></a><a href="#Footnote_1596" class="fnanchor">1596</a> which led on to
cough and every time I coughed, I spat blood. Anxiety was
great but, by God’s mercy, it passed off in two or three days.</p>

on the Kābul-water.</p>

having collected an army of from 20 to 30,000, had taken
Kilānūr, and intended to move on Lāhor. At once Mumin-i-‘alī
the commissary was sent galloping off to say, “We are advancing

<p>(<i>Dec. 14th</i>) With two night-halts on the way, we reached the

<p class="indent">(<i>f. Ferrying the Indus.</i>)</p>

<p>(<i>Dec. 16th</i>) On Saturday the 1st of the first Rabī‘, we crossed

dismounted on the bank of the river.<a name="FNanchor_1599" id="FNanchor_1599"></a><a href="#Footnote_1599" class="fnanchor">1599</a> The begs, pay-masters

12,000.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>g. The eastward march.</i>)</p>

<p>The rainfall had been somewhat scant in the plains, but
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;254b.</span>seemed to have been good in the cultivated lands along the
hill-skirts; for these reasons we took the road for Sīālkot along
the skirt-hills. Opposite Hātī <i>Kakar’s</i> country<a name="FNanchor_1600" id="FNanchor_1600"></a><a href="#Footnote_1600" class="fnanchor">1600</a> we came upon
a torrent<a name="FNanchor_1601" id="FNanchor_1601"></a><a href="#Footnote_1601" class="fnanchor">1601</a> the waters of which were standing in pools. Those
pools were all frozen over. The ice was not very thick, as thick
as the hand may-be. Such ice is unusual in Hindūstān; not
a sign or trace of any was seen in the years we were (<i>aīdūk</i>) in
the country.<a name="FNanchor_1602" id="FNanchor_1602"></a><a href="#Footnote_1602" class="fnanchor">1602</a></p>

<p>We had made five marches from the Sind-water; after the
sixth (<i>Dec. 22nd</i>&mdash;Rabī‘ I. 7th) we dismounted on a torrent
in the camping-ground (<i>yūrt</i>) of the Bugīāls<a name="FNanchor_1603" id="FNanchor_1603"></a><a href="#Footnote_1603" class="fnanchor">1603</a> below Balnāth
Jogī’s hill which connects with the Hill of Jūd.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span></p>
<p>(<i>Dec. 23rd</i>) In order to let people get provisions, we stayed
the next day in that camp. <i>‘Araq</i> was drunk on that day.
Mullā Muḥ. <i>Pargharī</i> told many stories; never had he been so
talkative. Mullā Shams himself was very riotous; once he
began, he did not finish till night.</p>

<p>The slaves and servants, good and bad, who had gone out
after provisions, went further than this<a name="FNanchor_1604" id="FNanchor_1604"></a><a href="#Footnote_1604" class="fnanchor">1604</a> and heedlessly scattered
over jungle and plain, hill and broken ground. Owing to this,
a few were overcome; Kīchkīna <i>tūnqit̤ār</i> died there.</p>

<p>(<i>Dec. 24th</i>) Marching on, we crossed the Bihat-water at a ford
below Jīlam (Jīhlam) and there dismounted. Walī <i>Qīzīl</i> (Rufus)
came there to see me. He was the Sīālkot reserve, and held
the parganas of Bīmrūkī and Akrīāda. Thinking about Sīālkot,<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;255.</span>
I took towards him the position of censure and reproach. He
excused himself, saying “I had come to my <i>pargana</i> before
Khusrau Kūkūldāsh left Sīālkot; he did not even send me
word.” After listening to his excuse, I said, “Since thou hast
paid no attention to Sīālkot, why didst thou not join the begs
in Lāhor?” He was convicted, but as work was at hand, I did
not trouble about his fault.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>h. Scouts sent with orders to Lāhor.</i>)</p>

<p>(<i>Dec. 25th</i>) Sayyid T̤ūfān and Sayyid Lāchīn were sent
galloping off, each with a pair-horse,<a name="FNanchor_1605" id="FNanchor_1605"></a><a href="#Footnote_1605" class="fnanchor">1605</a> to say in Lāhor, “Do
not join battle; meet us at Sīālkot or Parsrūr” (mod. Pasrūr).
It was in everyone’s mouth that Ghāzī Khān had collected 30
to 40,000 men, that Daulat Khān, old as he was, had girt two
swords to his waist, and that they were resolved to fight.
Thought I, “The proverb says that ten friends are better than
nine; do you not make a mistake: when the Lāhor begs have
joined you, fight there and then!”</p>

<p>(<i>Dec. 26th and 27th</i>) After starting off the two men to the
begs, we moved forward, halted one night, and next dismounted
on the bank of the Chīn-āb (Chan-āb).</p>

<p>As Buhlūlpūr was <i>khalṣa</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1606" id="FNanchor_1606"></a><a href="#Footnote_1606" class="fnanchor">1606</a> we left the road to visit it. Its
fort is situated above a deep ravine, on the bank of the Chīn-āb.
It pleased us much. We thought of bringing Sīālkot to it.
Please God! the chance coming, it shall be done straightway!
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;255b.</span>From Buhlūlpūr we went to camp by boat.</p>

<p>(<i>Dec. 29th</i>) On Friday the 14th of the first Rabī‘ we dismounted
at Sīālkot. If one go into Hindūstān the Jats and
Gujūrs always pour down in countless hordes from hill and plain
for loot in bullock and buffalo. These ill-omened peoples are
just senseless oppressors! Formerly their doings did not concern
us much because the country was an enemy’s, but they began
the same senseless work after we had taken it. When we
reached Sīālkot, they fell in tumult on poor and needy folks who
were coming out of the town to our camp, and stripped them
bare. I had the silly thieves sought for, and ordered two or
three of them cut to pieces.</p>

<p>From Sīālkot Nūr Beg’s brother Shāham also was made to
gallop off to the begs in Lāhor to say, “Make sure where the
enemy is; find out from some well-informed person where he
may be met, and send us word.”</p>

<p>A trader, coming into this camp, represented that ‘Ālam Khān
had let Sl. Ibrāhīm defeat him.</p>

<p>Here are the particulars:&mdash;‘Ālam Khān, after taking leave of
me (in Kābul, 931 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>), went off in that heat by double marches,
regardless of those with him.<a name="FNanchor_1609" id="FNanchor_1609"></a><a href="#Footnote_1609" class="fnanchor">1609</a> As at the time I gave him leave
to go, all the Aūzbeg khāns and sult̤āns had laid siege to Balkh,<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;256.</span>
I rode for Balkh as soon as I had given him his leave. On his
reaching Lāhor, he insisted to the begs, “You reinforce me; the
Pādshāh said so; march along with me; let us get (Apāq)
Ghāzī Khān to join us; let us move on Dihlī and Āgra.” Said
they, “Trusting to what, will you join Ghāzī Khān? Moreover
the royal orders to us were, ‘If at any time Ghāzī Khān has
sent his younger brother Ḥājī Khān with his son to Court, join
him; or do so, if he has sent them, by way of pledge, to Lāhor;
if he has done neither, do not join him.’ You yourself only
yesterday fought him and let him beat you! Trusting to what,
will you join him now? Besides all this, it is not for your
advantage to join him!” Having said what-not of this sort,
they refused ‘Ālam Khān. He did not fall in with their views,
but sent his son Sher Khān to speak with Daulat Khān and
with Ghāzī Khān, and afterwards all saw one another.</p>

<p>‘Ālam Khān took with him Dilāwar Khān, who had come
into Lāhor two or three months earlier after his escape from
prison; he took also Maḥmūd Khān (son of) Khān-i-jahān,<a name="FNanchor_1610" id="FNanchor_1610"></a><a href="#Footnote_1610" class="fnanchor">1610</a> to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>whom a <i>pargana</i> in the Lāhor district had been given. They
seem to have left matters at this:&mdash;Daulat Khān with Ghāzī
Khān was to take all the begs posted in Hindūstān to himself,
indeed he was to take everything on that side;<a name="FNanchor_1611" id="FNanchor_1611"></a><a href="#Footnote_1611" class="fnanchor">1611</a> while ‘Ālam
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;256b.</span>Khān was to take Dilāwar Khān and Ḥājī Khān and, reinforced
by them, was to capture Dihlī and Āgra. Ismā‘īl <i>Jilwānī</i> and
other amīrs came and saw ‘Ālam Khān; all then betook
themselves, march by march, straight for Dihlī. Near Indrī
came also Sulaimān Shaikh-zāda.<a name="FNanchor_1612" id="FNanchor_1612"></a><a href="#Footnote_1612" class="fnanchor">1612</a> Their total touched 30 to
40,000 men.</p>

<p>They laid siege to Dihlī but could neither take it by assault
nor do hurt to the garrison.<a name="FNanchor_1613" id="FNanchor_1613"></a><a href="#Footnote_1613" class="fnanchor">1613</a> When Sl. Ibrāhīm heard of their
assembly, he got an army to horse against them; when they
heard of his approach, they rose from before the place and
moved to meet him. They had left matters at this:&mdash;“If we
attack by day-light, the Afghāns will not desert (to us), for the
sake of their reputations with one another; but if we attack at
night when one man cannot see another, each man will obey
his own orders.” Twice over they started at fall of day from
a distance of 12 miles (6 <i>kurohs</i>), and, unable to bring matters
to a point, neither advanced nor retired; but just sat on horseback
for two or three watches. On a third occasion they delivered
an attack when one watch of night remained&mdash;their purpose
seeming to be the burning of tents and huts! They went; they
set fire from every end; they made a disturbance. Jalāl Khān
<i>Jig-hat</i><a name="FNanchor_1614" id="FNanchor_1614"></a><a href="#Footnote_1614" class="fnanchor">1614</a> came with other amīrs and saw ‘Ālam Khān.</p>

<p>Sl. Ibrāhīm did not bestir himself till shoot of dawn from
where he was with a few of his own family<a name="FNanchor_1615" id="FNanchor_1615"></a><a href="#Footnote_1615" class="fnanchor">1615</a> within his own

Sl. Ibrāhīm’s people moved out against them in rather small
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>force with one elephant. ‘Ālam Khān’s party, not able to make
stand against the elephant, ran away. He in his flight crossed
over into the Mīān-dū-āb and crossed back again when he
reached the Pānīpat neighbourhood. In Indrī he contrived on
some pretext to get 4 <i>laks</i> from Mīān Sulaimān.<a name="FNanchor_1616" id="FNanchor_1616"></a><a href="#Footnote_1616" class="fnanchor">1616</a> He was

(<i>Nūḥānī</i>)’s son Maḥmūd Khān, and by Shaikh Jamāl
<i>Farmulī</i>. When he was passing through Sihrind with Dilāwar

almost taken that strong fort when night came on. Those
inside were thinking of escape but could not get out because of
the press of horses in the Gate. There must have been elephants
also; when these were urged forward, they trod down and killed
many horses. ‘Ālam Khān, unable to escape mounted, got out
on foot in the darkness. After a <i>lak</i> of difficulties, he joined
Ghāzī Khān, who had not gone into Milwat but had fled into the

<p class="indent">(<i>k. Diary resumed.</i>)</p>

<p>A person came to Sīālkot from the Lāhor begs to say they
would arrive early next morning to wait on me.</p>

<p>(<i>Dec. 30th</i>) Marching early next day (Rabī‘ I. 15th), we
dismounted at Parsrūr. There Muḥ. ‘Alī <i>Jang-jang</i>, Khwāja
Ḥusain and several braves waited on me. As the enemy’s camp
seemed to be on the Lāhor side of the Rāvī, we sent men out
under Būjka for news. Near the third watch of the night they
brought word that the enemy, on hearing of us, had fled, no man
looking to another.</p>

<p>(<i>Dec. 31st</i>) Getting early to horse and leaving baggage and
train in the charge of Shāh Mīr Ḥusain and Jān Beg, we
bestirred ourselves. We reached Kalānūr in the afternoon, and
there dismounted. Muḥammad Sl. Mīrzā and ‘Ādil Sl.<a name="FNanchor_1623" id="FNanchor_1623"></a><a href="#Footnote_1623" class="fnanchor">1623</a> came
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;258.</span>to wait on me there, together with some of the begs.</p>

<p>(<i>Jan. 1st 1526 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span></i>) We marched early from Kalānūr. On
the road people gave us almost certain news of Ghāzī Khān and
other fugitives. Accordingly we sent, flying after those fliers,
the commanders Muḥammadī, Aḥmadī, Qūtlūq-qadam, Treasurer
Walī and most of those begs who, in Kābul, had recently bent
the knee for their begship. So far it was settled:&mdash;That it
would be good indeed if they could overtake and capture the
fugitives; and that, if they were not able to do this, they were
to keep careful watch round Milwat (Malot), so as to prevent
those inside from getting out and away. Ghāzī Khān was the
object of this watch.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>l. Capture of Milwat.</i>)</p>

<p>(<i>Jan. 2nd and 3rd</i>) After starting those begs ahead, we
crossed the Bīāh-water (Beas) opposite Kanwāhīn<a name="FNanchor_1624" id="FNanchor_1624"></a><a href="#Footnote_1624" class="fnanchor">1624</a> and dismounted.
From there we marched to the foot of the valley of
Fort Milwat, making two night-halts on the way. The begs who
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>had arrived before us, and also those of Hindūstān were ordered
to dismount in such a way as to besiege the place closely.</p>

<p>A grandson of Daulat Khān, son of his eldest son ‘Alī Khān,
Ismā‘īl Khān by name, came out of Milwat to see me; he took
back promise mingled with threat, kindness with menace.</p>

<p>(<i>Jan. 5th</i>) On Friday (Rabī‘ I. 21st) I moved camp forward
to within a mile of the fort, went myself to examine the place,
posted right, left and centre, then returned to camp.</p>

<p>Daulat Khān sent to represent to me that Ghāzī Khān had<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;258b.</span>
fled into the hills, and that, if his own faults were pardoned, he
would take service with me and surrender Milwat. Khwāja
Mīr-i-mīrān was sent to chase fear from his heart and to escort
him out; he came, and with him his son ‘Alī Khān. I had
ordered that the two swords he had girt to his waist to fight
me with, should be hung from his neck. Was such a rustic
blockhead possible! With things as they were, he still made
pretensions! When he was brought a little forward, I ordered
the swords to be removed from his neck. At the time of our
seeing one another<a name="FNanchor_1625" id="FNanchor_1625"></a><a href="#Footnote_1625" class="fnanchor">1625</a> he hesitated to kneel; I ordered them to
pull his leg and make him do so. I had him seated quite in
front, and ordered a person well acquainted with Hindūstānī to
interpret my words to him, one after another. Said I, “Thus
speak:&mdash;I called thee Father. I shewed thee more honour and
respect than thou couldst have asked. Thee and thy sons
I saved from door-to-door life amongst the Balūchīs.<a name="FNanchor_1626" id="FNanchor_1626"></a><a href="#Footnote_1626" class="fnanchor">1626</a> Thy

ours,<a name="FNanchor_1630" id="FNanchor_1630"></a><a href="#Footnote_1630" class="fnanchor">1630</a> and stir strife and trouble?” Dumbfounded, the old man
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span><span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;259.</span>stuttered a few words, but, he gave no answer, nor indeed could
answer be given to words so silencing. He was ordered to
remain with Khwāja Mīr-i-mīrān.</p>

<p>(<i>Jan. 6th</i>) On Saturday the 22nd of the first Rabī‘, I went
myself to safeguard the exit of the families and <i>ḥarams</i><a name="FNanchor_1631" id="FNanchor_1631"></a><a href="#Footnote_1631" class="fnanchor">1631</a> from
the fort, dismounting on a rise opposite the Gate. To me there
came ‘Alī Khān and made offering of a few <i>ashrafīs</i>. People
began to bring out the families just before the Other Prayer.
Though Ghāzī Khān was reported to have got away, there were some
who said they had seen him in the fort. For this reason several
of the household and braves<a name="FNanchor_1632" id="FNanchor_1632"></a><a href="#Footnote_1632" class="fnanchor">1632</a> were posted at the Gate, in order
to prevent his escape by a ruse, for to get away was his full
intention.<a name="FNanchor_1633" id="FNanchor_1633"></a><a href="#Footnote_1633" class="fnanchor">1633</a> Moreover if jewels and other valuables were being
taken away by stealth, they were to be confiscated. I spent
that night in a tent pitched on the rise in front of the Gate.</p>

<p>(<i>Jan. 7th</i>) Early next morning, Muḥammadī, Aḥmadī, Sl.
Junaid, ‘Abdu’l-‘azīz, Muḥammad ‘Alī <i>Jang-jang</i> and Qūtlūq-qadam
were ordered to enter the fort and take possession of all
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;259b.</span>effects. As there was much disturbance at the Gate, I shot off
a few arrows by way of chastisement. Humāyūn’s story-teller
(<i>qiṣṣa-khẉān</i>) was struck by the arrow of his destiny and at
once surrendered his life.</p>

<p>(<i>Jan. 7th and 8th</i>) After spending two nights<a name="FNanchor_1634" id="FNanchor_1634"></a><a href="#Footnote_1634" class="fnanchor">1634</a> on the rise,
I inspected the fort. I went into Ghāzī Khān’s book-room;<a name="FNanchor_1635" id="FNanchor_1635"></a><a href="#Footnote_1635" class="fnanchor">1635</a>
some of the precious things found in it, I gave to Humāyūn,
some sent to Kāmrān (in Qandahār). There were many books
of learned contents,<a name="FNanchor_1636" id="FNanchor_1636"></a><a href="#Footnote_1636" class="fnanchor">1636</a> but not so many valuable ones as had at
first appeared. I passed that night in the fort; next morning
I went back to camp.</p>

<p>(<i>Jan. 9th</i>) It had been in our minds that Ghāzī Khān was in
the fort, but he, a man devoid of nice sense of honour, had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>escaped to the hills, abandoning father, brethren and sisters in
Milwat.</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>(<i>Jan. 10th</i>) Leaving that camp on Wednesday, we moved
towards the hills to which Ghāzī Khān had fled. When we
dismounted in the valley-bottom two miles from the camp in
the mouth of Milwat,<a name="FNanchor_1637" id="FNanchor_1637"></a><a href="#Footnote_1637" class="fnanchor">1637</a> Dilāwar Khān came and waited on me.
Daulat Khān, ‘Alī Khān and Ismā‘īl Khān, with other chiefs,
were given into Kitta Beg’s charge who was to convey them to
the Bhīra fort of Milwat (Malot),<a name="FNanchor_1638" id="FNanchor_1638"></a><a href="#Footnote_1638" class="fnanchor">1638</a> and there keep guard over<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;260.</span>
them. In agreement with Dilāwar Khān, blood-ransom was
fixed for some who had been made over each to one man; some
gave security, some were kept prisoner. Daulat Khān died
when Kitta Beg reached Sult̤ānpūr with the prisoners.<a name="FNanchor_1639" id="FNanchor_1639"></a><a href="#Footnote_1639" class="fnanchor">1639</a></p>

<p>Milwat was given into the charge of Muḥ. ‘Alī <i>Jang-jang</i> who,
pledging his own life for it, left his elder brother Arghūn and
a party of braves in it. A body of from 200 to 250 Afghāns
were told off to reinforce him.</p>

<p>Khwāja Kalān had loaded several camels with Ghaznī wines.
A party was held in his quarters overlooking the fort and the
whole camp, some drinking <i>‘araq</i>, some wine. It was a varied
party.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>m. Jaswān-valley.</i>)</p>

<p>Marching on, we crossed a low hill of the grazing-grounds
(<i>arghā-dāl-līq</i>) of Milwat and went into the <i>dūn</i>, as Hindūstānīs
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>
are understood to call a dale (<i>julga</i>).<a name="FNanchor_1640" id="FNanchor_1640"></a><a href="#Footnote_1640" class="fnanchor">1640</a> In this dale is a running-water<a name="FNanchor_1641" id="FNanchor_1641"></a><a href="#Footnote_1641" class="fnanchor">1641</a>
of Hindūstān; along its sides are many villages; and it
is said to be the pargana of the Jaswāl, that is to say, of
Dilāwar Khān’s maternal uncles. It lies there shut-in, with
meadows along its torrent, rice cultivated here and there, a three
or four mill-stream flowing in its trough, its width from two to
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;260b.</span>four miles, six even in places, villages on the skirts of its hills&mdash;hillocks
they are rather&mdash;where there are no villages, peacocks,
monkeys, and many fowls which, except that they are mostly of
one colour, are exactly like house-fowls.</p>

<p>As no reliable news was had of Ghāzī Khān, we arranged for
Tardīka to go with Bīrīm Deo <i>Malinhās</i> and capture him
wherever he might be found.</p>

<p>In the hills of this dale stand thoroughly strong forts; one on
the north-east, named Kūtila, has sides 70 to 80 yards (<i>qārī</i>)
of straight fall, the side where the great gate is being perhaps
7 or 8 yards.<a name="FNanchor_1642" id="FNanchor_1642"></a><a href="#Footnote_1642" class="fnanchor">1642</a> The width of the place where the draw-bridge
is made, may be 10 to 12 yards. Across this they have made
a bridge of two tall trees<a name="FNanchor_1643" id="FNanchor_1643"></a><a href="#Footnote_1643" class="fnanchor">1643</a> by which horses and herds are taken
over. This was one of the local forts Ghāzī Khān had
strengthened; his man will have been in it now. Our raiders
(<i>chāpqūnchī</i>) assaulted it and had almost taken it when night
came on. The garrison abandoned this difficult place and went
off. Near this dale is also the stronghold of Ginguta; it is girt
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>round by precipices as Kūtila is, but is not so strong as Kūtila.

<p class="indent">(<i>n. Bābur advances against Ibrāhīm.</i>)</p>

<p>After despatching the light troop against Ghāzī Khān, I put
my foot in the stirrup of resolution, set my hand on the rein of

Sult̤ān Sikandar, son of Buhlūl <i>Lūdī Afghān</i>, in possession of
whose throne at that time were the Dihlī capital and the

about 1,000.</p>

their effort and endeavour towards this. In response, we sent,
by a foot-man, royal letters expressing our favour. We then
marched on.</p>

to which because of their strength, no-one seemed to have
gone for a long time&mdash;and came back to me after plundering
a little. Came also ‘Ālam Khān, on foot, ruined, stripped bare.

<p>Raiders of ours went into the hills and valleys round-about,
but after a few nights’ absence, came back without anything to

<p class="indent">(<i>p. Incidents of the march for Pānī-pat.</i>)</p>

<p>While we were in the (Jaswān) <i>dūn</i>, dutiful letters had come
more than once from Ismā‘īl <i>Jilwānī</i> and Biban; we replied to
them from this place by royal letters such as their hearts
desired. After we got out of the dale to Rūpar, it rained very
much and became so cold that a mass of starved and naked
Hindūstānīs died.</p>

<p>When we had left Rūpar and were dismounted at Karal,<a name="FNanchor_1649" id="FNanchor_1649"></a><a href="#Footnote_1649" class="fnanchor">1649</a>
opposite Sihrind, a Hindūstānī coming said, “I am Sl. Ibrāhīm’s
envoy,” and though he had no letter or credentials, asked for an
envoy from us. We responded at once by sending one or two
Sawādī night-guards (<i>tunqit̤ār</i>).<a name="FNanchor_1650" id="FNanchor_1650"></a><a href="#Footnote_1650" class="fnanchor">1650</a> These humble persons Ibrāhīm

call it the water of Kakar (Ghaggar). Chitr also is on its bank.
We rode up it for an excursion. The rising-place (<i>zih</i>) of the
water of this torrent (<i>rūd</i>) is 3 or 4 <i>kurohs</i> (6-8 m.) above Chitr.
Going up the (Kakar) torrent, we came to where a 4 or 5 millstream
issues from a broad (side-)valley (<i>dara</i>), up which there<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;262.</span>
are very pleasant places, healthy and convenient. I ordered
a Chār-bāgh to be made at the mouth of the broad valley of
this (tributary) water, which falls into the (Kakar-) torrent after
flowing for one or two <i>kurohs</i> through level ground. From its
infall to the springs of the Kakar the distance may be
3 to 4 <i>kurohs</i> (6-8 m.). When it comes down in flood during the
rains and joins the Kakar, they go together to Sāmāna and
Sanām.<a name="FNanchor_1653" id="FNanchor_1653"></a><a href="#Footnote_1653" class="fnanchor">1653</a></p>

<p>Biban waited on me in this camp. These Afghāns remain
very rustic and tactless! This person asked to sit although
Dilāwar Khān, his superior in following and in rank, did not sit,
and although the sons of ‘Ālam Khān, who are of royal birth,
did not sit. Little ear was lent to his unreason!</p>

<p>(<i>Feb. 26th</i>) At dawn on Monday the 14th Humāyūn moved
out against Ḥamīd Khān. After advancing for some distance,
he sent between 100 and 150 braves scouting ahead, who went
close up to the enemy and at once got to grips. But when
after a few encounters, the dark mass of Humāyūn’s troops
shewed in the rear, the enemy ran right away. Humāyūn’s men
unhorsed from 100 to 200, struck the heads off one half and
brought the other half in, together with 7 or 8 elephants.</p>

<p>(<i>March 2nd</i>) On Friday the 18th of the month, Beg Mīrak
<i>Mughūl</i> brought news of Humāyūn’s victory to the camp. He
(Humāyūn?) was there and then given a special head-to-foot
and a special horse from the royal stable, besides promise of
guerdon (<i>juldū</i>).</p>

<p>(<i>March 5th</i>) On Monday the 25th of the month, Humāyūn
arrived to wait on me, bringing with him as many as 100
prisoners and 7 or 8 elephants. Ustād ‘Alī-qulī and the
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;263.</span>matchlockmen were ordered to shoot all the prisoners, by way
of example. This had been Humāyūn’s first affair, his first
experience of battle; it was an excellent omen!</p>

<p>Our men who had gone in pursuit of the fugitives, took
Ḥiṣār-fīrūza at once on arrival, plundered it, and returned to us.
It was given in guerdon to Humāyūn, with all its dependencies
and appurtenances, with it also a <i>kror</i> of money.</p>

opposite Sarsāwa. From that ground Khwāja Kalān’s servant

made as if coming out in a sort of array, but our men closed
with his at once, overcame them, hustled them off, pursued and
unhorsed them till they were opposite Ibrāhīm’s own camp.
Ḥātim Khān was one of those unhorsed, who was Daud Khān
(<i>Lūdī</i>)’s elder brother and one of his commanders. Our men
brought him in when they waited on me. They brought also
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;264.</span>60-70 prisoners and 6 or 7 elephants. Most of the prisoners,
by way of warning, were made to reach their death-doom.</p>

the army was numbered;<a name="FNanchor_1659" id="FNanchor_1659"></a><a href="#Footnote_1659" class="fnanchor">1659</a> it did not count up to what had
been estimated.</p>

<p>At our next camp it was ordered that every man in the army
should collect carts, each one according to his circumstances.
Seven hundred carts (<i>arāba</i>) were brought<a name="FNanchor_1660" id="FNanchor_1660"></a><a href="#Footnote_1660" class="fnanchor">1660</a> in. The order given
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>to Ustād ‘Alī-qulī was that these carts should be joined together
in Ottoman<a name="FNanchor_1661" id="FNanchor_1661"></a><a href="#Footnote_1661" class="fnanchor">1661</a> fashion, but using ropes of raw hide instead of
chains, and that between every two carts 5 or 6 mantelets should
be fixed, behind which the matchlockmen were to stand to fire.
To allow of collecting all appliances, we delayed 5 or 6 days in
that camp. When everything was ready, all the begs with such
braves as had had experience in military affairs were summoned
to a General Council where opinion found decision at this:&mdash;Pānī-pat<a name="FNanchor_1662" id="FNanchor_1662"></a><a href="#Footnote_1662" class="fnanchor">1662</a>
is there with its crowded houses and suburbs. It
would be on one side of us; our other sides must be protected
by carts and mantelets behind which our foot and matchlockmen
would stand. With so much settled we marched forward, halted
one night on the way, and reached Pānī-pat on Thursday the
last day (29th) of the second Jumāda (April 12th).</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>u. The opposed forces.</i>)</p>

<p>On our right was the town of Pānī-pat with its suburbs; in

horsemen.</p>

<p>Some in the army were very anxious and full of fear. Nothing
recommends anxiety and fear. For why? Because what God
has fixed in eternity cannot be changed. But though this is so,
it was no reproach to be afraid and anxious. For why? Because
those thus anxious and afraid were there with a two or three
months’ journey between them and their homes; our affair was

<p>People estimated the army opposing us at 100,000 men;

1000. In his hands was the treasure of two forbears.<a name="FNanchor_1665" id="FNanchor_1665"></a><a href="#Footnote_1665" class="fnanchor">1665</a> In

by avarice and had a craving insatiable to pile coin on coin?
He was an unproved brave<a name="FNanchor_1667" id="FNanchor_1667"></a><a href="#Footnote_1667" class="fnanchor">1667</a>; he provided nothing for his

nor fight.</p>

<p>In the interval at Pānī-pat during which the army was
preparing defence on our every side with cart, ditch and branch,
Darwīsh-i-muḥammad <i>Sārbān</i> had once said to me, “With such

I, “Are you likening him to the Aūzbeg khāns and sult̤āns?

gathered and came against us, we brought the families and the goods of the
Mughūls and soldiers into the Ḥiṣār suburbs and fortified these by closing the
lanes. As those khāns and sult̤āns were experienced in equipment, in planned
operations, and in resolute resistance, they saw from our fortification of Ḥiṣār
that we were determined on life or death within it, saw they could not count
on taking it by assault and, therefore, retired at once from near Nūndāk of

<p class="indent">(<i>v. Preliminary encounters.</i>)</p>

<p>During the 7 or 8 days we lay in Pānī-pat, our men used to
go, a few together, close up to Ibrāhīm’s camp, rain arrows down
on his massed troops, cut off and bring in heads. Still he made<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;265b.</span>
no move; nor did his troops sally out. At length, we acted on
the advice of several Hindūstānī well-wishers and sent out 4 or
5000 men to deliver a night-attack on his camp, the leaders of
it being Mahdī Khwāja, Muḥammad Sl. Mīrzā, ‘Ādil Sult̤ān,
Khusrau, Shāh Mīr Ḥusain, Sl. Junaid <i>Barlās</i>, ‘Abdu’l-‘azīz the
Master of the Horse, Muḥ. ‘Alī <i>Jang-jang</i>, Qūtlūq-qadam,
Treasurer Walī, Khalīfa’s Muḥibb-i-‘alī, Pay-master Muḥammad,
Jān Beg and Qarā-qūzī. It being dark, they were not able to
act together well, and, having scattered, could effect nothing on
arrival. They stayed near Ibrāhīm’s camp till dawn, when the
nagarets sounded and troops of his came out in array with
elephants. Though our men did not do their work, they got
off safe and sound; not a man of them was killed, though they
were in touch with such a mass of foes. One arrow pierced
Muḥ. ‘Alī <i>Jang-jang</i>’s leg; though the wound was not mortal,
he was good-for-nothing on the day of battle.</p>

<p>On hearing of this affair, I sent off Humāyūn and his troops
to go 2 or 3 miles to meet them, and followed him myself with
the rest of the army in battle-array. The party of the night-attack
joined him and came back with him. The enemy making
no further advance, we returned to camp and dismounted. That
night a false alarm fell on the camp; for some 20 minutes (one
<i>garī</i>) there were uproar and call-to-arms; the disturbance died
down after a time.<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;266.</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>]</p>

Darwīsh-i-muḥammad <i>Sārbān</i> and ‘Abdu’l-lāh the librarian.
The left of the centre was Khalīfa, Khwāja Mīr-i-mīrān,
Secretary Aḥmadī, Tardī Beg (brother) of Qūj Beg, Khalīfa’s
Muḥibb-i-‘alī and Mīrzā Beg Tarkhān. The advance was
Khusrau Kūkūldāsh and Muḥ. ‘Alī <i>Jang-jang</i>. ‘Abdu’l-'azīz
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span>the Master of the Horse was posted as the reserve. For the
turning-party (<i>tūlghuma</i>) at the point of the right wing,<a name="FNanchor_1675" id="FNanchor_1675"></a><a href="#Footnote_1675" class="fnanchor">1675</a> we
fixed on Red Walī and Malik Qāsim (brother) of Bābā <i>Qashqa</i>,
with their Mughūls; for the turning-party at the point of the
left wing, we arrayed Qarā-qūzī, Abū’l-muḥammad the lance-player,
Shaikh Jamāl <i>Bārīn’s</i> Shaikh ‘Alī, Mahndī(?) and
Tīngrī-bīrdī <i>Bashaghī</i>(?) <i>Mughūl</i>; these two parties, directly
the enemy got near, were to turn his rear, one from the right,
the other from the left.<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;266b.</span></p>

<p>When the dark mass of the enemy first came in sight, he
seemed to incline towards our right; ‘Abdu’l-‘azīz, who was the
right-reserve, was sent therefore to reinforce the right. From
the time that Sl. Ibrāhīm’s blackness first appeared, he moved
swiftly, straight for us, without a check, until he saw the dark
mass of our men, when his pulled up and, observing our formation
and array,<a name="FNanchor_1676" id="FNanchor_1676"></a><a href="#Footnote_1676" class="fnanchor">1676</a> made as if asking, “To stand or not? To advance
or not?” They could not stand; nor could they make their
former swift advance.</p>

<p>Our orders were for the turning-parties to wheel from right
and left to the enemy’s rear, to discharge arrows and to engage
in the fight; and for the right and left (wings) to advance and
join battle with him. The turning-parties wheeled round and
began to rain arrows down. Mahdī Khwāja was the first of the
left to engage; he was faced by a troop having an elephant with
it; his men’s flights of arrows forced it to retire. To reinforce
the left I sent Secretary Aḥmadī and also Qūj Beg’s Tardī Beg
and Khalīfa’s Muḥibb-i-'alī. On the right also there was some
stubborn fighting. Orders were given for Muḥammadī Kūkūldāsh,
Shāh Manṣūr <i>Barlās</i>, Yūnas-i-‘alī and ‘Abdu’l-lāh to engage
those facing them in front of the centre. From that same
position Ustād ‘Alī-qulī made good discharge of <i>firingī</i> shots;<a name="FNanchor_1677" id="FNanchor_1677"></a><a href="#Footnote_1677" class="fnanchor">1677</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span></p>

<p>Must̤afa the commissary for his part made excellent discharge
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;267.</span>of <i>zarb-zan</i> shots from the left hand of the centre. Our right,
left, centre and turning-parties having surrounded the enemy,
rained arrows down on him and fought ungrudgingly. He
made one or two small charges on our right and left but under
our men’s arrows, fell back on his own centre. His right and
left hands (<i>qūl</i>) were massed in such a crowd that they could
neither move forward against us nor force a way for flight.</p>

<p>When the incitement to battle had come, the Sun was spear-high;
till mid-day fighting had been in full force; noon passed,
the foe was crushed in defeat, our friends rejoicing and gay.
By God’s mercy and kindness, this difficult affair was made easy
for us! In one half-day, that armed mass was laid upon the
earth. Five or six thousand men were killed in one place close
to Ibrāhīm. Our estimate of the other dead, lying all over the
field, was 15 to 16,000, but it came to be known, later in Āgra
from the statements of Hindūstānīs, that 40 or 50,000 may have
died in that battle.<a name="FNanchor_1678" id="FNanchor_1678"></a><a href="#Footnote_1678" class="fnanchor">1678</a></p>

<p>The foe defeated, pursuit and unhorsing of fugitives began.
Our men brought in amīrs of all ranks and the chiefs they
captured; <i>mahauts</i> made offering of herd after herd of elephants.</p>

<p>Ibrāhīm was thought to have fled; therefore, while pursuing
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;267b.</span>the enemy, we told off Qismatāī Mīrzā, Bābā <i>chuhra</i> and Būjka
of the <i>khaṣa-tābīn</i><a name="FNanchor_1679" id="FNanchor_1679"></a><a href="#Footnote_1679" class="fnanchor">1679</a> to lead swift pursuit to Āgra and try to
take him. We passed through his camp, looked into his own
enclosure (<i>sarācha</i>) and quarters, and dismounted on the bank
of standing-water (<i>qarā-sū</i>).</p>

begs, sometimes to the non-accompaniment of elder and younger
brethren,<a name="FNanchor_1699" id="FNanchor_1699"></a><a href="#Footnote_1699" class="fnanchor">1699</a> a move on Hindūstān had not been practicable and its
territories had remained unsubdued. At length no such obstacles
were left; no beg, great or small (<i>beg begāt</i>) of lower birth,<a name="FNanchor_1700" id="FNanchor_1700"></a><a href="#Footnote_1700" class="fnanchor">1700</a> could
speak an opposing word. In 925 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (1519 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>) we led an army
out and, after taking Bajaur by storm in 2-3 <i>garī</i> (44-66 minutes),
and making a general massacre of its people, went on into Bhīra.
Bhīra we neither over-ran nor plundered; we imposed a ransom
on its people, taking from them in money and goods to the value
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span>of 4 <i>laks</i> of <i>shāhrukhīs</i> and having shared this out to the army

laboriously held tight<a name="FNanchor_1701" id="FNanchor_1701"></a><a href="#Footnote_1701" class="fnanchor">1701</a> to Hindūstān, five times leading an army

and favour, made such a foe as Sl. Ibrāhīm the vanquished and

<p class="indent">(<i>b. Three invaders from Tramontana.</i>)</p>

<p>From the time of the revered Prophet down till now<a name="FNanchor_1703" id="FNanchor_1703"></a><a href="#Footnote_1703" class="fnanchor">1703</a> three
men from that side<a name="FNanchor_1704" id="FNanchor_1704"></a><a href="#Footnote_1704" class="fnanchor">1704</a> have conquered and ruled Hindūstān. Sl.
Maḥmūd <i>Ghāzī</i><a name="FNanchor_1705" id="FNanchor_1705"></a><a href="#Footnote_1705" class="fnanchor">1705</a> was the first, who and whose descendants sat
long on the seat of government in Hindūstān. Sl. Shihābu’d-dīn<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;269b.</span>
of Ghūr was the second,<a name="FNanchor_1706" id="FNanchor_1706"></a><a href="#Footnote_1706" class="fnanchor">1706</a> whose slaves and dependants royally
shepherded<a name="FNanchor_1707" id="FNanchor_1707"></a><a href="#Footnote_1707" class="fnanchor">1707</a> this realm for many years. I am the third.</p>

<p>But my task was not like the task of those other rulers. For
why? Because Sl. Maḥmūd, when he conquered Hindūstān, had
the throne of Khurāsān subject to his rule, vassal and obedient to
him were the sult̤āns of Khwārizm and the Marches (<i>Dāru’l-marz</i>),
and under his hand was the ruler of Samarkand. Though his
army may not have numbered 2 <i>laks</i>, what question is there that
it<a name="FNanchor_1708" id="FNanchor_1708"></a><a href="#Footnote_1708" class="fnanchor">1708</a> was one. Then again, rājas were his opponents; all Hindūstān
was not under one supreme head (<i>pādshāh</i>), but each rāja
ruled independently in his own country. Sl. Shihābu’d-dīn again,&mdash;though
he himself had no rule in Khurāsān, his elder brother
Ghiyās̤u’d-dīn had it. The <i>T̤abaqāt-i-nāṣirī</i><a name="FNanchor_1709" id="FNanchor_1709"></a><a href="#Footnote_1709" class="fnanchor">1709</a> brings it forward
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>that he once led into Hindūstān an army of 120,000 men and
horse in mail.<a name="FNanchor_1710" id="FNanchor_1710"></a><a href="#Footnote_1710" class="fnanchor">1710</a> His opponents also were rāīs and rājas; one
man did not hold all Hindūstān.</p>

<p>That time we came to Bhīra, we had at most some 1500 to
2000 men. We had made no previous move on Hindūstān with
an army equal to that which came the fifth time, when we beat
Sl. Ibrāhīm and conquered the realm of Hindūstān, the total
written down for which, taking one retainer with another, and
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;270.</span>with traders and servants, was 12,000. Dependent on me were
the countries of Badakhshān, Qūndūz, Kābul and Qandahār, but
no reckonable profit came from them, rather it was necessary to
reinforce them fully because several lie close to an enemy. Then
again, all Māwarā’u’n-nahr was in the power of the Aūzbeg khāns
and sult̤āns, an ancient foe whose armies counted up to 100,000.
Moreover Hindūstān, from Bhīra to Bihār, was in the power of
the Afghāns and in it Sl. Ibrāhīm was supreme. In proportion
to his territory his army ought to have been 5 <i>laks</i>, but at that
time the Eastern amīrs were in hostility to him. His army was
estimated at 100,000 and people said his elephants and those of
his amīrs were 1000.</p>

<p>Under such conditions, in this strength, and having in my rear
100,000 old enemies such as are the Aūzbegs, we put trust in God
and faced the ruler of such a dense army and of domains so wide.
As our trust was in Him, the most high God did not make our
labour and hardships vain, but defeated that powerful foe and
conquered that broad realm. Not as due to strength and effort
of our own do we look upon this good fortune, but as had solely
through God’s pleasure and kindness. We know that this
happiness was not the fruit of our own ambition and resolve, but
that it was purely from His mercy and favour.</p>

<p class="center">DESCRIPTION OF HINDŪSTĀN.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>a. Hindūstān.</i>)</p>

<p>The country of Hindūstān is extensive, full of men, and full
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;270b.</span>of produce. On the east, south, and even on the west, it ends at
its great enclosing ocean (<i>muḥit̤ daryā-sī-gha</i>). On the north
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span>it has mountains which connect with those of Hindū-kush,
Kāfiristān and Kashmīr. North-west of it lie Kābul, Ghaznī
and Qandahār. Dihlī is held (<i>aīrīmīsh</i>) to be the capital of the
whole of Hindūstān. From the death of Shihābu’d-dīn <i>Ghūrī</i>
(d. 602 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1206 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>) to the latter part of the reign of Sl. Fīrūz
Shāh (<i>Tūghlūq Turk</i> d. 790 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1388 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>), the greater part of
Hindūstān must have been under the rule of the sult̤āns of Dihlī.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>b. Rulers contemporary with Bābur’s conquest.</i>)</p>

<p>At the date of my conquest of Hindūstān it was governed by
five Musalmān rulers (<i>pādshāh</i>)<a name="FNanchor_1711" id="FNanchor_1711"></a><a href="#Footnote_1711" class="fnanchor">1711</a> and two Pagans (<i>kāfir</i>). These
were the respected and independent rulers, but there were also,
in the hills and jungles, many rāīs and rājas, held in little esteem
(<i>kīchīk karīm</i>).</p>

<p>First, there were the Afghāns who had possession of Dihlī, the
capital, and held the country from Bhīra to Bihār. Jūnpūr, before
their time, had been in possession of Sl. Ḥusain <i>Sharqī</i> (Eastern)<a name="FNanchor_1712" id="FNanchor_1712"></a><a href="#Footnote_1712" class="fnanchor">1712</a>
whose dynasty Hindūstānīs call Pūrabī (Eastern). His ancestors
will have been cup-bearers in the presence of Sl. Fīrūz Shāh
and those (Tūghlūq) sult̤āns; they became supreme in Jūnpūr
after his death.<a name="FNanchor_1713" id="FNanchor_1713"></a><a href="#Footnote_1713" class="fnanchor">1713</a> At that time Dihlī was in the hands of
Sl. ‘Alāu’u’d-dīn (‘Ālam Khān) of the Sayyid dynasty to whose
ancestor Tīmūr Beg had given it when, after having captured it,
he went away.<a name="FNanchor_1714" id="FNanchor_1714"></a><a href="#Footnote_1714" class="fnanchor">1714</a> Sl. Buhlūl <i>Lūdī</i> and his son (Sikandar) got
possession of the capital Jūnpūr and the capital Dihlī, and
brought both under one government (881 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1476 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>).</p>

<p>Secondly, there was Sl. Muḥammad Muz̤affer in Gujrāt; he
departed from the world a few days before the defeat of
Sl. Ibrāhīm. He was skilled in the Law, a ruler (<i>pādshāh</i>) seeking<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;271.</span>
after knowledge, and a constant copyist of the Holy Book. His
dynasty people call Tānk.<a name="FNanchor_1715" id="FNanchor_1715"></a><a href="#Footnote_1715" class="fnanchor">1715</a> His ancestors also will have been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>wine-servers to Sl. Fīrūz Shāh and those (Tūghlūq) sult̤āns; they
became possessed of Gujrāt after his death.</p>

<p>Thirdly, there were the Bāhmanīs of the Dakkan (Deccan, <i>i.e.</i>
South), but at the present time no independent authority is left
them; their great begs have laid hands on the whole country,
and must be asked for whatever is needed.<a name="FNanchor_1716" id="FNanchor_1716"></a><a href="#Footnote_1716" class="fnanchor">1716</a></p>

<p>Fourthly, there was Sl. Maḥmūd in the country of Malwā,
which people call also Mandāū.<a name="FNanchor_1717" id="FNanchor_1717"></a><a href="#Footnote_1717" class="fnanchor">1717</a> His dynasty they call Khilīj
(<i>Turk</i>). Rānā Sangā had defeated Sl. Maḥmūd and taken
possession of most of his country. This dynasty also has
become feeble. Sl. Maḥmūd’s ancestors also must have been
cherished by Sl. Fīrūz Shāh; they became possessed of the
Malwā country after his death.<a name="FNanchor_1718" id="FNanchor_1718"></a><a href="#Footnote_1718" class="fnanchor">1718</a></p>

<p>Fifthly, there was Naṣrat Shāh<a name="FNanchor_1719" id="FNanchor_1719"></a><a href="#Footnote_1719" class="fnanchor">1719</a> in the country of Bengal.
His father (Ḥusain Shāh), a sayyid styled ‘Alāu’u’d-dīn, had
ruled in Bengal and Naṣrat Shāh attained to rule by inheritance.
A surprising custom in Bengal is that hereditary succession is
rare. The royal office is permanent and there are permanent
offices of amīrs, wazīrs and manṣab-dārs (officials). It is the
office that Bengalis regard with respect. Attached to each
office is a body of obedient, subordinate retainers and servants.
If the royal heart demand that a person should be dismissed
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;271b.</span>and another be appointed to sit in his place, the whole body of
subordinates attached to that office become the (new) office-holder’s.
There is indeed this peculiarity of the royal office
itself that any person who kills the ruler (<i>pādshāh</i>) and seats
himself on the throne, becomes ruler himself; amīrs, wazīrs,
soldiers and peasants submit to him at once, obey him, and
recognize him for the rightful ruler his predecessor in office had
been.<a name="FNanchor_1720" id="FNanchor_1720"></a><a href="#Footnote_1720" class="fnanchor">1720</a> Bengalis say, “We are faithful to the throne; we loyally
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>obey whoever occupies it.” As for instance, before the reign of
Naṣrat Shāh’s father ‘Alāu’u’d-dīn, an Abyssinian (<i>Ḥabshī</i>,
named Muz̤affar Shāh) had killed his sovereign (Maḥmūd
Shāh <i>Ilyās</i>), mounted the throne and ruled for some time.
‘Alāu’u’d-dīn killed that Abyssinian, seated himself on the throne
and became ruler. When he died, his son (Naṣrat) became
ruler by inheritance. Another Bengali custom is to regard it
as a disgraceful fault in a new ruler if he expend and consume
the treasure of his predecessors. On coming to rule he must
gather treasure of his own. To amass treasure Bengalis regard
as a glorious distinction. Another custom in Bengal is that
from ancient times <i>parganas</i> have been assigned to meet the
charges of the treasury, stables, and all royal expenditure and
to defray these charges no impost is laid on other lands.</p>

<p>These five, mentioned above, were the great Musalmān rulers,
honoured in Hindūstān, many-legioned, and broad-landed. Of
the Pagans the greater both in territory and army, is the Rāja
of Bījānagar.<a name="FNanchor_1721" id="FNanchor_1721"></a><a href="#Footnote_1721" class="fnanchor">1721</a><span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;272.</span></p>

<p>The second is Rānā Sangā who in these latter days had
grown great by his own valour and sword. His original country
was Chitūr; in the downfall from power of the Mandāū sult̤āns,
he became possessed of many of their dependencies such as
Rantanbūr, Sārangpūr, Bhīlsān and Chandīrī. Chandīrī I stormed
in 934 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (1528 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>)<a name="FNanchor_1722" id="FNanchor_1722"></a><a href="#Footnote_1722" class="fnanchor">1722</a> and, by God’s pleasure, took it in a few
hours; in it was Rānā Sangā’s great and trusted man Midnī
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span>Rāo; we made general massacre of the Pagans in it and, as will
be narrated, converted what for many years had been a mansion
of hostility, into a mansion of Islām.</p>

<p>There are very many rāīs and rājas on all sides and quarters
of Hindūstān, some obedient to Islām, some, because of their
remoteness or because their places are fastnesses, not subject to
Musalmān rule.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>c. Of Hindūstān.</i>)</p>

<p>Hindūstān is of the first climate, the second climate, and
the third climate; of the fourth climate it has none. It is
a wonderful country. Compared with our countries it is a
different world; its mountains, rivers, jungles and deserts, its
towns, its cultivated lands, its animals and plants, its peoples
and their tongues, its rains, and its winds, are all different. In
some respects the hot-country (<i>garm-sīl</i>) that depends on Kābul,
is like Hindūstān, but in others, it is different. Once the water
of Sind is crossed, everything is in the Hindūstān way (<i>t̤āriq</i>)
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;272b.</span>land, water, tree, rock, people and horde, opinion and custom.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>d. Of the northern mountains.</i>)</p>

<p>After crossing the Sind-river (eastwards), there are countries,
in the northern mountains mentioned above, appertaining to
Kashmīr and once included in it, although most of them, as for
example, Paklī and Shahmang (?), do not now obey it. Beyond
Kashmīr there are countless peoples and hordes, <i>parganas</i> and
cultivated lands, in the mountains. As far as Bengal, as far
indeed as the shore of the great ocean, the peoples are without
break. About this procession of men no-one has been able
to give authentic information in reply to our enquiries and
investigations. So far people have been saying that they call
these hill-men Kas.<a name="FNanchor_1723" id="FNanchor_1723"></a><a href="#Footnote_1723" class="fnanchor">1723</a> It has struck me that as a Hindūstānī
pronounces <i>shīn</i> as <i>sīn</i> (<i>i.e.</i> <i>sh</i> as <i>s</i>), and as Kashmīr is the one
respectable town in these mountains, no other indeed being
heard of, Hindūstānīs might pronounce it Kasmīr.<a name="FNanchor_1724" id="FNanchor_1724"></a><a href="#Footnote_1724" class="fnanchor">1724</a> These
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span>people trade in musk-bags, <i>b:ḥrī-qūt̤ās</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1725" id="FNanchor_1725"></a><a href="#Footnote_1725" class="fnanchor">1725</a> saffron, lead and
copper.</p>

<p>Hindīs call these mountains Sawālak-parbat. In the Hindī
tongue <i>sawāī-lak</i> means one lak and a quarter, that is, 125,000,
and <i>parbat</i> means a hill, which makes 125,000 hills.<a name="FNanchor_1726" id="FNanchor_1726"></a><a href="#Footnote_1726" class="fnanchor">1726</a> The snow
on these mountains never lessens; it is seen white from many
districts of Hind, as, for example, Lāhor, Sihrind and Saṃbal.
The range, which in Kābul is known as Hindū-kush, comes from
Kābul eastwards into Hindūstān, with slight inclination to the
south. The Hindūstānāt<a name="FNanchor_1727" id="FNanchor_1727"></a><a href="#Footnote_1727" class="fnanchor">1727</a> are to the south of it. Tībet lies to
the north of it and of that unknown horde called Kas.<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;273.</span></p>

<p class="indent">(<i>e. Of rivers.</i>)</p>

<p>Many rivers rise in these mountains and flow through Hindūstān.
Six rise north of Sihrind, namely Sind, Bahat (Jīlam),
Chān-āb [<i>sic</i>], Rāwī, Bīāh, and Sutluj<a name="FNanchor_1728" id="FNanchor_1728"></a><a href="#Footnote_1728" class="fnanchor">1728</a>; all meet near Multān,
flow westwards under the name of Sind, pass through the Tatta
country and fall into the ‘Umān(-sea).</p>

<p>Besides these six there are others, such as Jūn (Jumna), Gang
(Ganges), Rahap (Raptī?), Gūmtī, Gagar (Ghaggar), Sirū, Gandak,
and many more; all unite with the Gang-daryā, flow east under
its name, pass through the Bengal country, and are poured into
the great ocean. They all rise in the Sawālak-parbat.</p>

<p>Many rivers rise in the Hindūstān hills, as, for instance,
Chaṃbal, Banās, Bītwī, and Sūn (Son). There is no snow whatever
on these mountains. Their waters also join the Gang-daryā.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>f. Of the Arāvallī.</i>)</p>

<p>Another Hindūstān range runs north and south. It begins in
the Dihlī country at a small rocky hill on which is Fīrūz Shāh’s
residence, called Jahān-nāma,<a name="FNanchor_1729" id="FNanchor_1729"></a><a href="#Footnote_1729" class="fnanchor">1729</a> and, going on from there, appears
near Dihlī in detached, very low, scattered here and there, rocky
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;273b.</span>little hills.<a name="FNanchor_1730" id="FNanchor_1730"></a><a href="#Footnote_1730" class="fnanchor">1730</a> Beyond Mīwāt, it enters the Bīāna country. The
hills of Sīkrī, Bārī and Dūlpūr are also part of this same including
(tūtā) range. The hills of Gūālīār&mdash;they write it Gālīūr&mdash;although
they do not connect with it, are off-sets of this range; so are the
hills of Rantanbūr, Chitūr, Chandīrī, and Mandāū. They are cut
off from it in some places by 7 to 8 <i>kurohs</i> (14 to 16 m.). These
hills are very low, rough, rocky and jungly. No snow whatever
falls on them. They are the makers, in Hindūstān, of several
rivers.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>g. Irrigation.</i>)</p>

<p>The greater part of the Hindūstān country is situated on level
land. Many though its towns and cultivated lands are, it nowhere
has running waters.<a name="FNanchor_1731" id="FNanchor_1731"></a><a href="#Footnote_1731" class="fnanchor">1731</a> Rivers and, in some places, standing-waters
are its “running-waters” (<i>āqār-sūlār</i>). Even where, as for some
towns, it is practicable to convey water by digging channels (<i>ārīq</i>),
this is not done. For not doing it there may be several reasons,
one being that water is not at all a necessity in cultivating crops
and orchards. Autumn crops grow by the downpour of the rains
themselves; and strange it is that spring crops grow even when
no rain falls. To young trees water is made to flow by means of
buckets or a wheel. They are given water constantly during two
or three years; after which they need no more. Some vegetables
are watered constantly.</p>

<p>In Lāhor, Dībālpūr and those parts, people water by means
of a wheel. They make two circles of ropes long enough to
suit the depth of the well, fix strips of wood between them, and
on these fasten pitchers. The ropes with the wood and attached
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;274.</span>pitchers are put over the well-wheel. At one end of the wheel-axle
a second wheel is fixed, and close (<i>qāsh</i>) to it another on
an upright axle. This last wheel the bullock turns; its teeth
catch in the teeth of the second, and thus the wheel with the
pitchers is turned. A trough is set where the water empties from
the pitchers and from this the water is conveyed everywhere.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span></p>
<p>In Āgra, Chandwār, Bīāna and those parts, again, people
water with a bucket; this is a laborious and filthy way. At the
well-edge they set up a fork of wood, having a roller adjusted
between the forks, tie a rope to a large bucket, put the rope
over the roller, and tie its other end to the bullock. One person
must drive the bullock, another empty the bucket. Every time
the bullock turns after having drawn the bucket out of the well,
that rope lies on the bullock-track, in pollution of urine and
dung, before it descends again into the well. To some crops
needing water, men and women carry it by repeated efforts in
pitchers.<a name="FNanchor_1732" id="FNanchor_1732"></a><a href="#Footnote_1732" class="fnanchor">1732</a></p>

<p class="indent">(<i>h. Other particulars about Hindūstān.</i>)</p>

<p>The towns and country of Hindūstān are greatly wanting in
charm. Its towns and lands are all of one sort; there are no
walls to the orchards (<i>bāghāt</i>), and most places are on the dead
level plain. Under the monsoon-rains the banks of some of its
rivers and torrents are worn into deep channels, difficult and<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;274b.</span>
troublesome to pass through anywhere. In many parts of the
plains thorny jungle grows, behind the good defence of which
the people of the <i>pargana</i> become stubbornly rebellious and pay
no taxes.</p>

<p>Except for the rivers and here and there standing-waters,
there is little “running-water”. So much so is this that towns
and countries subsist on the water of wells or on such as collects
in tanks during the rains.</p>

<p>In Hindūstān hamlets and villages, towns indeed, are
depopulated and set up in a moment! If the people of a large
town, one inhabited for years even, flee from it, they do it in
such a way that not a sign or trace of them remains in a day or
a day and a half.<a name="FNanchor_1733" id="FNanchor_1733"></a><a href="#Footnote_1733" class="fnanchor">1733</a> On the other hand, if they fix their eyes on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span>a place in which to settle, they need not dig water-courses or
construct dams because their crops are all rain-grown,<a name="FNanchor_1734" id="FNanchor_1734"></a><a href="#Footnote_1734" class="fnanchor">1734</a> and as
the population of Hindūstān is unlimited, it swarms in. They
make a tank or dig a well; they need not build houses or set
up walls&mdash;<i>khas</i>-grass (<i>Andropogon muricatum</i>) abounds, wood
is unlimited, huts are made, and straightway there is a village
or a town!</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>i. Fauna of Hindūstān:&mdash;Mammals.</i>)</p>

<p>The elephant, which Hindūstānīs call <i>hāt(h)ī</i>, is one of the
wild animals peculiar to Hindūstān. It inhabits the (western?)
borders of the Kālpī country, and becomes more numerous in
its wild state the further east one goes (in Kālpī?). From this
tract it is that captured elephants are brought; in Karrah and
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;275.</span>Mānikpūr elephant-catching is the work of 30 or 40 villages.<a name="FNanchor_1735" id="FNanchor_1735"></a><a href="#Footnote_1735" class="fnanchor">1735</a>

The elephant is an immense animal and very sagacious. If
people speak to it, it understands; if they command anything
from it, it does it. Its value is according to its size; it is sold
by measure (<i>qārīlāb</i>); the larger it is, the higher its price. People
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span>rumour that it is heard of in some islands as 10 <i>qārī</i><a name="FNanchor_1737" id="FNanchor_1737"></a><a href="#Footnote_1737" class="fnanchor">1737</a> high, but
in this tract it<a name="FNanchor_1738" id="FNanchor_1738"></a><a href="#Footnote_1738" class="fnanchor">1738</a> is not seen above 4 or 5. It eats and drinks
entirely with its trunk; if it lose the trunk, it cannot live. It
has two great teeth (tusks) in its upper jaw, one on each side of
its trunk; by setting these against walls and trees, it brings
them down; with these it fights and does whatever hard tasks
fall to it. People call these ivory (<i>‘āj</i>, var. <i>ghāj</i>); they are highly
valued by Hindūstānīs. The elephant has no hair.<a name="FNanchor_1739" id="FNanchor_1739"></a><a href="#Footnote_1739" class="fnanchor">1739</a> It is much
relied on by Hindūstānīs, accompanying every troop of their
armies. It has some useful qualities:&mdash;it crosses great rivers
with ease, carrying a mass of baggage, and three or four have
gone dragging without trouble the cart of the mortar (<i>qazān</i>) it
takes four or five hundred men to haul.<a name="FNanchor_1740" id="FNanchor_1740"></a><a href="#Footnote_1740" class="fnanchor">1740</a> But its stomach is
large; one elephant eats the corn (<i>būghūz</i>) of two strings (<i>qit̤ār</i>)
of camels.<a name="FNanchor_1741" id="FNanchor_1741"></a><a href="#Footnote_1741" class="fnanchor">1741</a></p>

<p>The rhinoceros is another. This also is a large animal, equal<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;275b.</span>
in bulk to perhaps three buffaloes. The opinion current in those
countries (Tramontana) that it can lift an elephant on its horn,
seems mistaken. It has a single horn on its nose, more than
nine inches (<i>qārīsh</i>) long; one of two <i>qārīsh</i> is not seen.<a name="FNanchor_1742" id="FNanchor_1742"></a><a href="#Footnote_1742" class="fnanchor">1742</a> Out
of one large horn were made a drinking-vessel<a name="FNanchor_1743" id="FNanchor_1743"></a><a href="#Footnote_1743" class="fnanchor">1743</a> and a dice-box,
leaving over [the thickness of] 3 or 4 hands.<a name="FNanchor_1744" id="FNanchor_1744"></a><a href="#Footnote_1744" class="fnanchor">1744</a> The rhinoceros’
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>hide is very thick; an arrow shot from a stiff bow, drawn with
full strength right up to the arm-pit, if it pierce at all, might
penetrate 4 inches (<i>aīlīk</i>, hands). From the sides (<i>qāsh</i>) of its
fore and hind legs,<a name="FNanchor_1745" id="FNanchor_1745"></a><a href="#Footnote_1745" class="fnanchor">1745</a> folds hang which from a distance look like
housings thrown over it. It resembles the horse more than it
does any other animal.<a name="FNanchor_1746" id="FNanchor_1746"></a><a href="#Footnote_1746" class="fnanchor">1746</a> As the horse has a small stomach
(appetite?), so has the rhinoceros; as in the horse a piece of
bone (pastern?) grows in place of small bones (T. <i>āshūq</i>, Fr.
<i>osselets</i> (Zenker), knuckles), so one grows in the rhinoceros; as
in the horse’s hand (<i>aīlīk</i>, Pers. <i>dast</i>) there is <i>kūmūk</i> (or <i>gūmūk</i>,
a <i>tibia</i>, or marrow), so there is in the rhinoceros.<a name="FNanchor_1747" id="FNanchor_1747"></a><a href="#Footnote_1747" class="fnanchor">1747</a> It is more
ferocious than the elephant and cannot be made obedient and
submissive. There are masses of it in the Parashāwar and
Hashnagar jungles, so too between the Sind-river and the jungles
of the Bhīra country. Masses there are also on the banks of
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;276.</span>the Sārū-river in Hindūstān. Some were killed in the Parashāwar
and Hashnagar jungles in our moves on Hindūstān. It strikes
powerfully with its horn; men and horses enough have been
horned in those hunts.<a name="FNanchor_1748" id="FNanchor_1748"></a><a href="#Footnote_1748" class="fnanchor">1748</a> In one of them the horse of a <i>chuhra</i>
(brave) named Maqṣūd was tossed a spear’s-length, for which
reason the man was nick-named the rhino’s aim (<i>maqṣūd-i-karg</i>).</p>

<p>The wild-buffalo<a name="FNanchor_1749" id="FNanchor_1749"></a><a href="#Footnote_1749" class="fnanchor">1749</a> is another. It is much larger than the
(domestic) buffalo and its horns do not turn back in the same
way.<a name="FNanchor_1750" id="FNanchor_1750"></a><a href="#Footnote_1750" class="fnanchor">1750</a> It is a mightily destructive and ferocious animal.</p>

<p>The <i>nīla-gāū</i> (blue-bull)<a name="FNanchor_1751" id="FNanchor_1751"></a><a href="#Footnote_1751" class="fnanchor">1751</a> is another. It may stand as high
as a horse but is somewhat lighter in build. The male is bluish-gray,
hence, seemingly, people call it nīla-gāū. It has two
rather small horns. On its throat is a tuft of hair, nine inches
long; (in this) it resembles the yak.<a name="FNanchor_1752" id="FNanchor_1752"></a><a href="#Footnote_1752" class="fnanchor">1752</a> Its hoof is cleft (<i>aīrī</i>)
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span>like the hoof of cattle. The doe is of the colour of the <i>būghū-marāl</i><a name="FNanchor_1753" id="FNanchor_1753"></a><a href="#Footnote_1753" class="fnanchor">1753</a>;
she, for her part, has no horns and is plumper than
the male.</p>

<p>The hog-deer (<i>kotah-pāīcha</i>) is another.<a name="FNanchor_1754" id="FNanchor_1754"></a><a href="#Footnote_1754" class="fnanchor">1754</a> It may be of the
size of the white deer (<i>āq kiyīk</i>). It has short legs, hence its
name, little-legged. Its horns are like a <i>būghū</i>’s but smaller;
like the <i>būghū</i> it casts them every year. Being rather a poor
runner, it does not leave the jungle.</p>

<p>Another is a deer (<i>kiyīk</i>) after the fashion of the male deer
(<i>aīrkākī hūna</i>) of the <i>jīrān</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1755" id="FNanchor_1755"></a><a href="#Footnote_1755" class="fnanchor">1755</a> Its back is black, its belly white, its
horns longer than the <i>hūna’s</i>, but more crooked. A Hindūstānī<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;276b.</span>
calls it <i>kalahara</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1756" id="FNanchor_1756"></a><a href="#Footnote_1756" class="fnanchor">1756</a> a word which may have been originally <i>kālā-haran</i>,
black-buck, and which has been softened in pronunciation
to <i>kalahara</i>. The doe is light-coloured. By means of this
<i>kalahara</i> people catch deer; they fasten a noose (<i>ḥalqa</i>) on its
horns, hang a stone as large as a ball<a name="FNanchor_1757" id="FNanchor_1757"></a><a href="#Footnote_1757" class="fnanchor">1757</a> on one of its feet, so as
to keep it from getting far away after it has brought about the
capture of a deer, and set it opposite wild deer when these
are seen. As these (<i>kalahara</i>) deer are singularly combative,
advance to fight is made at once. The two deer strike with
their horns and push one another backwards and forwards,
during which the wild one’s horns become entangled in the net
that is fast to the tame one’s. If the wild one would run away,
the tame one does not go; it is impeded also by the stone on
its foot. People take many deer in this way; after capture they
tame them and use them in their turn to take others;<a name="FNanchor_1758" id="FNanchor_1758"></a><a href="#Footnote_1758" class="fnanchor">1758</a> they
also set them to fight at home; the deer fight very well.</p>

<p>There is a smaller deer (<i>kiyīk</i>) on the Hindūstān hill-skirts,
as large may-be as the one year’s lamb of the <i>arqārghalcha</i>
(<i>Ovis poli</i>).</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>gīnī-cow</i><a name="FNanchor_1759" id="FNanchor_1759"></a><a href="#Footnote_1759" class="fnanchor">1759</a> is another, a very small one, perhaps as large
as the <i>qūchqār</i> (ram) of those countries (Tramontana). Its flesh
is very tender and savoury.</p>

<p>The monkey (<i>maimūn</i>) is another&mdash;a Hindūstānī calls it
<i>bandar</i>. Of this too there are many kinds, one being what people
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;277.</span>take to those countries. The jugglers (<i>lūlī</i>) teach them tricks.
This kind is in the mountains of Nūr-dara, in the skirt-hills of
Safīd-koh neighbouring on Khaibar, and from there downwards
all through Hindūstān. It is not found higher up. Its hair is
yellow, its face white, its tail not very long.&mdash;Another kind, not
found in Bajaur, Sawād and those parts, is much larger than the
one taken to those countries (Tramontana). Its tail is very
long, its hair whitish, its face quite black. It is in the mountains
and jungles of Hindūstān.<a name="FNanchor_1760" id="FNanchor_1760"></a><a href="#Footnote_1760" class="fnanchor">1760</a>&mdash;Yet another kind is distinguished
(<i>būlā dūr</i>), quite black in hair, face and limbs.<a name="FNanchor_1761" id="FNanchor_1761"></a><a href="#Footnote_1761" class="fnanchor">1761</a></p>

<p>The <i>nawal</i> (<i>nūl</i>)<a name="FNanchor_1762" id="FNanchor_1762"></a><a href="#Footnote_1762" class="fnanchor">1762</a> is another. It may be somewhat smaller
than the <i>kīsh</i>. It climbs trees. Some call it the <i>mūsh-i-khūrma</i>
(palm-rat). It is thought lucky.</p>

<p>A mouse (T. <i>sīchqān</i>) people call <i>galāhrī</i> (squirrel) is another.
It is just always in trees, running up and down with amazing
alertness and speed.<a name="FNanchor_1763" id="FNanchor_1763"></a><a href="#Footnote_1763" class="fnanchor">1763</a></p>

<p class="indent">(<i>j. Fauna of Hindūstān:&mdash;Birds.</i>)<a name="FNanchor_1764" id="FNanchor_1764"></a><a href="#Footnote_1764" class="fnanchor">1764</a></p>

<p>The peacock (Ar. <i>t̤āūs</i>) is one. It is a beautifully coloured and
splendid animal. Its form (<i>andām</i>) is not equal to its colouring
and beauty. Its body may be as large as the crane’s (<i>tūrna</i>)
but it is not so tall. On the head of both cock and hen are 20
to 30 feathers rising some 2 or 3 inches high. The hen has
neither colour nor beauty. The head of the cock has an
iridescent collar (<i>t̤auq sūsanī</i>); its neck is of a beautiful blue;<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;277b.</span>
below the neck, its back is painted in yellow, parrot-green, blue
and violet colours. The flowers<a name="FNanchor_1765" id="FNanchor_1765"></a><a href="#Footnote_1765" class="fnanchor">1765</a> on its back are much the
smaller; below the back as far as the tail-tips are [larger] flowers
painted in the same colours. The tail of some peacocks grows
to the length of a man’s extended arms.<a name="FNanchor_1766" id="FNanchor_1766"></a><a href="#Footnote_1766" class="fnanchor">1766</a> It has a small tail
under its flowered feathers, like the tail of other birds; this
ordinary tail and its primaries<a name="FNanchor_1767" id="FNanchor_1767"></a><a href="#Footnote_1767" class="fnanchor">1767</a> are red. It is in Bajaur and
Sawād and below them; it is not in Kunur [Kūnūr] and the
Lamghānāt or any place above them. Its flight is feebler than
the pheasant’s (<i>qīrghāwal</i>); it cannot do more than make one
or two short flights.<a name="FNanchor_1768" id="FNanchor_1768"></a><a href="#Footnote_1768" class="fnanchor">1768</a> On account of its feeble flight, it frequents
the hills or jungles, which is curious, since jackals abound in the
jungles it frequents. What damage might these jackals not do
to birds that trail from jungle to jungle, tails as long as a man’s
stretch (<i>qūlāch</i>)! Hindūstānīs call the peacock <i>mor</i>. Its flesh
is lawful food, according to the doctrine of Imām Abū Ḥanīfa;
it is like that of the partridge and not unsavoury, but is eaten
with instinctive aversion, in the way camel-flesh is.</p>

<p>The parrot (H. <i>t̤ūt̤ī</i>) is another. This also is in Bajaur
and countries lower down. It comes into Nīngnahār and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span>Lamghānāt in the heats when mulberries ripen; it is not there
at other times. It is of many, many kinds. One sort is that
which people carry into those (Tramontane) countries. They
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;278.</span>make it speak words.&mdash;Another sort is smaller; this also they
make speak words. They call it the jungle-parrot. It is
numerous in Bajaur, Sawād and that neighbourhood, so much
so that 5 or 6000 fly in one flock (<i>khail</i>). Between it and the
one first-named the difference is in bulk; in colouring they are
just one and the same.&mdash;Another sort is still smaller than the
jungle-parrot. Its head is quite red, the top of its wings (<i>i.e.</i> the
primaries) is red also; the tip of its tail for two hands'-thickness
is lustrous.<a name="FNanchor_1769" id="FNanchor_1769"></a><a href="#Footnote_1769" class="fnanchor">1769</a> The head of some parrots of this kind is iridescent
(<i>sūsanī</i>). It does not become a talker. People call it the
Kashmīr parrot.&mdash;Another sort is rather smaller than the jungle-parrot;
its beak is black; round its neck is a wide black collar;
its primaries are red. It is an excellent learner of words.&mdash;We
used to think that whatever a parrot or a <i>shārak</i> (<i>mīna</i>) might say
of words people had taught it, it could not speak of any matter
out of its own head. At this juncture<a name="FNanchor_1770" id="FNanchor_1770"></a><a href="#Footnote_1770" class="fnanchor">1770</a> one of my immediate
servants Abū’l-qāsim <i>Jalāīr</i>, reported a singular thing to me.
A parrot of this sort whose cage must have been covered up,
said, “Uncover my face; I am stifling.” And another time
when palkī bearers sat down to take breath, this parrot,
presumably on hearing wayfarers pass by, said, “Men are going
past, are you not going on?” Let credit rest with the narrator,<a name="FNanchor_1771" id="FNanchor_1771"></a><a href="#Footnote_1771" class="fnanchor">1771</a>
but never-the-less, so long as a person has not heard with his
own ears, he may not believe!&mdash;Another kind is of a beautiful
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;278b.</span>full red; it has other colours also, but, as nothing is distinctly
remembered about them, no description is made. It is a very
beautiful bird, both in colour and form. People are understood
to make this also speak words.<a name="FNanchor_1772" id="FNanchor_1772"></a><a href="#Footnote_1772" class="fnanchor">1772</a> Its defect is a most unpleasant,
sharp voice, like the drawing of broken china on a copper plate.<a name="FNanchor_1773" id="FNanchor_1773"></a><a href="#Footnote_1773" class="fnanchor">1773</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span></p>
<p>The (P.) <i>shārak</i><a name="FNanchor_1774" id="FNanchor_1774"></a><a href="#Footnote_1774" class="fnanchor">1774</a> is another. It is numerous in the Lamghānāt
and abounds lower down, all over Hindūstān. Like the parrot,
it is of many kinds.&mdash;The kind that is numerous in the Lamghānāt
has a black head; its primaries (<i>qānāt</i>) are spotted, its
body rather larger and thicker<a name="FNanchor_1775" id="FNanchor_1775"></a><a href="#Footnote_1775" class="fnanchor">1775</a> than that of the (T.) <i>chūghūr-chūq</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1776" id="FNanchor_1776"></a><a href="#Footnote_1776" class="fnanchor">1776</a>
People teach it to speak words.&mdash;Another kind they
call <i>p:ndāwalī</i><a name="FNanchor_1777" id="FNanchor_1777"></a><a href="#Footnote_1777" class="fnanchor">1777</a>; they bring it from Bengal; it is black all
over and of much greater bulk than the <i>shārak</i> (here, house-<i>mīna</i>).
Its bill and foot are yellow and on each ear are
yellow wattles which hang down and have a bad appearance.<a name="FNanchor_1778" id="FNanchor_1778"></a><a href="#Footnote_1778" class="fnanchor">1778</a>
It learns to speak well and clearly.&mdash;Another kind of <i>shārak</i>
is slenderer than the last and is red round the eyes. It
does not learn to speak. People call it the wood-<i>shārak</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1779" id="FNanchor_1779"></a><a href="#Footnote_1779" class="fnanchor">1779</a>
Again, at the time when (934 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>) I had made a bridge over
Gang (Ganges), crossed it, and put my adversaries to flight,
a kind of <i>shārak</i> was seen, in the neighbourhood of Laknau
and Aūd (Oude), for the first time, which had a white breast,
piebald head, and black back. This kind does not learn to
speak.<a name="FNanchor_1780" id="FNanchor_1780"></a><a href="#Footnote_1780" class="fnanchor">1780</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</a></span></p>
<p>The <i>lūja</i><a name="FNanchor_1781" id="FNanchor_1781"></a><a href="#Footnote_1781" class="fnanchor">1781</a> is another. This bird they call (Ar.) <i>bū-qalamūn</i>
(chameleon) because, between head and tail, it has five or six
changing colours, resplendent (<i>barrāq</i>) like a pigeon’s throat.
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;279.</span>It is about as large as the <i>kabg-i-darī</i><a name="FNanchor_1782" id="FNanchor_1782"></a><a href="#Footnote_1782" class="fnanchor">1782</a> and seems to be the
<i>kabg-i-darī</i> of Hindūstān. As the <i>kabg-i-darī</i> moves (<i>yūrūr</i>)
on the heads (<i>kulah</i>) of mountains, so does this. It is in the
Nijr-aū mountains of the countries of Kābul, and in the
mountains lower down but it is not found higher up. People
tell this wonderful thing about it:&mdash;When the birds, at the
onset of winter, descend to the hill-skirts, if they come over
a vineyard, they can fly no further and are taken. God knows
the truth! The flesh of this bird is very savoury.</p>

<p>The partridge (<i>durrāj</i>)<a name="FNanchor_1783" id="FNanchor_1783"></a><a href="#Footnote_1783" class="fnanchor">1783</a> is another. This is not peculiar to
Hindūstān but is also in the <i>Garm-sīr</i> countries<a name="FNanchor_1784" id="FNanchor_1784"></a><a href="#Footnote_1784" class="fnanchor">1784</a>; as however
some kinds are only in Hindūstān, particulars of them are given
here. The <i>durrāj</i> (<i>Francolinus vulgaris</i>) may be of the same
bulk as the <i>kīklīk</i><a name="FNanchor_1785" id="FNanchor_1785"></a><a href="#Footnote_1785" class="fnanchor">1785</a>; the cock’s back is the colour of the hen-pheasant
(<i>qīrghāwal-ning māda-sī</i>); its throat and breast are
black, with quite white spots.<a name="FNanchor_1786" id="FNanchor_1786"></a><a href="#Footnote_1786" class="fnanchor">1786</a> A red line comes down on both
sides of both eyes.<a name="FNanchor_1787" id="FNanchor_1787"></a><a href="#Footnote_1787" class="fnanchor">1787</a> It is named from its cry<a name="FNanchor_1788" id="FNanchor_1788"></a><a href="#Footnote_1788" class="fnanchor">1788</a> which is something
like <i>Shir dāram shakrak</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1789" id="FNanchor_1789"></a><a href="#Footnote_1789" class="fnanchor">1789</a> It pronounces <i>shir</i> short;
<i>dāram shakrak</i> it says distinctly. Astarābād partridges are said
to cry <i>Bāt mīnī tūtīlār</i> (Quick! they have caught me). The
partridge of Arabia and those parts is understood to cry, <i>Bi’l</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span><i>shakar tadawm al ni‘am</i> (with sugar pleasure endures)! The
hen-bird has the colour of the young pheasant. These birds
are found below Nijr-aū.&mdash;Another kind is called <i>kanjāl</i>. Its
bulk may be that of the one already described. Its voice is
very like that of the <i>kīklīk</i> but much shriller. There is little<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;279b.</span>
difference in colour between the cock and hen. It is found in
Parashāwar, Hashnagar and countries lower down, but not
higher up.</p>

<p>The <i>p(h)ūl-paikār</i><a name="FNanchor_1790" id="FNanchor_1790"></a><a href="#Footnote_1790" class="fnanchor">1790</a> is another. Its size may be that of the
<i>kabg-i-darī</i>; its shape is that of the house-cock, its colour that
of the hen. From forehead (<i>tūmāgh</i>) to throat it is of a beautiful
colour, quite red. It is in the Hindūstān mountains.</p>

<p>The wild-fowl (<i>ṣaḥrāī-tāūgh</i>)<a name="FNanchor_1791" id="FNanchor_1791"></a><a href="#Footnote_1791" class="fnanchor">1791</a> is another. It flies like a
pheasant, and is not of all colours as house-fowl are. It is in
the mountains of Bajaur and lower down, but not higher up.</p>

<p>The <i>chīlsī</i> (or <i>jīlsī</i>)<a name="FNanchor_1792" id="FNanchor_1792"></a><a href="#Footnote_1792" class="fnanchor">1792</a> is another. In bulk it equals the <i>p(h)ūl-paikār</i>
but the latter has the finer colouring. It is in the
mountains of Bajaur.</p>

<p>The <i>shām</i><a name="FNanchor_1793" id="FNanchor_1793"></a><a href="#Footnote_1793" class="fnanchor">1793</a> is another. It is about as large as a house-fowl;
its colour is unique (<i>ghair mukarrar</i>).<a name="FNanchor_1794" id="FNanchor_1794"></a><a href="#Footnote_1794" class="fnanchor">1794</a> It also is in the mountains
of Bajaur.</p>

<p>The quail (P. <i>būdana</i>) is another. It is not peculiar to Hindūstān
but four or five kinds are so.&mdash;One is that which goes to our
countries (Tramontana), larger and more spreading than the
(Hindūstān) quail.<a name="FNanchor_1795" id="FNanchor_1795"></a><a href="#Footnote_1795" class="fnanchor">1795</a>&mdash;Another kind<a name="FNanchor_1796" id="FNanchor_1796"></a><a href="#Footnote_1796" class="fnanchor">1796</a> is smaller than the one first
named. Its primaries and tail are reddish. It flies in flocks
like the <i>chīr</i> (<i>Phasianus Wallichii</i>).&mdash;Another kind is smaller
than that which goes to our countries and is darker on throat
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span><span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;280.</span>and breast.<a name="FNanchor_1797" id="FNanchor_1797"></a><a href="#Footnote_1797" class="fnanchor">1797</a>&mdash;Another kind goes in small numbers to Kābul;
it is very small, perhaps a little larger than the yellow wag-tail
(<i>qārcha</i>)<a name="FNanchor_1798" id="FNanchor_1798"></a><a href="#Footnote_1798" class="fnanchor">1798</a>; they call it <i>qūrātū</i> in Kābul.</p>

<p>The Indian bustard (P. <i>kharchāl</i>)<a name="FNanchor_1799" id="FNanchor_1799"></a><a href="#Footnote_1799" class="fnanchor">1799</a> is another. It is about as
large as the (T.) <i>tūghdāq</i> (<i>Otis tarda</i>, the great bustard), and seems
to be the <i>tūghdāq</i> of Hindūstān.<a name="FNanchor_1800" id="FNanchor_1800"></a><a href="#Footnote_1800" class="fnanchor">1800</a> Its flesh is delicious; of some
birds the leg is good, of others, the wing; of the bustard all the
meat is delicious and excellent.</p>

<p>The florican (P. <i>charz</i>)<a name="FNanchor_1801" id="FNanchor_1801"></a><a href="#Footnote_1801" class="fnanchor">1801</a> is another. It is rather less than the
<i>tūghdīrī</i> (<i>houbara</i>)<a name="FNanchor_1802" id="FNanchor_1802"></a><a href="#Footnote_1802" class="fnanchor">1802</a>; the cock’s back is like the <i>tūghdīrī’s</i>, and
its breast is black. The hen is of one colour.</p>

<p>The Hindūstān sand-grouse (T. <i>bāghrī-qarā</i>)<a name="FNanchor_1803" id="FNanchor_1803"></a><a href="#Footnote_1803" class="fnanchor">1803</a> is another. It is
smaller and slenderer than the <i>bāghrī-qarā</i> [<i>Pterocles arenarius</i>]
of those countries (Tramontana). Also its cry is sharper.</p>

<p>Of the birds that frequent water and the banks of rivers, one
is the <i>dīng</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1804" id="FNanchor_1804"></a><a href="#Footnote_1804" class="fnanchor">1804</a> an animal of great bulk, each wing measuring
a <i>qūlāch</i> (fathom). It has no plumage (<i>tūqī</i>) on head or neck;
a thing like a bag hangs from its neck; its back is black; its
breast is white. It goes sometimes to Kābul; one year people
brought one they had caught. It became very tame; if meat
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span>were thrown to it, it never failed to catch it in its bill. Once it
swallowed a six-nailed shoe, another time a whole fowl, wings<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;280b.</span>
and feathers, all right down.</p>

<p>The <i>sāras</i> (<i>Grus antigone</i>) is another. Turks in Hindūstān
call it <i>tīwa-tūrnā</i> (camel-crane). It may be smaller than the
<i>dīng</i> but its neck is rather longer. Its head is quite red.<a name="FNanchor_1805" id="FNanchor_1805"></a><a href="#Footnote_1805" class="fnanchor">1805</a> People
keep this bird at their houses; it becomes very tame.</p>

<p>The <i>mānek</i><a name="FNanchor_1806" id="FNanchor_1806"></a><a href="#Footnote_1806" class="fnanchor">1806</a> is another. In stature it approaches the <i>sāras</i>,
but its bulk is less. It resembles the <i>lag-lag</i> (<i>Ciconia alba</i>, the
white stork) but is much larger; its bill is larger and is black.
Its head is iridescent, its neck white, its wings partly-coloured;
the tips and border-feathers and under parts of the wings are
white, their middle black.</p>

<p>Another stork (<i>lag-lag</i>) has a white neck and all other parts
black. It goes to those countries (Tramontana). It is rather
smaller than the <i>lag-lag</i> (<i>Ciconia alba</i>). A Hindūstānī calls it
<i>yak-rang</i> (one colour?).</p>

<p>Another stork in colour and shape is exactly like the storks
that go to those countries. Its bill is blacker and its bulk much
less than the <i>lag-lag</i>’s (<i>Ciconia alba</i>).<a name="FNanchor_1807" id="FNanchor_1807"></a><a href="#Footnote_1807" class="fnanchor">1807</a></p>

<p>Another bird resembles the grey heron (<i>aūqār</i>) and the <i>lag-lag</i>;
but its bill is longer than the heron’s and its body smaller
than the white stork’s (<i>lag-lag</i>).</p>

<p>Another is the large <i>buzak</i><a name="FNanchor_1808" id="FNanchor_1808"></a><a href="#Footnote_1808" class="fnanchor">1808</a> (black ibis). In bulk it may
equal the buzzard (Turkī, <i>sār</i>). The back of its wings is white.
It has a loud cry.</p>

<p>The white <i>buzak</i><a name="FNanchor_1809" id="FNanchor_1809"></a><a href="#Footnote_1809" class="fnanchor">1809</a> is another. Its head and bill are black.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span><span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;281.</span>It is much larger than the one that goes to those countries,<a name="FNanchor_1810" id="FNanchor_1810"></a><a href="#Footnote_1810" class="fnanchor">1810</a> but
smaller than the Hindūstān <i>buzak</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1811" id="FNanchor_1811"></a><a href="#Footnote_1811" class="fnanchor">1811</a></p>

<p>The <i>gharm-pāī</i><a name="FNanchor_1812" id="FNanchor_1812"></a><a href="#Footnote_1812" class="fnanchor">1812</a> (spotted-billed duck) is another. It is larger
than the <i>sūna būrchīn</i><a name="FNanchor_1813" id="FNanchor_1813"></a><a href="#Footnote_1813" class="fnanchor">1813</a> (mallard). The drake and duck are of
one colour. It is in Hashnagar at all seasons, sometimes it goes
into the Lamghānāt. Its flesh is very savoury.</p>

<p>The <i>shāh-murgh</i> (<i>Sarcidiornis melanonotus</i>, comb duck or <i>nukta</i>)
is another. It may be a little smaller than a goose. It has a
swelling on its bill; its back is black; its flesh is excellent eating.</p>

<p>The <i>zummaj</i> is another. It is about as large as the <i>būrgūt</i>
(<i>Aquila chrysaetus</i>, the golden eagle).</p>

<p>The (T.) <i>ālā-qārgha</i> of Hindūstān is another (<i>Corvus cornix</i>,
the pied crow). This is slenderer and smaller than the <i>ālā-qārgha</i>
of those countries (Tramontana). Its neck is partly
white.</p>

<p>Another Hindūstān bird resembles the crow (T. <i>qārcha</i>,
<i>C. splendens</i>) and the magpie (Ar. <i>‘aqqa</i>). In the Lamghānāt
people call it the jungle-bird (P. <i>murgh-i-jangal</i>).<a name="FNanchor_1814" id="FNanchor_1814"></a><a href="#Footnote_1814" class="fnanchor">1814</a> Its head
and breast are black; its wings and tail reddish; its eye quite
red. Having a feeble flight, it does not come out of the jungle,
whence its name.</p>

<p>The great bat (P. <i>shapara</i>)<a name="FNanchor_1815" id="FNanchor_1815"></a><a href="#Footnote_1815" class="fnanchor">1815</a> is another. People call it (Hindī)
<i>chumgādur</i>. It is about as large as the owl (T. <i>yāpālāq</i>, <i>Otus
brachyotus</i>), and has a head like a puppy’s. When it is thinking
of lodging for the night on a tree, it takes hold of a branch, turns
head-downwards, and so remains. It has much singularity.</p>

<p>The magpie (Ar. <i>‘aqqa</i>) is another. People call it (H.?) <i>matā</i>
(<i>Dendrocitta rufa</i>, the Indian tree-pie). It may be somewhat
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span>less than the <i>‘aqqa</i> (<i>Pica rustica</i>), which moreover is pied black
and white, while the <i>matā</i> is pied brown and black.<a name="FNanchor_1816" id="FNanchor_1816"></a><a href="#Footnote_1816" class="fnanchor">1816</a></p>

<p>Another is a small bird, perhaps of the size of the (T.) <i>sāndūlāch</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1817" id="FNanchor_1817"></a><a href="#Footnote_1817" class="fnanchor">1817</a><span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;281b.</span>
It is of a beautiful red with a little black on its wings.</p>

<p>The <i>karcha</i><a name="FNanchor_1818" id="FNanchor_1818"></a><a href="#Footnote_1818" class="fnanchor">1818</a> is another; it is after the fashion of a swallow
(T. <i>qārlūghāch</i>), but much larger and quite black.</p>

<p>The <i>kūīl</i><a name="FNanchor_1819" id="FNanchor_1819"></a><a href="#Footnote_1819" class="fnanchor">1819</a> (<i>Eudynamys orientalis</i>, the koel) is another. It may
be as large as the crow (P. <i>zāg</i>) but is much slenderer. It has
a kind of song and is understood to be the bulbul of Hindūstān.
Its honour with Hindūstānīs is as great as is the bulbul’s. It
always stays in closely-wooded gardens.</p>

<p>Another bird is after the fashion of the (Ar.) <i>shiqarrāk</i> (<i>Cissa
chinensis</i>, the green-magpie). It clings to trees, is perhaps as
large as the green-magpie, and is parrot-green (<i>Gecinus striolatus</i>,
the little green-woodpecker?).</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>k. Fauna of Hindūstān:&mdash;Aquatic animals.</i>)</p>

<p>One is the water-tiger (P. <i>shīr-ābī</i>, <i>Crocodilus palustris</i>).<a name="FNanchor_1820" id="FNanchor_1820"></a><a href="#Footnote_1820" class="fnanchor">1820</a> This
is in the standing-waters. It is like a lizard (T. <i>gīlās</i>).<a name="FNanchor_1821" id="FNanchor_1821"></a><a href="#Footnote_1821" class="fnanchor">1821</a> People
say it carries off men and even buffaloes.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span></p>
<p>The (P.) <i>siyāh-sār</i> (black-head) is another. This also is like
a lizard. It is in all rivers of Hindūstān. One that was taken
and brought in was about 4-5 <i>qārī</i> (<i>cir.</i> 13 feet) long and as
thick perhaps as a sheep. It is said to grow still larger. Its
snout is over half a yard long. It has rows of small teeth in its
upper and lower jaws. It comes out of the water and sinks into
the mud (<i>bātā</i>).</p>

<p>The (Sans.) <i>g[h]aṛīāl</i> (<i>Gavialus gangeticus</i>) is another.<a name="FNanchor_1822" id="FNanchor_1822"></a><a href="#Footnote_1822" class="fnanchor">1822</a> It is
said to grow large; many in the army saw it in the Sarū (Gogra)
river. It is said to take people; while we were on that river’s
banks (934-935 <span class="smcap">A.H.</span>), it took one or two slave-women (<i>dādūk</i>),
and it took three or four camp-followers between Ghāzīpūr and
Banāras. In that neighbourhood I saw one but from a distance
only and not quite clearly.</p>

<p>The water-hog (P. <i>khūk-ābī</i>, <i>Platanista gangetica</i>, the porpoise)
is another. This also is in all Hindūstān rivers. It comes up
suddenly out of the water; its head appears and disappears; it
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;282.</span>dives again and stays below, shewing its tail. Its snout is as
long as the <i>siyāh-sār’s</i> and it has the same rows of small teeth.
Its head and the rest of its body are fish-like. When at play in
the water, it looks like a water-carrier’s bag (<i>mashak</i>). Water-hogs,
playing in the Sarū, leap right out of the water; like fish,
they never leave it.</p>

<p>Again there is the <i>kalah</i> (or <i>galah</i>)-fish [<i>bāligh</i>].<a name="FNanchor_1823" id="FNanchor_1823"></a><a href="#Footnote_1823" class="fnanchor">1823</a> Two bones
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span>each about 3 inches (<i>aīlīk</i>) long, come out in a line with its ears;
these it shakes when taken, producing an extraordinary noise,
whence, seemingly, people have called it <i>kalah</i> [or <i>galah</i>].</p>

<p>The flesh of Hindūstān fishes is very savoury; they have no
odour (<i>aīd</i>) or tiresomeness.<a name="FNanchor_1824" id="FNanchor_1824"></a><a href="#Footnote_1824" class="fnanchor">1824</a> They are surprisingly active. On
one occasion when people coming, had flung a net across a stream,
leaving its two edges half a yard above the water, most fish passed
by leaping a yard above it. In many rivers are little fish which
fling themselves a yard or more out of the water if there be harsh<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;282b.</span>
noise or sound of feet.</p>

<p>The frogs of Hindūstān, though otherwise like those others
(Tramontane), run 6 or 7 yards on the face of the water.<a name="FNanchor_1825" id="FNanchor_1825"></a><a href="#Footnote_1825" class="fnanchor">1825</a></p>

<p class="indent">(<i>l. Vegetable products of Hindūstān: Fruits.</i>)</p>

<p>The mango (P. <i>anbah</i>) is one of the fruits peculiar to Hindūstān.
Hindūstānīs pronounce the <i>b</i> in its name as though no vowel
followed it (<i>i.e.</i> Sans. <i>anb</i>);<a name="FNanchor_1826" id="FNanchor_1826"></a><a href="#Footnote_1826" class="fnanchor">1826</a> this being awkward to utter, some
people call the fruit [P.] <i>naghzak</i><a name="FNanchor_1827" id="FNanchor_1827"></a><a href="#Footnote_1827" class="fnanchor">1827</a> as Khwāja Khusrau does:&mdash;</p>

<p>Mangoes when good, are very good, but, many as are eaten, few
are first-rate. They are usually plucked unripe and ripened in
the house. Unripe, they make excellent condiments (<i>qātīq</i>), are
good also preserved in syrup.<a name="FNanchor_1829" id="FNanchor_1829"></a><a href="#Footnote_1829" class="fnanchor">1829</a> Taking it altogether, the mango
is the best fruit of Hindūstān. Some so praise it as to give it
preference over all fruits except the musk-melon (T. <i>qāwūn</i>), but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span>such praise outmatches it. It resembles the <i>kārdī</i> peach.<a name="FNanchor_1830" id="FNanchor_1830"></a><a href="#Footnote_1830" class="fnanchor">1830</a> It
ripens in the rains. It is eaten in two ways: one is to squeeze
it to a pulp, make a hole in it, and suck out the juice,&mdash;the other,
to peel and eat it like the <i>kārdī</i> peach. Its tree grows very large<a name="FNanchor_1831" id="FNanchor_1831"></a><a href="#Footnote_1831" class="fnanchor">1831</a>
and has a leaf somewhat resembling the peach-tree’s. The
trunk is ill-looking and ill-shaped, but in Bengāl and Gujrāt is
heard of as growing handsome (<i>khūb</i>).<a name="FNanchor_1832" id="FNanchor_1832"></a><a href="#Footnote_1832" class="fnanchor">1832</a></p>

<p>The plantain (Sans. <i>kelā</i>, <i>Musa sapientum</i>) is another.<a name="FNanchor_1833" id="FNanchor_1833"></a><a href="#Footnote_1833" class="fnanchor">1833</a> An
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;283.</span>‘Arab calls it <i>mauz</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1834" id="FNanchor_1834"></a><a href="#Footnote_1834" class="fnanchor">1834</a> Its tree is not very tall, indeed is not to
be called a tree, since it is something between a grass and a tree.
Its leaf is a little like that of the <i>amān-qarā</i><a name="FNanchor_1835" id="FNanchor_1835"></a><a href="#Footnote_1835" class="fnanchor">1835</a> but grows about
2 yards (<i>qārī</i>]) long and nearly one broad. Out of the middle of
its leaves rises, heart-like, a bud which resembles a sheep’s heart.
As each leaf (petal) of this bud expands, there grows at its base
a row of 6 or 7 flowers which become the plantains. These
flowers become visible with the lengthening of the heart-like
shoot and the opening of the petals of the bud. The tree is
understood to flower once only.<a name="FNanchor_1836" id="FNanchor_1836"></a><a href="#Footnote_1836" class="fnanchor">1836</a> The fruit has two pleasant
qualities, one that it peels easily, the other that it has neither stone
nor fibre.<a name="FNanchor_1837" id="FNanchor_1837"></a><a href="#Footnote_1837" class="fnanchor">1837</a> It is rather longer and thinner than the egg-plant
(P. <i>bādanjān</i>; <i>Solanum melongena</i>). It is not very sweet; the
Bengāl plantain (<i>i.e.</i> <i>chīnī-champa</i>) is, however, said to be very
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span>sweet. The plantain is a very good-looking tree, its broad,
broad, leaves of beautiful green having an excellent appearance.</p>

<p>The <i>anblī</i> (H. <i>imlī</i>, <i>Tamarindus indica</i>, the tamarind) is
another. By this name (<i>anblī</i>) people call the <i>khurmā-i-hind</i>
(Indian date-tree).<a name="FNanchor_1838" id="FNanchor_1838"></a><a href="#Footnote_1838" class="fnanchor">1838</a> It has finely-cut leaves (leaflets), precisely

It is a very good-looking tree, giving dense shade. It grows wild
in masses too.</p>

<p>The (Beng.) <i>mahuwā</i> (<i>Bassia latifolia</i>) is another.<a name="FNanchor_1840" id="FNanchor_1840"></a><a href="#Footnote_1840" class="fnanchor">1840</a> People
call it also (P.) <i>gul-chikān</i> (or <i>chigān</i>, distilling-flower). This also
is a very large tree. Most of the wood in the houses of Hindūstānīs<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;283b.</span>
is from it. Spirit (<i>‘araq</i>) is distilled from its flowers,<a name="FNanchor_1841" id="FNanchor_1841"></a><a href="#Footnote_1841" class="fnanchor">1841</a> not
only so, but they are dried and eaten like raisins, and from them
thus dried, spirit is also extracted. The dried flowers taste just
like <i>kishmish</i>;<a name="FNanchor_1842" id="FNanchor_1842"></a><a href="#Footnote_1842" class="fnanchor">1842</a> they have an ill-flavour. The flowers are not bad
in their natural state<a name="FNanchor_1843" id="FNanchor_1843"></a><a href="#Footnote_1843" class="fnanchor">1843</a>; they are eatable. The <i>mahuwā</i> grows
wild also. Its fruit is tasteless, has rather a large seed with a
thin husk, and from this seed, again,<a name="FNanchor_1844" id="FNanchor_1844"></a><a href="#Footnote_1844" class="fnanchor">1844</a> oil is extracted.</p>

<p>The mimusops (Sans. <i>khirnī</i>, <i>Mimusops kauki</i>) is another. Its
tree, though not very large, is not small. The fruit is yellow and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span>thinner than the red jujube (T. <i>chīkdā</i>, <i>Elæagnus angustifolia</i>).
It has just the grape’s flavour, but a rather bad after-taste; it
is not bad, however, and is eatable. The husk of its stoneæ
is thin.</p>

<p>The (Sans.) <i>jāman</i> (<i>Eugenia jambolana</i>)<a name="FNanchor_1845" id="FNanchor_1845"></a><a href="#Footnote_1845" class="fnanchor">1845</a> is another. Its leaf,
except for being thicker and greener, is quite like the willow’s
(T. <i>tāl</i>). The tree does not want for beauty. Its fruit is like
a black grape, is sourish, and not very good.</p>

<p>The (H.) <i>kamrak</i> (Beng. <i>kamrunga</i>, <i>Averrhoa carambola</i>) is
another. Its fruit is five-sided, about as large as the <i>‘ain-ālū</i><a name="FNanchor_1846" id="FNanchor_1846"></a><a href="#Footnote_1846" class="fnanchor">1846</a>
and some 3 inches long. It ripens to yellow; gathered unripe,
it is very bitter; gathered ripe, its bitterness has become sub-acid,
not bad, not wanting in pleasantness.<a name="FNanchor_1847" id="FNanchor_1847"></a><a href="#Footnote_1847" class="fnanchor">1847</a></p>

<p>The jack-fruit (H. <i>kadhil</i>, B. <i>kanthal</i>, <i>Artocarpus integrifolia</i>)
is another.<a name="FNanchor_1848" id="FNanchor_1848"></a><a href="#Footnote_1848" class="fnanchor">1848</a> This is a fruit of singular form and flavour; it looks
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;284.</span>like a sheep’s stomach stuffed and made into a haggis (<i>gīpa</i>);<a name="FNanchor_1849" id="FNanchor_1849"></a><a href="#Footnote_1849" class="fnanchor">1849</a>
and it is sickeningly-sweet. Inside it are filbert-like stones<a name="FNanchor_1850" id="FNanchor_1850"></a><a href="#Footnote_1850" class="fnanchor">1850</a>
which, on the whole, resemble dates, but are round, not long,
and have softer substance; these are eaten. The jack-fruit is
very adhesive; for this reason people are said to oil mouth and
hands before eating of it. It is heard of also as growing, not
only on the branches of its tree, but on trunk and root too.<a name="FNanchor_1851" id="FNanchor_1851"></a><a href="#Footnote_1851" class="fnanchor">1851</a> One
would say that the tree was all hung round with haggises.<a name="FNanchor_1852" id="FNanchor_1852"></a><a href="#Footnote_1852" class="fnanchor">1852</a></p>

<p>The monkey-jack (H. <i>badhal</i>, B. <i>burhul</i>, <i>Artocarpus lacoocha</i>)
is another. The fruit may be of the size of a quince (var. apple).
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span>Its smell is not bad.<a name="FNanchor_1853" id="FNanchor_1853"></a><a href="#Footnote_1853" class="fnanchor">1853</a> Unripe it is a singularly tasteless and
empty<a name="FNanchor_1854" id="FNanchor_1854"></a><a href="#Footnote_1854" class="fnanchor">1854</a> thing; when ripe, it is not so bad. It ripens soft, can
be pulled to pieces and eaten anywhere, tastes very much like
a rotten quince, and has an excellent little austere flavour.</p>

<p>The lote-fruit (Sans. <i>ber</i>, <i>Zizyphus jujuba</i>) is another. Its
Persian name is understood to be <i>kanār</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1855" id="FNanchor_1855"></a><a href="#Footnote_1855" class="fnanchor">1855</a> It is of several kinds:
of one the fruit is larger than the plum (<i>ālūcha</i>)<a name="FNanchor_1856" id="FNanchor_1856"></a><a href="#Footnote_1856" class="fnanchor">1856</a>; another is
shaped like the Ḥusainī grape. Most of them are not very good;
we saw one in Bāndīr (Gūālīār) that was really good. The lote-tree
sheds its leaves under the Signs <i>S̤aur</i> and <i>Jauzā</i> (Bull and
Twins), burgeons under <i>Sarat̤ān</i> and <i>Asad</i> (Crab and Lion) which
are the true rainy-season,&mdash;then becoming fresh and green, and
it ripens its fruit under <i>Dalū</i> and <i>Ḥaut</i> (Bucket <i>i.e.</i> Aquarius, and
Fish).</p>

<p>The (Sans.) <i>karaūndā</i> (<i>Carissa carandas</i>, the corinda) is another.
It grows in bushes after the fashion of the (T.) <i>chīka</i> of our
country.<a name="FNanchor_1857" id="FNanchor_1857"></a><a href="#Footnote_1857" class="fnanchor">1857</a> but the <i>chīka</i> grows on mountains, the <i>karaūndā</i> on the<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;284b.</span>
plains. In flavour it is like the rhubarb itself,<a name="FNanchor_1858" id="FNanchor_1858"></a><a href="#Footnote_1858" class="fnanchor">1858</a> but is sweeter and
less juicy.</p>

<p>The (Sans.) <i>pānīyālā</i> (<i>Flacourtia cataphracta</i>)<a name="FNanchor_1859" id="FNanchor_1859"></a><a href="#Footnote_1859" class="fnanchor">1859</a> is another. It
is larger than the plum (<i>ālūcha</i>) and like the red-apple unripe.<a name="FNanchor_1860" id="FNanchor_1860"></a><a href="#Footnote_1860" class="fnanchor">1860</a>
It is a little austere and is good. The tree is taller than the
pomegranate’s; its leaf is like that of the almond-tree but
smaller.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span></p>
<p>The (H.) <i>gūlar</i> (<i>Ficus glomerata</i>, the clustered fig)<a name="FNanchor_1861" id="FNanchor_1861"></a><a href="#Footnote_1861" class="fnanchor">1861</a> is another.
The fruit grows out of the tree-trunk, resembles the fig (P. <i>anjīr</i>),
but is singularly tasteless.</p>

<p>The (Sans.) <i>āmlā</i> (<i>Phyllanthus emblica</i>, the myrobalan-tree) is
another. This also is a five-sided fruit.<a name="FNanchor_1862" id="FNanchor_1862"></a><a href="#Footnote_1862" class="fnanchor">1862</a> It looks like the unblown
cotton-pod. It is an astringent and ill-flavoured thing,
but confiture made of it is not bad. It is a wholesome fruit. Its
tree is of excellent form and has very minute leaves.</p>

<p>The (H.) <i>chirūnjī</i> (<i>Buchanania latifolia</i>)<a name="FNanchor_1863" id="FNanchor_1863"></a><a href="#Footnote_1863" class="fnanchor">1863</a> is another. This
tree had been understood to grow in the hills, but I knew later
about it, because there were three or four clumps of it in our
gardens. It is much like the <i>mahuwā</i>. Its kernel is not bad,
a thing between the walnut and the almond, not bad! rather
smaller than the pistachio and round; people put it in custards
(P. <i>pālūda</i>) and sweetmeats (Ar. <i>ḥalwa</i>).</p>

<p>The date-palm (P. <i>khurmā</i>, <i>Phœnix dactylifera</i>) is another.
This is not peculiar to Hindūstān, but is here described because
it is not in those countries (Tramontana). It grows in Lamghān
also.<a name="FNanchor_1864" id="FNanchor_1864"></a><a href="#Footnote_1864" class="fnanchor">1864</a> Its branches (<i>i.e.</i> leaves) grow from just one place at its
top; its leaves (<i>i.e.</i> leaflets) grow on both sides of the branches
(midribs) from neck (<i>būīn</i>) to tip; its trunk is rough and ill-coloured;
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;285.</span>its fruit is like a bunch of grapes, but much larger.
People say that the date-palm amongst vegetables resembles an
animal in two respects: one is that, as, if an animal’s head be
cut off, its life is taken, so it is with the date-palm, if its head is
cut off, it dries off; the other is that, as the offspring of animals
is not produced without the male, so too with the date-palm, it
gives no good fruit unless a branch of the male-tree be brought
into touch with the female-tree. The truth of this last matter
is not known (to me). The above-mentioned head of the date-palm
is called its cheese. The tree so grows that where its leaves
come out is cheese-white, the leaves becoming green as they
lengthen. This white part, the so-called cheese, is tolerable
eating, not bad, much like the walnut. People make a wound in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</a></span>the cheese, and into this wound insert a leaf(let), in such a way
that all liquid flowing from the wound runs down it.<a name="FNanchor_1865" id="FNanchor_1865"></a><a href="#Footnote_1865" class="fnanchor">1865</a> The tip
of the leaflet is set over the mouth of a pot suspended to the tree
in such a way that it collects whatever liquor is yielded by the
wound. This liquor is rather pleasant if drunk at once; if drunk
after two or three days, people say it is quite exhilarating
(<i>kaifīyat</i>). Once when I had gone to visit Bārī,<a name="FNanchor_1866" id="FNanchor_1866"></a><a href="#Footnote_1866" class="fnanchor">1866</a> and made an<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;285b.</span>
excursion to the villages on the bank of the Chaṃbal-river, we
met in with people collecting this date-liquor in the valley-bottom.
A good deal was drunk; no hilarity was felt; much must be
drunk, seemingly, to produce a little cheer.</p>

<p>The coco-nut palm (P. <i>nārgīl</i>, <i>Cocos nucifera</i>) is another. An
‘Arab gives it Arabic form<a name="FNanchor_1867" id="FNanchor_1867"></a><a href="#Footnote_1867" class="fnanchor">1867</a> and says <i>nārjīl</i>; Hindūstān people
say <i>nālīr</i>, seemingly by popular error.<a name="FNanchor_1868" id="FNanchor_1868"></a><a href="#Footnote_1868" class="fnanchor">1868</a> Its fruit is the Hindī-nut
from which black spoons (<i>qarā qāshūq</i>) are made and the
larger ones of which serve for guitar-bodies. The coco-palm has
general resemblance to the date-palm, but has more, and more
glistening leaves. Like the walnut, the coco-nut has a green
outer husk; but its husk is of fibre on fibre. All ropes for ships
and boats and also cord for sewing boat-seams are heard of as
made from these husks. The nut, when stripped of its husk, near
one end shews a triangle of hollows, two of which are solid, the
third a nothing (<i>būsh</i>), easily pierced. Before the kernel forms,
there is fluid inside; people pierce the soft hollow and drink
this; it tastes like date-palm cheese in solution, and is not bad.</p>

<p>The (Sans.) <i>tāṛ</i> (<i>Borassus flabelliformis</i>, the Palmyra-palm) is
another. Its branches (<i>i.e.</i> leaves) also are quite at its top. Just as<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;286.</span>
with the date-palm, people hang a pot on it, take its juice and
drink it. They call this liquor <i>tāṛī</i>;<a name="FNanchor_1869" id="FNanchor_1869"></a><a href="#Footnote_1869" class="fnanchor">1869</a> it is said to be more exhilarating
than date liquor. For about a yard along its branches
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</a></span>(<i>i.e.</i> leaf-stems)<a name="FNanchor_1870" id="FNanchor_1870"></a><a href="#Footnote_1870" class="fnanchor">1870</a> there are no leaves; above this, at the tip of
the branch (stem), 30 or 40 open out like the spread palm of the
hand, all from one place. These leaves approach a yard in length.
People often write Hindī characters on them after the fashion of
account rolls (<i>daftar yūsūnlūq</i>).</p>

<p>The orange (Ar. <i>nāranj</i>, <i>Citrus aurantium</i>) and orange-like
fruits are others of Hindūstān.<a name="FNanchor_1871" id="FNanchor_1871"></a><a href="#Footnote_1871" class="fnanchor">1871</a> Oranges grow well in the
Lamghānāt, Bajaur and Sawād. The Lamghānāt one is smallish,
has a navel,<a name="FNanchor_1872" id="FNanchor_1872"></a><a href="#Footnote_1872" class="fnanchor">1872</a> is very agreeable, fragile and juicy. It is not at all
like the orange of Khurāsān and those parts, being so fragile
that many spoil before reaching Kābul from the Lamghānāt
which may be 13-14 <i>yīghāch</i> (65-70 miles), while the Astarābād
orange, by reason of its thick skin and scant juice, carries with
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;286b.</span>less damage from there to Samarkand, some 270-280 <i>yīghāch</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1873" id="FNanchor_1873"></a><a href="#Footnote_1873" class="fnanchor">1873</a>
The Bajaur orange is about as large as a quince, very juicy and
more acid than other oranges. Khwāja Kalān once said to me,
“We counted the oranges gathered from a single tree of this sort
in Bajaur and it mounted up to 7,000.” It had been always in
my mind that the word <i>nāranj</i> was an Arabic form;<a name="FNanchor_1874" id="FNanchor_1874"></a><a href="#Footnote_1874" class="fnanchor">1874</a> it would
seem to be really so, since every-one in Bajaur and Sawād says
(P.) <i>nārang</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1875" id="FNanchor_1875"></a><a href="#Footnote_1875" class="fnanchor">1875</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</a></span></p>
<p>The lime (B. <i>līmū</i>, <i>C. acida</i>) is another. It is very plentiful,
about the size of a hen’s egg, and of the same shape. If a person
poisoned drink the water in which its fibres have been boiled,
danger is averted.<a name="FNanchor_1876" id="FNanchor_1876"></a><a href="#Footnote_1876" class="fnanchor">1876</a></p>

<p>The citron (P. <i>turunj</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1877" id="FNanchor_1877"></a><a href="#Footnote_1877" class="fnanchor">1877</a> <i>C. medica</i>) is another of the fruits
resembling the orange. Bajaurīs and Sawādīs call it <i>bālang</i> and
hence give the name <i>bālang-marabbā</i> to its marmalade (<i>marabbā</i>)
confiture. In Hindūstān people call the <i>turunj bajaurī</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1878" id="FNanchor_1878"></a><a href="#Footnote_1878" class="fnanchor">1878</a> There
are two kinds of <i>turunj</i>: one is sweet, flavourless and nauseating,
of no use for eating but with peel that may be good for marmalade;
it has the same sickening sweetness as the Lamghānāt
<i>turunj</i>; the other, that of Hindūstān and Bajaur, is acid, quite
deliciously acid, and makes excellent sherbet, well-flavoured, and
wholesome drinking. Its size may be that of the Khusrawī melon;
it has a thick skin, wrinkled and uneven, with one end thinner and
beaked. It is of a deeper yellow than the orange (<i>nāranj</i>). Its
tree has no trunk, is rather low, grows in bushes, and has a larger<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;287.</span>
leaf than the orange.</p>

<p>The <i>sangtāra</i><a name="FNanchor_1879" id="FNanchor_1879"></a><a href="#Footnote_1879" class="fnanchor">1879</a> is another fruit resembling the orange (<i>nāranj</i>).
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span>It is like the citron (<i>turunj</i>) in colour and form, but has both
ends of its skin level;<a name="FNanchor_1880" id="FNanchor_1880"></a><a href="#Footnote_1880" class="fnanchor">1880</a> also it is not rough and is somewhat the
smaller fruit. Its tree is large, as large as the apricot (<i>aūrūq</i>),
with a leaf like the orange’s. It is a deliciously acid fruit, making
a very pleasant and wholesome sherbet. Like the lime it is a
powerful stomachic, but not weakening like the orange (<i>nāranj</i>).</p>

<p>The large lime which they call (H.) <i>gal-gal</i><a name="FNanchor_1881" id="FNanchor_1881"></a><a href="#Footnote_1881" class="fnanchor">1881</a> in Hindūstān is
another fruit resembling the orange. It has the shape of a goose’s
egg, but unlike that egg, does not taper to the ends. Its skin is
smooth like the <i>sangtāra’s</i>; it is remarkably juicy.</p>

<p>The (H.) <i>jānbīrī</i> lime<a name="FNanchor_1882" id="FNanchor_1882"></a><a href="#Footnote_1882" class="fnanchor">1882</a> is another orange-like fruit. It is orange-shaped
and, though yellow, not orange-yellow. It smells like the
citron (<i>turunj</i>); it too is deliciously acid.</p>

<p>The (Sans.) <i>sadā-fal</i> (<i>phal</i>)<a name="FNanchor_1883" id="FNanchor_1883"></a><a href="#Footnote_1883" class="fnanchor">1883</a> is another orange-like fruit. This
is pear-shaped, colours like the quince, ripens sweet, but not to
the sickly-sweetness of the orange (<i>nāranj</i>).</p>

<p>The <i>amrd-fal</i> (sic. Ḥai. MS.&mdash;Sans. <i>amrit-phal</i>)<a name="FNanchor_1884" id="FNanchor_1884"></a><a href="#Footnote_1884" class="fnanchor">1884</a> is another
orange-like fruit.</p>

<p>The lemon (H. <i>karnā</i>, <i>C. limonum</i>) is another fruit resembling
the orange (<i>nāranj</i>); it may be as large as the <i>gal-gal</i> and is also
acid.</p>

<p>The (Sans.) <i>amal-bīd</i><a name="FNanchor_1885" id="FNanchor_1885"></a><a href="#Footnote_1885" class="fnanchor">1885</a> is another fruit resembling the orange.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></span>After three years (in Hindūstān), it was first seen to-day.<a name="FNanchor_1886" id="FNanchor_1886"></a><a href="#Footnote_1886" class="fnanchor">1886</a> They
say a needle melts away if put inside it,<a name="FNanchor_1887" id="FNanchor_1887"></a><a href="#Footnote_1887" class="fnanchor">1887</a> either from its acidity<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;287b.</span>
or some other property. It is as acid, perhaps, as the citron and
lemon (<i>turunj</i> and <i>līmū</i>).<a name="FNanchor_1888" id="FNanchor_1888"></a><a href="#Footnote_1888" class="fnanchor">1888</a></p>

<p class="indent">(<i>m. Vegetable products of Hindūstān:&mdash;Flowers.</i>)</p>

<p>In Hindūstān there is great variety of flowers. One is the (D.)
<i>jāsūn</i> (<i>Hibiscus rosa sinensis</i>), which some Hindūstānīs call
(Hindī) <i>gaẕhal</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1889" id="FNanchor_1889"></a><a href="#Footnote_1889" class="fnanchor">1889</a> *It is not a grass (<i>giyāh</i>); its tree (is in stems
like the bush of the red-rose; it) is rather taller than the bush
of the red-rose.<a name="FNanchor_1890" id="FNanchor_1890"></a><a href="#Footnote_1890" class="fnanchor">1890</a>* The flower of the <i>jāsūn</i> is fuller in colour than
that of the pomegranate, and may be of the size of the red-rose,
but, the red-rose, when its bud has grown, opens simply, whereas,
when the <i>jāsūn</i>-bud opens, a stem on which other petals grow,
is seen like a heart amongst its expanded petals. Though the
two are parts of the one flower, yet the outcome of the lengthening
and thinning of that stem-like heart of the first-opened petals
gives the semblance of two flowers.<a name="FNanchor_1891" id="FNanchor_1891"></a><a href="#Footnote_1891" class="fnanchor">1891</a> It is not a common matter.
The beautifully coloured flowers look very well on the tree, but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</a></span>they do not last long; they fade in just one day. The <i>jāsūn</i>
blossoms very well through the four months of the rains; it seems
indeed to flower all through the year; with this profusion, however,
it gives no perfume.</p>

<p>The (H.) <i>kanīr</i> (<i>Nerium odorum</i>, the oleander)<a name="FNanchor_1892" id="FNanchor_1892"></a><a href="#Footnote_1892" class="fnanchor">1892</a> is another. It
grows both red and white. Like the peach-flower, it is five
petalled. It is like the peach-bloom (in colour?), but opens 14
or 15 flowers from one place, so that seen from a distance, they
look like one great flower. The oleander-bush is taller than the
rose-bush. The red oleander has a sort of scent, faint and agreeable.
(Like the <i>jāsūn</i>,) it also blooms well and profusely in the
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;288.</span>rains, and it also is had through most of the year.</p>

<p>The (H.) (<i>kīūrā</i>) (<i>Pandanus odoratissimus</i>, the screw-pine) is
another.<a name="FNanchor_1893" id="FNanchor_1893"></a><a href="#Footnote_1893" class="fnanchor">1893</a> It has a very agreeable perfume.<a name="FNanchor_1894" id="FNanchor_1894"></a><a href="#Footnote_1894" class="fnanchor">1894</a> Musk has the defect
of being dry; this may be called moist musk&mdash;a very agreeable
perfume. The tree’s singular appearance notwithstanding, it has
flowers perhaps 1-1/2 to 2 <i>qārīsh</i> (13-1/2 to 18 inches) long. It has
long leaves having the character of the reed (P.) <i>gharau</i><a name="FNanchor_1895" id="FNanchor_1895"></a><a href="#Footnote_1895" class="fnanchor">1895</a> and
having spines. Of these leaves, while pressed together bud-like,
the outer ones are the greener and more spiny; the inner ones
are soft and white. In amongst these inner leaves grow things
like what belongs to the middle of a flower, and from these
things comes the excellent perfume. When the tree first comes
up not yet shewing any trunk, it is like the bush (<i>būta</i>) of the
male-reed,<a name="FNanchor_1896" id="FNanchor_1896"></a><a href="#Footnote_1896" class="fnanchor">1896</a> but with wider and more spiny leaves. What serves
it for a trunk is very shapeless, its roots remaining shewn.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</a></span></p>
<p>The (P.) <i>yāsman</i> (jasmine) is another; the white they call (B.)
<i>champa</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1897" id="FNanchor_1897"></a><a href="#Footnote_1897" class="fnanchor">1897</a> It is larger and more strongly scented than our
<i>yāsman</i>-flower.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>n. Seasons of the year.</i>)</p>

<p>Again:&mdash;whereas there are four seasons in those countries,<a name="FNanchor_1898" id="FNanchor_1898"></a><a href="#Footnote_1898" class="fnanchor">1898</a>
there are three in Hindūstān, namely, four months are summer;
four are the rains; four are winter. The beginning of their
months is from the welcome of the crescent-moons.<a name="FNanchor_1899" id="FNanchor_1899"></a><a href="#Footnote_1899" class="fnanchor">1899</a> Every
three years they add a month to the year; if one had been added
to the rainy season, the next is added, three years later, to the
winter months, the next, in the same way, to the hot months.
This is their mode of intercalation.<a name="FNanchor_1900" id="FNanchor_1900"></a><a href="#Footnote_1900" class="fnanchor">1900</a> (<i>Chait</i>, <i>Baisākh</i>, <i>Jeṭh</i> and<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;288b.</span>

Bull and Twins; <i>Sāwan</i>, <i>Bhādoṅ</i>, <i>Kū,ār</i> and <i>Kātik</i>) are the
rainy months, corresponding with the Crab, (Lion, Virgin and
Balance; <i>Aghan</i>, <i>Pūs</i>, <i>Māgh</i> and <i>Phālgun</i>) are the cold months,
corresponding with the Scorpion, (Archer, Capricorn, and Bucket
or Aquarius).</p>

<p>The people of Hind, having thus divided the year into three
seasons of four months each, divide each of those seasons by
taking from each, the two months of the force of the heat, rain,<a name="FNanchor_1901" id="FNanchor_1901"></a><a href="#Footnote_1901" class="fnanchor">1901</a>
and cold. Of the hot months the last two, <i>i.e. Jeṭh</i> and <i>Asāṛh</i>
are the force of the heat; of the rainy months, the first two, <i>i.e.
Sāwan</i> and <i>Bhādoṅ</i> are the force of the rains; of the cold season,
the middle two, <i>i.e. Pūs</i> and <i>Māgh</i> are the force of the cold. By
this classification there are six seasons in Hindūstān.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">(<i>o. Days of the week.</i>)</p>

<p>To the days also they have given names:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_1902" id="FNanchor_1902"></a><a href="#Footnote_1902" class="fnanchor">1902</a> (<i>Sanīchar</i> is
Saturday; <i>Rabī-bār</i> is Sunday; <i>Som-wār</i> is Monday; <i>Mangal-wār</i>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;289.</span>(<i>Author’s note on the daqīqa.</i>) The <i>daqīqa</i> is about as long as six repetitions

repetitions of the <i>Fātiḥa</i> with the <i>Bismillāh.</i></p></div>

<p>As in our countries what is known by the (Turkī) term <i>kīcha-gūndūz</i>
(a day-and-night, nycthemeron) is divided into 24 parts,
each called an hour (Ar. <i>sā‘at</i>), and the hour is divided into 60
parts, each called a minute (Ar. <i>daqīqa</i>), so that a day-and-night
consists of 1440 minutes,&mdash;so the people of Hind divide the night-and-day
into 60 parts, each called a (S.) <i>g’harī</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1903" id="FNanchor_1903"></a><a href="#Footnote_1903" class="fnanchor">1903</a> They also
divide the night into four and the day into four, calling each part
a (S.) <i>pahr</i> (watch) which in Persian is a <i>pās</i>. A watch and
watchman (<i>pās u pāsbān</i>) had been heard about (by us) in those
countries (Transoxania), but without these particulars. Agreeing
with the division into watches, a body of <i>g’harīālīs</i><a name="FNanchor_1904" id="FNanchor_1904"></a><a href="#Footnote_1904" class="fnanchor">1904</a> is chosen
and appointed in all considerable towns of Hindūstān. They
cast a broad brass (plate-) thing,<a name="FNanchor_1905" id="FNanchor_1905"></a><a href="#Footnote_1905" class="fnanchor">1905</a> perhaps as large as a tray
(<i>t̤abaq</i>) and about two hands'-thickness; this they call a <i>g’harīāl</i>
and hang up in a high place (<i>bīr buland yīr-dā</i>). Also they have
a vessel perforated at the bottom like an hour-cup<a name="FNanchor_1906" id="FNanchor_1906"></a><a href="#Footnote_1906" class="fnanchor">1906</a> and filling

the gong once with their mallets; when a second time, twice, and
so on till the end of the watch. They announce the end of a
watch by several rapid blows of their mallets. After these they
pause; then strike once more, if the first day-watch has ended,
twice if the second, three times if the third, and four times if the
fourth. After the fourth day-watch, when the night-watches
begin, these are gone through in the same way. It used to be
the rule to beat the sign of a watch only when the watch ended;
so that sleepers chancing to wake in the night and hear the sound
of a third or fourth <i>g’harī</i>, would not know whether it was of the
second or third night-watch. I therefore ordered that at night
or on a cloudy day the sign of the watch should be struck after
that of the <i>g’harī</i>, for example, that after striking the third <i>g’harī</i>
of the first night-watch, the <i>g’harīālīs</i> were to pause and then
strike the sign of the watch, in order to make it known that this
third <i>g’harī</i> was of the first night-watch,&mdash;and that after striking
four <i>g’harīs</i> of the third night-watch, they should pause and then
strike the sign of the third watch, in order to make it known that
this fourth <i>g’harī</i> was of the third night-watch. It did very well;
anyone happening to wake in the night and hear the gong, would
know what <i>g’harī</i> of what watch of night it was.</p>

<p>Again, they divide the <i>g’harī</i> into 60 parts, each part being
called a <i>pal</i>;<a name="FNanchor_1907" id="FNanchor_1907"></a><a href="#Footnote_1907" class="fnanchor">1907</a> by this each night-and-day will consist of 3,500 <i>pals</i>.<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;290.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(<i>Author’s note on the pal.</i>) They say the length of a <i>pal</i> is the shutting and
opening of the eyelids 60 times, which in a night-and-day would be 216,000
shuttings and openings of the eyes. Experiment shews that a <i>pal</i> is about
equal to 8 repetitions of the <i>Qul-huwa-allāh</i><a name="FNanchor_1908" id="FNanchor_1908"></a><a href="#Footnote_1908" class="fnanchor">1908</a> and <i>Bismillāh</i>; this would be
28,000 repetitions in a night-and-day.</p></div>

<p class="indent">(<i>q. Measures.</i>)</p>

<p>The people of Hind have also well-arranged measures:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_1909" id="FNanchor_1909"></a><a href="#Footnote_1909" class="fnanchor">1909</a>
8 <i>ratīs</i> = 1 <i>māsha</i>; 4 <i>māsha</i> = 1 <i>tānk</i> = 32 <i>ratīs</i>; 5 <i>māsha</i> =
1 <i>miṣqāl</i> = 40 <i>ratīs</i>; 12 <i>māsha</i> = 1 <i>tūla</i> = 96 <i>ratīs</i>; 14 <i>tūla</i> = 1 <i>ser</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</a></span></p>

<p>This is everywhere fixed:&mdash;40 <i>ser</i> = 1 <i>mānbān</i>; 12 <i>mānbān</i> =
1 <i>mānī</i>; 100 <i>mānī</i> they call a <i>mīnāsa</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1910" id="FNanchor_1910"></a><a href="#Footnote_1910" class="fnanchor">1910</a></p>

<p class="indent">Pearls and jewels they weigh by the <i>tānk</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>r. Modes of reckoning.</i>)</p>

<p>The people of Hind have also an excellent mode of reckoning:
100,000 they call a <i>lak</i>; 100 <i>laks</i>, a <i>krūr</i>; 100 <i>krūrs</i>, an <i>arb</i>;
100 <i>arbs</i>, 1 <i>karb</i>; 100 <i>karb’s</i>, 1 <i>nīl</i>; 100 <i>nīls</i>, 1 <i>padam</i>; 100 <i>padams</i>,
1 <i>sāng</i>. The fixing of such high reckonings as these is proof of
the great amount of wealth in Hindūstān.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>s. Hindū inhabitants of Hindūstān.</i>)</p>

<p>Most of the inhabitants of Hindūstān are pagans; they call
a pagan a Hindū. Most Hindūs believe in the transmigration
of souls. All artisans, wage-earners, and officials are Hindūs. In
our countries dwellers in the wilds (<i>i.e.</i> nomads) get tribal names;
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;290b.</span>here the settled people of the cultivated lands and villages get
tribal names.<a name="FNanchor_1911" id="FNanchor_1911"></a><a href="#Footnote_1911" class="fnanchor">1911</a> Again:&mdash;every artisan there is follows the trade
that has come down to him from forefather to forefather.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>t. Defects of Hindūstān.</i>)</p>

<p>Hindūstān is a country of few charms. Its people have no
good looks; of social intercourse, paying and receiving visits there
is none; of genius and capacity none; of manners none; in
handicraft and work there is no form or symmetry, method or
quality; there are no good horses, no good dogs, no grapes, musk-melons
or first-rate fruits, no ice or cold water, no good bread or
cooked food in the <i>bāzārs</i>, no Hot-baths, no Colleges, no candles,
torches or candlesticks.</p>

<p>In place of candle and torch they have a great dirty gang they
call lamp-men (<i>diwatī</i>), who in the left hand hold a smallish
wooden tripod to one corner of which a thing like the top of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</a></span>a candlestick is fixed, having a wick in it about as thick as the
thumb. In the right hand they hold a gourd, through a narrow
slit made in which, oil is let trickle in a thin thread when the
wick needs it. Great people keep a hundred or two of these
lamp-men. This is the Hindūstān substitute for lamps and
candlesticks! If their rulers and begs have work at night needing
candles, these dirty lamp-men bring these lamps, go close up and<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;291.</span>
there stand.</p>

<p>Except their large rivers and their standing-waters which flow
in ravines or hollows (there are no waters). There are no
running-waters in their gardens or residences (<i>‘imāratlār</i>).<a name="FNanchor_1912" id="FNanchor_1912"></a><a href="#Footnote_1912" class="fnanchor">1912</a>
These residences have no charm, air (<i>hawā</i>), regularity or
symmetry.</p>

<p>Peasants and people of low standing go about naked. They
tie on a thing called <i>lungūtā</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1913" id="FNanchor_1913"></a><a href="#Footnote_1913" class="fnanchor">1913</a> a decency-clout which hangs two
spans below the navel. From the tie of this pendant decency-clout,
another clout is passed between the thighs and made fast
behind. Women also tie on a cloth (<i>lung</i>), one-half of which goes
round the waist, the other is thrown over the head.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>u. Advantages of Hindūstān.</i>)</p>

<p>Pleasant things of Hindūstān are that it is a large country and
has masses of gold and silver. Its air in the Rains is very fine.
Sometimes it rains 10, 15 or 20 times a day; torrents pour down
all at once and rivers flow where no water had been. While it
rains and through the Rains, the air is remarkably fine, not to be
surpassed for healthiness and charm. The fault is that the air
becomes very soft and damp. A bow of those (Transoxanian)
countries after going through the Rains in Hindūstān, may not
be drawn even; it is ruined; not only the bow, everything is<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;291b.</span>
affected, armour, book, cloth, and utensils all; a house even does
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</a></span>not last long. Not only in the Rains but also in the cold and
the hot seasons, the airs are excellent; at these times, however,
the north-west wind constantly gets up laden with dust and earth.
It gets up in great strength every year in the heats, under the
Bull and Twins when the Rains are near; so strong and carrying
so much dust and earth that there is no seeing one another.
People call this wind Darkener of the Sky (H. <i>āndhī</i>). The
weather is hot under the Bull and Twins, but not intolerably
so, not so hot as in Balkh and Qandahār and not for half
so long.</p>

<p>Another good thing in Hindūstān is that it has unnumbered
and endless workmen of every kind. There is a fixed caste (<i>jam‘ī</i>)
for every sort of work and for every thing, which has done that
work or that thing from father to son till now. Mullā Sharaf,
writing in the <i>Z̤afar-nāma</i> about the building of Tīmūr Beg’s
Stone Mosque, lays stress on the fact that on it 200 stone-cutters
worked, from Āẕarbāījān, Fars, Hindūstān and other countries.
But 680 men worked daily on my buildings in Āgra and of Āgra
stone-cutters only; while 1491 stone-cutters worked daily on my
buildings in Āgra, Sīkrī, Bīāna, Dūlpūr, Gūālīār and Kūīl. In
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;292.</span>the same way there are numberless artisans and workmen of
every sort in Hindūstān.</p>

<p>The revenue of the countries now held by me (935 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1528

and distribution of the treasure were begun. To Humāyūn
were given 70 laks from the Treasury, and, over and above this,
a treasure house was bestowed on him just as it was, without
ascertaining and writing down its contents. To some begs
10 laks were given, 8, 7, or 6 to others.<a name="FNanchor_1919" id="FNanchor_1919"></a><a href="#Footnote_1919" class="fnanchor">1919</a> Suitable money-gifts

<p class="indent">(<i>b. Disaffection to Bābur.</i>)</p>

<p>On our first coming to Āgra, there was remarkable dislike and
hostility between its people and mine, the peasantry and soldiers
running away in fear of our men. Dilhī and Āgra excepted,
not a fortified town but strengthened its defences and neither
was in obedience nor submitted. Qāsim Saṃbhalī was in
Saṃbhal; Niz̤ām Khān was in Bīāna; in Mīwāt was Ḥasan
Khān Mīwātī himself, impious mannikin! who was the sole
leader of the trouble and mischief.<a name="FNanchor_1924" id="FNanchor_1924"></a><a href="#Footnote_1924" class="fnanchor">1924</a> Muḥammad <i>Zaitun</i> was in
Dūlpūr; Tātār Khān <i>Sārang-khānī</i><a name="FNanchor_1925" id="FNanchor_1925"></a><a href="#Footnote_1925" class="fnanchor">1925</a> was in Gūālīār; Ḥusain
Khān <i>Nuḥānī</i> was in Rāprī; Qut̤b Khān was in Itāwa (Etāwa);
‘Ālam Khān (<i>Kālpī</i>) was in Kālpī. Qanauj and the other side
of Gang (Ganges) was all held by Afghāns in independent
hostility,<a name="FNanchor_1926" id="FNanchor_1926"></a><a href="#Footnote_1926" class="fnanchor">1926</a> such as Naṣīr Khān <i>Nuḥānī</i>, Ma‘rūf <i>Farmūlī</i> and a
crowd of other amīrs. These had been in rebellion for three or
four years before Ibrāhīm’s death and when I defeated him,
were holding Qanauj and the whole country beyond it. At
the present time they were lying two or three marches on our
side of Qanauj and had made Bihār Khān the son of Daryā Khān
<i>Nuḥānī</i> their <i>pādshāh</i>, under the style Sult̤ān Muḥammad.<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;294b.</span>
Marghūb the slave was in Mahāwīn (<i>Muttra</i>?); he remained there,
thus close, for some time but came no nearer.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">(<i>c. Discontent in Bābur’s army.</i>)</p>

<p>It was the hot-season when we came to Āgra. All the
inhabitants (<i>khalāīq</i>) had run away in terror. Neither grain for
ourselves nor corn for our horses was to be had. The villages,
out of hostility and hatred to us had taken to thieving and
highway-robbery; there was no moving on the roads. There
had been no chance since the treasure was distributed to send
men in strength into the parganas and elsewhere. Moreover
the year was a very hot one; violent pestilential winds struck
people down in heaps together; masses began to die off.</p>

<p>On these accounts the greater part of the begs and best braves
became unwilling to stay in Hindūstān, indeed set their faces for
leaving it. It is no reproach to old and experienced begs if they
speak of such matters; even if they do so, this man (Bābur) has
enough sense and reason to get at what is honest or what is
mutinous in their representations, to distinguish between loss
and gain. But as this man had seen his task whole, for himself,
when he resolved on it, what taste was there in their reiterating
that things should be done differently? What recommends
the expression of distasteful opinions by men of little standing
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;295.</span>(<i>kīchīk karīm</i>)? Here is a curious thing:&mdash;This last time of
our riding out from Kābul, a few men of little standing had just
been made begs; what I looked for from them was that if I
went through fire and water and came out again, they would
have gone in with me unhesitatingly, and with me have come
out, that wherever I went, there at my side would they be,&mdash;not
that they would speak against my fixed purpose, not that they
would turn back from any task or great affair on which, all
counselling, all consenting, we had resolved, so long as that
counsel was not abandoned. Badly as these new begs behaved,
Secretary Aḥmadī and Treasurer Walī behaved still worse.
Khwāja Kalān had done well in the march out from Kābul, in
Ibrāhīm’s defeat and until Āgra was occupied; he had spoken
bold words and shewn ambitious views. But a few days after
the capture of Āgra, all his views changed,&mdash;the one zealous for
departure at any price was Khwāja Kalān.<a name="FNanchor_1927" id="FNanchor_1927"></a><a href="#Footnote_1927" class="fnanchor">1927</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">(<i>d. Bābur calls a council.</i>)</p>

<p>When I knew of this unsteadiness amongst (my) people, I
summoned all the begs and took counsel. Said I, “There is no
supremacy and grip on the world without means and resources;
without lands and retainers sovereignty and command (<i>pādshāhlīq
u amīrlīq</i>) are impossible. By the labours of several years, by
encountering hardship, by long travel, by flinging myself and
the army into battle, and by deadly slaughter, we, through God’s<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;295b.</span>
grace, beat these masses of enemies in order that we might take
their broad lands. And now what force compels us, what
necessity has arisen that we should, without cause, abandon
countries taken at such risk of life? Was it for us to remain in
Kābul, the sport of harsh poverty? Henceforth, let no well-wisher
of mine speak of such things! But let not those turn
back from going who, weak in strong persistence, have set their
faces to depart!” By these words, which recalled just and

Saṃbal (Saṃbhal), but Saṃbal was now bestowed on Humāyūn,
in addition to his guerdon of Ḥiṣār-fīrūza, and in his service
was Hindū Beg. To suit this, therefore, Hindū Beg was sent
to make the incursion in Muḥammadī’s place, and with him
Kitta Beg, Bābā <i>Qashqa’s</i> (brother) Malik Qāsim and his elder
and younger brethren, Mullā Apāq and Shaikh Gūran (G’hūran)

<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;297b.</span>Three or four times a person had come from Qāsim

us,<a name="FNanchor_1941" id="FNanchor_1941"></a><a href="#Footnote_1941" class="fnanchor">1941</a> had gone skirting the hills and gathering up Afghān and

he laid siege to it. Hindū Beg and Kitta Beg and

Qāsim with his elder and younger brethren, while they themselves
were getting over the water. Malik Qāsim crossed,
advanced swiftly with from 100 to 150 men&mdash;his own and his
brethren’s&mdash;and reached Saṃbal by the Mid-day Prayer. Bīban
for his part came out of his camp in array. Malik Qāsim and
his troop moved rapidly forward, got the fort in their rear, and
came to grips. Bīban could make no stand; he fled. Malik
Qāsim cut off the heads of part of his force, took many horses,

a few elephants and a mass of booty. Next day when the
other begs arrived, Qāsim <i>Saṃbalī</i> came out and saw them, but
not liking to surrender the fort, made them false pretences.
One day Shaikh Gūran (G’hūran) and Hindū Beg having talked

<p>While we were still in Kābul, Rānā Sangā had sent an envoy
to testify to his good wishes and to propose this plan: “If the

I from this will move on Āgra.” But I beat Ibrāhīm, I took
Dihlī and Āgra, and up to now that Pagan has given no sign
soever of moving. After a while he went and laid siege to

This Ḥasan-of-Makan had sent a person to me several times,
but had not shewn himself. We had not been able to detach<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;298b.</span>
reinforcement for him because, as the forts round-about&mdash;Atāwa
(Etāwa), Dūlpūr, and Bīāna&mdash;had not yet surrendered, and
the Eastern Afghāns were seated with their army in obstinate
rebellion two or three marches on the Āgra side of Qanūj, my
mind was not quite free from the whirl and strain of things

had been sent several times, but as he neither came and saw me,
nor abandoned Etāwa and got away, it was given to Mahdī

the Hindūstān amīrs, and tossed the following matters in
amongst them:&mdash;The various rebel amīrs of the East, that is to
say, those under Nāṣir Khān <i>Nuḥānī</i> and Ma‘rūf <i>Farmūlī</i>, have
crossed Gang (Ganges) with 40 to 50,000 men, taken Qanūj,
and now lie some three miles on our side of the river. The
Pagan Rānā Sangā has captured Kandār and is in a hostile and
mischievous attitude. The end of the Rains is near. It seems
expedient to move either against the rebels or the Pagan, since
the task of the forts near-by is easy; when the great foes are
got rid of, what road will remain open for the rest? Rānā
Sangā is thought not to be the equal of the rebels.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[Pg 531]</a></span></p>
<p>To this all replied unanimously, “Rānā Sangā is the most
distant, and it is not known that he will come nearer; the
enemy who is closest at hand must first be got rid of. We are
for riding against the rebels.” Humāyūn then represented,<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;299b.</span>
“What need is there for the Pādshāh to ride out? This service
I will do.” This came as a pleasure to every-one; the Turk and
Hind amīrs gladly accepted his views; he was appointed for the
East. A Kābulī of Aḥmad-i-qāsim’s was sent galloping off to
tell the armies that had been despatched against Dūlpūr to join
Humāyūn at Chandwār;<a name="FNanchor_1947" id="FNanchor_1947"></a><a href="#Footnote_1947" class="fnanchor">1947</a> also those sent against Etāwa under

<p>One of the great defects of Hindūstān being its lack of
running-waters,<a name="FNanchor_1948" id="FNanchor_1948"></a><a href="#Footnote_1948" class="fnanchor">1948</a> it kept coming to my mind that waters should
be made to flow by means of wheels erected wherever I might
settle down, also that grounds should be laid out in an orderly
and symmetrical way. With this object in view, we crossed the
Jūn-water to look at garden-grounds a few days after entering
Āgra. Those grounds were so bad and unattractive that we
traversed them with a hundred disgusts and repulsions. So
ugly and displeasing were they, that the idea of making a<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;300.</span>
Chār-bāgh in them passed from my mind, but needs must! as
there was no other land near Āgra, that same ground was taken
in hand a few days later.</p>

<p>The beginning was made with the large well from which water
comes for the Hot-bath, and also with the piece of ground where
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[Pg 532]</a></span>the tamarind-trees and the octagonal tank now are. After that
came the large tank with its enclosure; after that the tank and

symmetry, with suitable borders and parterres in every corner,
and in every border rose and narcissus in perfect arrangement.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>m. Construction of a chambered-well.</i>)</p>

<p>Three things oppressed us in Hindūstān, its heat, its violent
winds, its dust. Against all three the Bath is a protection, for
in it, what is known of dust and wind? and in the heats it is so
chilly that one is almost cold. The bath-room in which the
heated tank is, is altogether of stone, the whole, except for the
<i>īzāra</i> (dado?) of white stone, being, pavement and roofing, of
red Bīāna stone.</p>

wheels like those in Dīpālpūr and Lāhor. The people of Hind
who had never seen grounds planned so symmetrically and thus
laid out, called the side of the Jūn where (our) residences were,
Kābul.</p>

<p>In an empty space inside the fort, which was between
Ibrāhīm’s residence and the ramparts, I ordered a large
chambered-well (<i>wāīn</i>) to be made, measuring 10 by 10,<a name="FNanchor_1952" id="FNanchor_1952"></a><a href="#Footnote_1952" class="fnanchor">1952</a> a large

This well was begun before the Chār-bāgh<a name="FNanchor_1954" id="FNanchor_1954"></a><a href="#Footnote_1954" class="fnanchor">1954</a>; they were busy
digging it in the true Rains (<i>‘aīn bīshkāl</i>, Sāwan and Bhadon);
it fell in several times and buried the hired workmen; it was
finished after the Holy Battle with Rānā Sangā, as is stated in
the inscription on the stone that bears the chronogram of its
completion. It is a complete <i>wāīn</i>, having a three-storeyed
house in it. The lowest storey consists of three rooms, each of
which opens on the descending steps, at intervals of three steps
from one another. When the water is at its lowest, it is one
step below the bottom chamber; when it rises in the Rains, it
sometimes goes into the top storey. In the middle storey an
inner chamber has been excavated which connects with the
domed building in which the bullock turns the well-wheel. The<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;301.</span>
top storey is a single room, reached from two sides by 5 or 6
steps which lead down to it from the enclosure overlooked from
the well-head. Facing the right-hand way down, is the stone
inscribed with the date of completion. At the side of this well
is another the bottom of which may be at half the depth of the
first, and into which water comes from that first one when the
bullock turns the wheel in the domed building afore-mentioned.
This second well also is fitted with a wheel, by means of which
water is carried along the ramparts to the high-garden. A stone
building (<i>tāshdīn ‘imārat</i>) stands at the mouth of the well and
there is an outer(?) mosque<a name="FNanchor_1955" id="FNanchor_1955"></a><a href="#Footnote_1955" class="fnanchor">1955</a> outside (<i>tāshqārī</i>) the enclosure in

10 to 15 peasants whom he overcame and killed; then having
taken the revenues of Marv in 40 or 50 days,<a name="FNanchor_1959" id="FNanchor_1959"></a><a href="#Footnote_1959" class="fnanchor">1959</a> he went on to
Sarakhs. In Sarakhs were some 30 to 40 Red-heads (<i>Qīzīl-bāsh</i>)
who did not surrender, but shut the Gate; the peasantry however
scattered them and opened the Gate to the Aūzbeg who entering,
killed the Red-heads. Sarakhs taken, he went against T̤ūs and
Mashhad. The inhabitants of Mashhad being helpless, let him
in. T̤ūs he besieged for 8 months, took possession of on terms,
did not keep those terms, but killed every man of name and
made their women captive.</p>

Sl. Ibrāhīm after quarrel with his father, had been received
without honour. He had sent dutiful letters to me while I was
near Pānī-pat; I had replied by royal letters of favour and
kindness summoning him to me. He had thought of coming,
but changing his mind, drew off from Ibrāhīm’s army towards
Gujrāt. Meantime his father Sl. Muz̤affar had died (Friday
Jumāda II. 2nd <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-March 16th 1526 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>); his elder brother

<p>(<i>October 22nd-Muḥarram 15th</i>) Ustād ‘Alī-qulī had been
ordered to cast a large mortar for use against Bīāna and other
forts which had not yet submitted. When all the furnaces and
materials were ready, he sent a person to me and, on Monday
the 15th of the month, we went to see the mortar cast. Round
the mortar-mould he had had eight furnaces made in which
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;302b.</span>were the molten materials. From below each furnace a channel
went direct to the mould. When he opened the furnace-holes
on our arrival, the molten metal poured like water through all
these channels into the mould. After awhile and before the
mould was full, the flow stopped from one furnace after another.
Ustād ‘Alī-qulī must have made some miscalculation either as
to the furnaces or the materials. In his great distress, he was
for throwing himself into the mould of molten metal, but we
comforted him, put a robe of honour on him, and so brought
him out of his shame. The mould was left a day or two to
cool; when it was opened, Ustād ‘Alī-qulī with great delight
sent to say, “The stone-chamber (<i>tāsh-awī</i>) is without defect;
to cast the powder-compartment (<i>dārū-khāna</i>) is easy.” He got

<p>After (Humāyūn’s) army had gone to the East, we appointed,
to make a plundering excursion into the Bīāna neighbourhood,
Tardī Beg (brother) of Qūj Beg with his elder brother Sher-afgan,
Muḥammad Khalīl the master-gelder (<i>akhta-begī</i>) with his

<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;303b.</span>If they, by promise and persuasion, could make the Bīāna
garrison look towards us, they were to do so; if not, they were
to weaken the enemy by raid and plunder.</p>

<p>In the fort of Tahangar<a name="FNanchor_1969" id="FNanchor_1969"></a><a href="#Footnote_1969" class="fnanchor">1969</a> was ‘Ālam Khān the elder brother
of that same Niz̤ām Khān of Bīāna. People of his had come
again and again to set forth his obedience and well-wishing; he
now took it on himself to say, “If the Pādshāh appoint an army,
it will be my part by promise and persuasion to bring in the
quiver-weavers of Bīāna and to effect the capture of that fort.”
This being so, the following orders were given to the braves of
Tardī Beg’s expedition, “As ‘Ālam Khān, a local man, has taken
it on himself to serve and submit in this manner, act you with
him and in the way he approves in this matter of Bīāna.”
Swordsmen though some Hindūstānīs may be, most of them are
ignorant and unskilled in military move and stand (<i>yūrūsh u
tūrūsh</i>), in soldierly counsel and procedure. When our expedition
joined ‘Ālam Khān, he paid no attention to what any-one else
said, did not consider whether his action was good or bad, but
went close up to Bīāna, taking our men with him. Our expedition
numbered from 250 to 300 Turks with somewhat over 2000
Hindūstānīs and local people, while Niz̤ām Khān of Bīāna’s
Afghāns and <i>sipāhīs</i><a name="FNanchor_1970" id="FNanchor_1970"></a><a href="#Footnote_1970" class="fnanchor">1970</a> were an army of over 4000 horse and of
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;304.</span>foot-men themselves again, more than 10,000. Niz̤ām Khān
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[Pg 539]</a></span>
looked his opponents over, sallied suddenly out and, his massed
horse charging down, put our expeditionary force to flight. His
men unhorsed his elder brother ‘Ālam Khān, took 5 or 6 others
prisoner and contrived to capture part of the baggage. As we
had already made encouraging promises to Niz̤ām Khān, we now,
spite of this last impropriety, pardoned all earlier and this later
fault, and sent him royal letters. As he heard of Rānā Sangā’s
rapid advance, he had no resource but to call on Sayyid Rafī‘<a name="FNanchor_1971" id="FNanchor_1971"></a><a href="#Footnote_1971" class="fnanchor">1971</a>
for mediation, surrender the fort to our men, and come in with

Dost, Lord-of-the-gate was sent for a time to Bīāna, but a few
days later it was bestowed on Madhī Khwāja with a fixed
allowance of 70 <i>laks</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1974" id="FNanchor_1974"></a><a href="#Footnote_1974" class="fnanchor">1974</a> and he was given leave to go there.</p>

<p>Tātār Khān <i>Sārang-khānī</i>, who was in Gūālīār, had been
sending constantly to assure us of his obedience and good-wishes.
After the pagan took Kandār and was close to Bīāna,
Dharmankat, one of the Gūālīār rājas, and another pagan styled
Khān-i-jahān, went into the Gūālīār neighbourhood and, coveting
the fort, began to stir trouble and tumult. Tātār Khān, thus
placed in difficulty, was for surrendering Gūālīār (to us). Most
of our begs, household and best braves being away with
(Humāyūn’s) army or on various raids, we joined to Raḥīm-dād<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;304b.</span>
a few Bhīra men and Lāhorīs with Hastachī<a name="FNanchor_1975" id="FNanchor_1975"></a><a href="#Footnote_1975" class="fnanchor">1975</a> <i>tūnqit̤ār</i> and his
brethren. We assigned <i>parganas</i> in Gūālīār itself to all those
mentioned above. Mullā Apāq and Shaikh Gurān (G’hurān)
went also with them, they to return after Raḥīm-dād was established
in Gūālīār. By the time they were near Gūālīār however,
Tātār Khān’s views had changed, and he did not invite them
into the fort. Meantime Shaikh Muḥammad <i>Ghaus̤</i> (Helper),
a darwīsh-like man, not only very learned but with a large
following of students and disciples, sent from inside the fort to
say to Raḥīm-dād, “Get yourselves into the fort somehow, for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[Pg 540]</a></span>the views of this person (Tātār Khān) have changed, and he
has evil in his mind.” Hearing this, Raḥīm-dād sent to say to
Tātār Khān, “There is danger from the Pagan to those outside;
let me bring a few men into the fort and let the rest stay
outside.” Under insistence, Tātār Khān agreed to this, and
Raḥīm-dād went in with rather few men. Said he, “Let our
people stay near this Gate,” posted them near the Hātī-pul
(Elephant-gate) and through that Gate during that same night
brought in the whole of his troop. Next day, Tātār Khān,
reduced to helplessness, willy-nilly, made over the fort, and set
out to come and wait on me in Āgra. A subsistence allowance
of 20 <i>laks</i> was assigned to him on Bīānwān <i>pargana</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1976" id="FNanchor_1976"></a><a href="#Footnote_1976" class="fnanchor">1976</a></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;305.</span>Muḥammad <i>Zaitūn</i> also took the only course open to him by
surrendering Dūlpūr and coming to wait on me. A <i>pargana</i>

a royal domain (<i>khālṣa</i>) with Abū’l-fatḥ <i>Turkmān</i><a name="FNanchor_1977" id="FNanchor_1977"></a><a href="#Footnote_1977" class="fnanchor">1977</a> as its

with a body of his own Afghāns and of the Panī Afghāns

troublesome attitude. On Wednesday the 15th Ṣafar (Nov. 21st)

<p>(<i>Dec. 21st</i>) On Friday the 16th of the first Rabī‘ a strange

<p>“The details of the momentous event of Friday the 16th of
the first Rabī‘ in the date 933 [Dec. 21st 1526 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>] are as
follows:&mdash;The ill-omened old woman<a name="FNanchor_1981" id="FNanchor_1981"></a><a href="#Footnote_1981" class="fnanchor">1981</a> Ibrāhim’s mother heard<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;305b.</span>
that I ate things from the hands of Hindūstānīs&mdash;the thing
being that three or four months earlier, as I had not seen
Hindūstānī dishes, I had ordered Ibrāhīm’s cooks to be brought
and out of 50 or 60 had kept four. Of this she heard, sent to
Atāwa (Etāwa) for Aḥmad the <i>chāshnīgīr</i>&mdash;in Hindūstān they
call a taster (<i>bakāwal</i>) a <i>chāshnīgīr</i>&mdash;and, having got him,<a name="FNanchor_1982" id="FNanchor_1982"></a><a href="#Footnote_1982" class="fnanchor">1982</a> gave
a <i>tūla</i> of poison, wrapped in a square of paper,&mdash;as has been
mentioned a <i>tūla</i> is rather more than 2 <i>mis̤qāls</i><a name="FNanchor_1983" id="FNanchor_1983"></a><a href="#Footnote_1983" class="fnanchor">1983</a>&mdash;into the hand
of a slave-woman who was to give it to him. That poison
Aḥmad gave to the Hindūstānī cooks in our kitchen, promising
them four <i>parganas</i> if they would get it somehow into the food.
Following the first slave-woman that ill-omened old woman sent
a second to see if the first did or did not give the poison she had
received to Aḥmad. Well was it that Aḥmad put the poison
not into the cooking-pot but on a dish! He did not put it into
the pot because I had strictly ordered the tasters to compel any
Hindūstānīs who were present while food was cooking in the
pots, to taste that food.<a name="FNanchor_1984" id="FNanchor_1984"></a><a href="#Footnote_1984" class="fnanchor">1984</a> Our graceless tasters were neglectful
when the food <i>(āsh</i>) was being dished up. Thin slices of bread
were put on a porcelain dish; on these less than half of the
paper packet of poison was sprinkled, and over this buttered
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[Pg 542]</a></span><span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;306.</span>fritters were laid. It would have been bad if the poison had
been strewn on the fritters or thrown into the pot. In his
confusion, the man threw the larger half into the fire-place.”</p>

<p>“On Friday, late after the Afternoon Prayer, when the cooked
meats were set out, I ate a good deal of a dish of hare and also
much fried carrot, took a few mouthfuls of the poisoned Hindūstānī
food without noticing any unpleasant flavour, took also
a mouthful or two of dried-meat (<i>qāq</i>). Then I felt sick. As
some dried meat eaten on the previous day had had an unpleasant
taste, I thought my nausea due to the dried-meat.
Again and again my heart rose; after retching two or three
times I was near vomiting on the table-cloth. At last I saw it
would not do, got up, went retching every moment of the way
to the water-closet (<i>āb-khāna</i>) and on reaching it vomited much.
Never had I vomited after food, used not to do so indeed while
drinking. I became suspicious; I had the cooks put in ward
and ordered some of the vomit given to a dog and the dog to
be watched. It was somewhat out-of-sorts near the first watch
of the next day; its belly was swollen and however much people
threw stones at it and turned it over, it did not get up. In that
state it remained till mid-day; it then got up; it did not die.
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;306b.</span>One or two of the braves who also had eaten of that dish, vomited
a good deal next day; one was in a very bad state. In the end
all escaped. (<i>Persian</i>) ‘An evil arrived but happily passed on!’

particulars one after another.”</p>

<p>“Monday being Court-day, I ordered the grandees and notables,
amīrs and wazīrs to be present and that those two men and two
women should be brought and questioned. They there related
the particulars of the affair. That taster I had cut in pieces,
that cook skinned alive; one of those women I had thrown

the Sārū-water (Gogra) presumably on the news* of his coming.
Kharīd was plundered and the army turned back.</p>

<p>Humāyūn, in accordance with my arrangements, left Shāh
Mīr Ḥusain and Sl. Junaid with a body of effective braves in
Jūna-pūr, posted Qāẓī Jīā with them, and placed Shaikh Bāyazīd
[<i>Farmūlī</i>] in Aude (Oude). These important matters settled,
he crossed Gang from near Karrah-Mānikpūr and took the
Kālpī road. When he came opposite Kālpī, in which was Jalāl
Khān <i>Jik-hat’s</i> (son) ‘Ālam Khān who had sent me dutiful
letters but had not waited on me himself, he sent some-one to
chase fear from ‘Ālam Khān’s heart and so brought him along
(to Āgra).</p>

<p>Humāyūn arrived and waited on me in the Garden of Eight-paradises<a name="FNanchor_1993" id="FNanchor_1993"></a><a href="#Footnote_1993" class="fnanchor">1993</a>
on Sunday the 3rd of the 2nd Rabī‘ (Jan. 6th
1527 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>). On the same day Khwāja Dost-i-khāwand arrived
from Kābul.</p>

<p>Meantime Mahdī Khwāja’s people began to come in, treading
on one another’s heels and saying, “The Rānā’s advance is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[Pg 545]</a></span>certain. Ḥasan Khān <i>Mīwātī</i> is heard of also as likely to join
him. They must be thought about above all else. It would
favour our fortune, if a troop came ahead of the army to
reinforce Bīāna.”<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;308.</span></p>

<p>Deciding to get to horse, we sent on, to ride light to Bīāna,
the commanders Muḥammad Sl. Mīrzā, Yūnas-i-‘alī, Shāh
Manṣūr <i>Barlās</i>, Kitta Beg, Qismatī<a name="FNanchor_1995" id="FNanchor_1995"></a><a href="#Footnote_1995" class="fnanchor">1995</a> and Būjka.</p>

<p>In the fight with Ibrāhīm, Ḥasan Khān <i>Mīwātī’s</i> son Nāhar
Khān had fallen into our hands; we had kept him as an hostage
and, ostensibly on his account, his father had been making
comings-and-goings with us, constantly asking for him. It now
occurred to several people that if Ḥasan Khān were conciliated
by sending him his son, he would thereby be the more favourably
disposed and his waiting on me might be the better brought
about. Accordingly Nāhar Khān was dressed in a robe of
honour; promises were made to him for his father, and he was
given leave to go. That hypocritical mannikin [Ḥasan Khān]
must have waited just till his son had leave from me to go, for
on hearing of this and while his son as yet had not joined him,
he came out of Alūr (Alwar) and at once joined Rānā Sangā in
Toda(bhīm, Āgra District). It must have been ill-judged to
let his son go just then.</p>

<p>Meantime much rain was falling; parties were frequent; even
Humāyūn was present at them and, abhorrent though it was to
him, sinned<a name="FNanchor_1996" id="FNanchor_1996"></a><a href="#Footnote_1996" class="fnanchor">1996</a> every few days.</p>

Mullā Bābā of Pashāghar (<i>Chaghatāī</i>) and his younger brother
Bābā Shaikh deserted on the way, and went to Kītīn-qarā Sl.
(<i>Aūzbeg</i>), into whose hands Balkh had fallen through the

<p>Shāh Sikandar&mdash;his footing in Ghūrī lost through the surrender
of Balkh&mdash;is about to make over that fort to the Aūzbeg, when
Mullā Bābā and Bābā Shaikh, coming with a few Aūzbegs, take
possession of it. Mīr Hamah, as his fort is close by, has no
help for it; he is for submitting to the Aūzbeg, but a few days
later Mullā Bābā and Bābā Shaikh come with a few Aūzbegs to
Mīr Hamah’s fort, purposing to make the Mīr and his troop
march out and to take them towards Balkh. Mīr Hamah
makes Bābā Shaikh dismount inside the fort, and gives the rest
felt huts (<i>aūtāq</i>) here and there. He slashes at Bābā Shaikh,
puts him and some others in bonds, and sends a man galloping
off to Tīngrī-bīrdī (<i>Qūchīn</i>, in Qūndūz). Tīngrī-bīrdī sends off
Yār-i-‘alī and ‘Abdu’l-lat̤īf with a few effective braves, but before
they reach Mīr Hamah’s fort, Mullā Bābā has arrived there with
his Aūzbegs; he had thought of a hand-to-hand fight (<i>aūrūsh-mūrūsh</i>),
but he can do nothing. Mīr Hamah and his men joined
Tīngrī-bīrdī’s and came to Qūndūz. Bābā Shaikh’s wound must
have been severe; they cut his head off and Mīr Hamah brought
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;309.</span>it (to Āgra) in these same days of respite. I uplifted his head
with favour and kindness, distinguishing him amongst his fellows
and equals. When Bāqī <i>shaghāwal</i> went [to Balkh]<a name="FNanchor_2000" id="FNanchor_2000"></a><a href="#Footnote_2000" class="fnanchor">2000</a> I promised
him a <i>ser</i> of gold for the head of each of the ill-conditioned old

Shaikh’s head, over and above the favours referred to above.<a name="FNanchor_2001" id="FNanchor_2001"></a><a href="#Footnote_2001" class="fnanchor">2001</a></p>

<p>(<i>Feb. 11th</i>) On Monday the 9th of the first Jumāda, we got

three or four days to collect our army and be its rallying-point.<a name="FNanchor_2002" id="FNanchor_2002"></a><a href="#Footnote_2002" class="fnanchor">2002</a>

<p>Into this same camp came the news that owing to Rānā
Sangā’s swift advance with all his army,<a name="FNanchor_2003" id="FNanchor_2003"></a><a href="#Footnote_2003" class="fnanchor">2003</a> our scouts were able
neither to get into the fort (Bīāna) themselves nor to send news
into it. The Bīāna garrison made a rather incautious sally too
far out; the enemy fell on them in some force and put them to

one pagan afoot (<i>yāyāglātīb</i>) and was overcoming him, when
the pagan snatched a sword from one of Kitta Beg’s own
servants and slashed the Beg across the shoulder. Kitta Beg
suffered great pain; he could not come into the Holy-battle
with Rānā Sangā, was long in recovering and always remained
blemished.</p>

<p>Whether because they were themselves afraid, or whether to
frighten others is not known but Qismatī, Shāh Manṣūr <i>Barlās</i>
and all from Bīāna praised and lauded the fierceness and valour
of the pagan army.</p>

<p>Qāsim Master-of-the-horse was sent from the starting-ground
(<i>safar qīlghān yūrt</i>) with his spadesmen, to dig many wells
where the army was next to dismount in the Madhākūr <i>pargana</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>Feb. 16th</i>) Marching out of Āgra on Saturday the 14th of
the first Jumāda, dismount was made where the wells had been
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;310.</span>dug. We marched on next day. It crossed my mind that the
well-watered ground for a large camp was at Sīkrī.<a name="FNanchor_2005" id="FNanchor_2005"></a><a href="#Footnote_2005" class="fnanchor">2005</a> It being
possible that the Pagan was encamped there and in possession
of the water, we arrayed precisely, in right, left and centre. As
Qismatī and Darwīsh-i-muḥammad <i>Sārbān</i> in their comings and
goings had seen and got to know all sides of Bīāna, they were
sent ahead to look for camping-ground on the bank of the Sīkrī-lake
(<i>kūl</i>). When we reached the (Madhākūr) camp, persons
were sent galloping off to tell Mahdī Khwāja and the Bīāna
garrison to join me without delay. Humāyūn’s servant Beg
Mīrak <i>Mughūl</i> was sent out with a few braves to get news of
the Pagan. They started that night, and next morning brought
word that he was heard of as having arrived and dismounted at
a place one <i>kuroh</i> (2 miles) on our side (<i>aīlkārāk</i>) of Basāwar.<a name="FNanchor_2006" id="FNanchor_2006"></a><a href="#Footnote_2006" class="fnanchor">2006</a>
On this same day Mahdī Khwāja and Muḥammad Sl. Mīrzā
rejoined us with the troops that had ridden light to Bīāna.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>o. Discomfiture of a reconnoitring party.</i>)</p>

<p>The begs were appointed in turns for scouting-duty. When
it was ‘Abdu’l-‘azīz’s turn, he went out of Sīkrī, looking neither
before nor behind, right out along the road to Kanwā which
is 5 <i>kuroh</i> (10 m.) away. The Rānā must have been marching
forward; he heard of our men’s moving out in their reinless
(<i>jalāū-sīz</i>) way, and made 4 or 5,000 of his own fall suddenly on
them. With ‘Abdu’l-‘azīz and Mullā Apāq may have been 1000
to 1500 men; they took no stock of their opponents but just<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;310b.</span>
got to grips; they were hurried off at once, many of them being
made prisoner.</p>

<p>On news of this, we despatched Khalīfa’s Muḥibb-i-‘alī with
Khalīfa’s retainers. Mullā Ḥusain and some others <i>aūbrūqsūbrūq</i><a name="FNanchor_2007" id="FNanchor_2007"></a><a href="#Footnote_2007" class="fnanchor">2007</a>*
were sent to support them,<a name="FNanchor_2008" id="FNanchor_2008"></a><a href="#Footnote_2008" class="fnanchor">2008</a> and Muḥammad ‘Alī <i>Jang-jang</i>
also. Presumably it was before the arrival of this first,
Muḥibb-i-‘alī’s, reinforcement that the Pagan had hurried off
‘Abdu’l-‘azīz and his men, taken his standard, martyred Mullā
Ni‘mat, Mullā Dāūd and the younger brother of Mullā Apāq,
with several more. Directly the reinforcement arrived the
pagans overcame T̤āhir-tibrī, the maternal uncle of Khalīfa’s
Muḥibb-i-‘alī, who had not got up with the hurrying reinforcement[?].<a name="FNanchor_2009" id="FNanchor_2009"></a><a href="#Footnote_2009" class="fnanchor">2009</a>
Meantime Muḥibb-i-‘alī even had been thrown down,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[Pg 550]</a></span>but Bāltū getting in from the rear, brought him out. The enemy
pursued for over a <i>kuroh</i> (2 m.), stopped however at the sight of
the black mass of Muḥ. ‘Alī <i>Jang-jang’s</i> troops.</p>

<p>Foot upon foot news came that the foe had come near and
nearer. We put on our armour and our horses’ mail, took our
arms and, ordering the carts to be dragged after us, rode out at
the gallop. We advanced one <i>kuroh</i>. The foe must have
turned aside.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>p. Bābur fortifies his camp.</i>)</p>

<p>For the sake of water, we dismounted with a large lake (<i>kūl</i>)
on one side of us. Our front was defended by carts chained
together*, the space between each two, across which the chains
stretched, being 7 or 8 <i>qārī</i> (<i>circa</i> yards). Must̤afa <i>Rūmī</i> had
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;311.</span>had the carts made in the Rūmī way, excellent carts, very strong
and suitable.<a name="FNanchor_2010" id="FNanchor_2010"></a><a href="#Footnote_2010" class="fnanchor">2010</a> As Ustād ‘Alī-qulī was jealous of him, Must̤afa
was posted to the right, in front of Humāyūn. Where the carts
did not reach to, Khurāsānī and Hindūstānī spadesmen and
miners were made to dig a ditch.</p>

<p>Owing to the Pagan’s rapid advance, to the fighting-work in
Bīāna and to the praise and laud of the pagans made by Shāh
Manṣūr, Qismatī and the rest from Bīāna, people in the army
shewed sign of want of heart. On the top of all this came the
defeat of ‘Abdu’l-‘azīz. In order to hearten our men, and give
a look of strength to the army, the camp was defended and shut
in where there were no carts, by stretching ropes of raw hide on
wooden tripods, set 7 or 8 <i>qārī</i> apart. Time had drawn out to
20 or 25 days before these appliances and materials were fully
ready.<a name="FNanchor_2011" id="FNanchor_2011"></a><a href="#Footnote_2011" class="fnanchor">2011</a></p>

<p class="indent">(<i>q. A reinforcement from Kābul.</i>)</p>

<p>Just at this time there arrived from Kābul Qāsim-i-ḥusain

M. (<i>Bāī-qarā</i>), and with him Aḥmad-i-yūsuf (<i>Aūghlāqchī</i>),
Qawwām-i-aūrdū Shāh and also several single friends of mine,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[Pg 551]</a></span>counting up in all to 500 men. Muḥammad Sharīf, the astrologer
of ill-augury, came with them too, so did Bābā Dost the water-bearer
(<i>sūchī</i>) who, having gone to Kābul for wine, had there<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;311b.</span>
loaded three strings of camels with acceptable Ghaznī wines.</p>

<p>At a time such as this, when, as has been mentioned, the army
was anxious and afraid by reason of past occurrences and vicissitudes,
wild words and opinions, this Muḥammad Sharīf, the
ill-augurer, though he had not a helpful word to say to me, kept
insisting to all he met, “Mars is in the west in these days;<a name="FNanchor_2012" id="FNanchor_2012"></a><a href="#Footnote_2012" class="fnanchor">2012</a>
who comes into the fight from this (east) side will be defeated.”
Timid people who questioned the ill-augurer, became the more
shattered in heart. We gave no ear to his wild words, made no
change in our operations, but got ready in earnest for the fight.</p>

<p>(<i>Feb. 24th</i>) On Sunday the 22nd (of Jumāda 1.) Shaikh
Jamāl was sent to collect all available quiver-wearers from
between the two waters (Ganges and Jumna) and from Dihlī, so
that with this force he might over-run and plunder the Mīwāt
villages, leaving nothing undone which could awaken the enemy’s
anxiety for that side. Mullā Tark-i-‘alī, then on his way from
Kābul, was ordered to join Shaikh Jamāl and to neglect nothing
of ruin and plunder in Mīwāt; orders to the same purport were
given also to Maghfūr the Dīwān. They went; they over-ran
and raided a few villages in lonely corners (<i>būjqāq</i>); they took
some prisoners; but their passage through did not arouse much
anxiety!</p>

unto evil</i>,”<a name="FNanchor_2024" id="FNanchor_2024"></a><a href="#Footnote_2024" class="fnanchor">2024</a> (and again) “<i>This is the bounty of God</i>; <i>He will give

<p>Our motive for these remarks and for repeating these statements
is that, by reason of human frailty, of the customs of
kings and of the great, all of us, from the Shāh to the sipāhī, in
the heyday of our youth, have transgressed and done what we
ought not to have done. After some days of sorrow and
repentance, we abandoned evil practices one by one, and the
gates of retrogression became closed. But the renunciation of
wine, the greatest and most indispensable of renunciations,
remained under a veil in the chamber of deeds <i>pledged to appear
in due season</i>, and did not show its countenance until the
glorious hour when we had put on the garb of the holy warrior
and had encamped with the army of Islām over against the
infidels in order to slay them. On this occasion I received
a secret inspiration and heard an infallible voice say “<i>Is not the
time yet come unto those who believe, that their hearts should
humbly submit to the admonition of God, and that truth which
hath been revealed?</i>”<a name="FNanchor_2026" id="FNanchor_2026"></a><a href="#Footnote_2026" class="fnanchor">2026</a> Thereupon we set ourselves to extirpate
the things of wickedness, and we earnestly knocked at the gates
of repentance. The Guide of Help assisted us, according to the
saying “<i>Whoever knocks and re-knocks, to him it will be opened</i>”,
and an order was given that with the Holy War there should
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;313b.</span>begin the still greater war which has to be waged against
sensuality. In short, we declared with sincerity that <i>we would
subjugate our passions</i>, and I engraved on the tablet of my heart
“<i>I turn unto Thee with repentance, and I am the first of true
believers</i>”.<a name="FNanchor_2027" id="FNanchor_2027"></a><a href="#Footnote_2027" class="fnanchor">2027</a> And I made public the resolution to abstain from
wine, which had been hidden in the treasury of my breast. The
victorious servants, in accordance with the illustrious order,
dashed upon the earth of contempt and destruction the flagons
and the cups, and the other utensils in gold and silver, which in
their number and their brilliance were like the stars of the
firmament. They dashed them in pieces, as, God willing! soon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[Pg 555]</a></span>will be dashed the gods of the idolaters,&mdash;and they distributed
the fragments among the poor and needy. By the blessing of
this acceptable repentance, many of the courtiers, by virtue of
the saying that <i>men follow the religion of their kings</i>, embraced
abstinence at the same assemblage, and entirely renounced the
use of wine, and up till now crowds of our subjects hourly
attain this auspicious happiness. I hope that in accordance
with the saying “<i>He who incites to good deeds has the same
reward as he who does them</i>” the benefit of this action will react
on the royal fortune and increase it day by day by victories.</p>

<p>After carrying out this design an universal decree was issued
that in the imperial dominions&mdash;May God protect them from<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;314.</span>
every danger and calamity&mdash;no-one shall partake of strong
drink, or engage in its manufacture, nor sell it, nor buy it or
possess it, nor convey it or fetch it. “<i>Beware of touching it.</i>”
“<i>Perchance this will give you prosperity.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_2028" id="FNanchor_2028"></a><a href="#Footnote_2028" class="fnanchor">2028</a></p>

<p>In thanks for these great victories,<a name="FNanchor_2029" id="FNanchor_2029"></a><a href="#Footnote_2029" class="fnanchor">2029</a> and as a thank-offering
for God’s acceptance of repentance and sorrow, the ocean of the
royal munificence became commoved, and those waves of kindness,
which are the cause of the civilization of the world and of
the glory of the sons of Adam, were displayed,&mdash;and throughout
all the territories the tax (<i>tamghā</i>) on Musalmāns was
abolished,&mdash;though its yield was more than the dreams of
avarice, and though it had been established and maintained by
former rulers,&mdash;for it is a practice outside of the edicts of the
Prince of Apostles (Muḥammad). So a decree was passed that
in no city, town, road, ferry, pass, or port, should the tax be
levied or exacted. No alteration whatsoever of this order is
to be permitted. “<i>Whoever after hearing it makes any change
therein, the sin of such change will be upon him.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_2030" id="FNanchor_2030"></a><a href="#Footnote_2030" class="fnanchor">2030</a></p>

<p>The proper course (<i>sabīl</i>) for all who shelter under the shade of
the royal benevolence, whether they be Turk, Tājik, ‘Arab, Hindī,
or Fārsī (Persian), peasants or soldiers, of every nation or tribe
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[Pg 556]</a></span>of the sons of Adam, is to strengthen themselves by the tenets
of religion, and to be full of hope and prayer for the dynasty
which is linked with eternity, and to adhere to these ordinances,
and not in any way to transgress them. It behoves all to act
according to this <i>farmān</i>; they are to accept it as authentic
when it comes attested by the Sign-Manual.</p>

had collected quiver-wearers from Between-the-two-waters

prisoner; Khwāja Zāhid abandoned Saṃbal and went off;
Sl. Muḥammad <i>Dūldāī</i> came from Qanūj to me; the Gūālīār
pagans laid siege to that fort; ‘Ālam Khān when sent to
reinforce it, did not go to Gūālīār but to his own district. Every

Pagan. We gave attention to none of them but went straight
on with our own affair.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>v. Bābur advances to fight.</i>)</p>

<p>The apparatus and appliances, the carts and wheeled tripods

forward on New Year’s Day,<a name="FNanchor_2035" id="FNanchor_2035"></a><a href="#Footnote_2035" class="fnanchor">2035</a> Tuesday, the 9th of the second<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;315b.</span>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[Pg 558]</a></span>moving in front of us, with Ustād ‘Alī-qulī and all the matchlock-men
ranged behind them in order that these men, being on foot,
should not be left behind the array but should advance with it.</p>

<p>When the various divisions, right, left and centre, had gone
each to its place, I galloped from one to another to give
encouragement to begs, braves, and <i>sipāhīs</i>. After each man
had had assigned to him his post and usual work with his
company, we advanced, marshalled on the plan determined, for
as much as one <i>kuroh</i> (2 m.)<a name="FNanchor_2037" id="FNanchor_2037"></a><a href="#Footnote_2037" class="fnanchor">2037</a> and then dismounted.</p>

<p>The Pagan’s men, for their part, were on the alert; they
came from their side, one company after another.</p>

<p>The camp was laid out and strongly protected by ditch and
carts. As we did not intend to fight that day, we sent a few
unmailed braves ahead, who were to get to grips with the enemy
and thus take an omen. They made a few pagans prisoner,
cut off and brought in their heads. Malik Qāsim also cut off
and brought in a few heads; he did well. By these successes
the hearts of our men became very strong.</p>

<p>When we marched on next day, I had it in my mind to
fight, but Khalīfa and other well-wishers represented that the
camping-ground previously decided on was near and that it
would favour our fortunes if we had a ditch and defences made
there and went there direct. Khalīfa accordingly rode off to get
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;316.</span>the ditch dug; he settled its position with the spades-men,
appointed overseers of the work and returned to us.

<p>The successive gifts of the Almighty are the cause of frequent

every thanksgiving is followed by a mercy. To render full
thanks is beyond men’s power; the mightiest are helpless to
discharge their obligations. Above all, adequate thanks cannot
be rendered for a benefit than which none is greater in the
world and nothing is more blessed, in the world to come, to wit,
victory over most powerful infidels and dominion over wealthiest
heretics, “<i>these are the unbelievers</i>, <i>the wicked</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_2041" id="FNanchor_2041"></a><a href="#Footnote_2041" class="fnanchor">2041</a> In the eyes of

to God! that this great blessing and mighty boon, which from
the cradle until now has been the real object of this right-thinking
mind (Bābur’s), has now manifested itself by the graciousness of
the King of the worlds; the Opener who dispenses his treasures

glorious <i>ghāzīs</i>. By the help of our victorious soldiers the
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;317.</span>standards of Islām have been raised to the highest pinnacles.
The account of this auspicious fortune is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[Pg 561]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">(<i>b. Rānā Sangā and his forces.</i>)</p>

<p>When the flashing-swords of our Islām-guarded soldiers had
illuminated the land of Hindūstān with rays of victory and
conquest, as has been recorded in former letters-of-victory,<a name="FNanchor_2044" id="FNanchor_2044"></a><a href="#Footnote_2044" class="fnanchor">2044</a>
the Divine favour caused our standards to be upreared in the
territories of Dihlī, Āgra, Jūn-pūr, Kharīd,<a name="FNanchor_2045" id="FNanchor_2045"></a><a href="#Footnote_2045" class="fnanchor">2045</a> Bihār, <i>etc.</i>, when
many chiefs, both pagans and Muḥammadans submitted to our
generals and shewed sincere obedience to our fortunate Nawāb.
But Rānā Sangā the pagan who in earlier times breathed
submissive to the Nawāb,<a name="FNanchor_2046" id="FNanchor_2046"></a><a href="#Footnote_2046" class="fnanchor">2046</a> now <i>was puffed up with pride and
became of the number of unbelievers</i>.<a name="FNanchor_2047" id="FNanchor_2047"></a><a href="#Footnote_2047" class="fnanchor">2047</a> Satan-like he threw back
his head and collected an army of accursed heretics, thus
gathering a rabble-rout of whom some wore the accursed torque
(<i>t̤auq</i>), the <i>zīnār</i>,<a name="FNanchor_2048" id="FNanchor_2048"></a><a href="#Footnote_2048" class="fnanchor">2048</a> on the neck, some had in the skirt the
calamitous thorn of apostacy.<a name="FNanchor_2049" id="FNanchor_2049"></a><a href="#Footnote_2049" class="fnanchor">2049</a> Previous to the rising in Hindūstān
of the Sun of dominion and the emergence there of the
light of the Shāhanshāh’s Khalīfate [<i>i.e.</i> Bābur’s] the authority
of that execrated pagan (Sangā)&mdash;<i>at the Judgment Day he shall
have no friend</i>,<a name="FNanchor_2050" id="FNanchor_2050"></a><a href="#Footnote_2050" class="fnanchor">2050</a> was such that not one of all the exalted
sovereigns of this wide realm, such as the Sult̤ān of Dihlī, the<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;317b.</span>
Sult̤ān of Gujrāt and the Sult̤ān of Mandū, could cope with this
evil-dispositioned one, without the help of other pagans; one
and all they cajoled him and temporized with him; and he had
this authority although the rājas and rāīs of high degree, who
obeyed him in this battle, and the governors and commanders
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[Pg 562]</a></span>who were amongst his followers in this conflict, had not obeyed
him in any earlier fight or, out of regard to their own dignity,
been friendly with him. Infidel standards dominated some
200 towns in the territories of Islām; in them mosques and
shrines fell into ruin; from them the wives and children of the
Faithful were carried away captive. So greatly had his forces
grown that, according to the Hindū calculation by which one
<i>lak</i> of revenue should yield 100 horsemen, and one <i>krūr</i> of
revenue, 10,000 horsemen, the territories subject to the Pagan
(Sangā) yielding 10 <i>krūrs</i>, should yield him 100,000 horse.
Many noted pagans who hitherto had not helped him in battle,
now swelled his ranks out of hostility to the people of Islām.
Ten powerful chiefs, each the leader of a pagan host, uprose in
rebellion, as smoke rises, and linked themselves, as though
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;318.</span>enchained, to that perverse one (Sangā); and this infidel decade
who, unlike the blessed ten,<a name="FNanchor_2051" id="FNanchor_2051"></a><a href="#Footnote_2051" class="fnanchor">2051</a> uplifted misery-freighted standards
which <i>denounce unto them excruciating punishment</i>,<a name="FNanchor_2052" id="FNanchor_2052"></a><a href="#Footnote_2052" class="fnanchor">2052</a> had many
dependants, and troops, and wide-extended lands. As, for
instance, Ṣalāḥu’d-dīn<a name="FNanchor_2053" id="FNanchor_2053"></a><a href="#Footnote_2053" class="fnanchor">2053</a> had territory yielding 30,000 horse,
Rāwal Ūdai Sīngh of Bāgar had 12,000, Medinī Rāī had 12,000,
Ḥasan Khān of Mīwāt had 12,000, Bār-mal of Īdr had 4,000,
Narpat Hāra had 7,000, Satrvī of Kach (Cutch) had 6,000,
Dharm-deo had 4,000, Bīr-sing-deo had 4,000, and Maḥmūd
Khān, son of Sl. Sikandar, to whom, though he possessed neither
district nor <i>pargana</i>, 10,000 horse had gathered in hope of his
attaining supremacy. Thus, according to the calculation of
Hind, 201,000 was the total of those sundered from salvation.
In brief, that haughty pagan, inwardly blind, and hardened of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[Pg 563]</a></span>heart, having joined with other pagans, dark-fated and doomed
to perdition, advanced to contend with the followers of Islām
and to destroy the foundations of the law of the Prince of Men
(Muḥammad), on whom be God’s blessing! The protagonists

Dajjāl<a name="FNanchor_2054" id="FNanchor_2054"></a><a href="#Footnote_2054" class="fnanchor">2054</a> who, to understanding men, shewed the truth of the

the village of Kānwa, a dependency of Bīāna, hard by a hill
which was 2 <i>kurohs</i> (4 m.) from the enemies of the Faith.
When those accursed infidel foes of Muḥammad’s religion heard
the reverberation of the armies of Islām, they arrayed their
ill-starred forces and moved forward with one heart, relying on
their mountain-like, demon-shaped elephants, as had relied the
Lords of the Elephant<a name="FNanchor_2056" id="FNanchor_2056"></a><a href="#Footnote_2056" class="fnanchor">2056</a> who went to overthrow the sanctuary

right wing of the Faith-garbed troops of Islām and charged
down on Khusrau Kūkūldāsh and Bābā Qashqa’s brother Malik

followed each other to help their men, so we, in our turn, sent

<p>The pagan right wing made repeated and desperate attack on

uplifted the standard of life-sacrifice.</p>

<p>As the conflict and battle lasted long, an imperative order was
issued that the special royal corps (<i>tābīnān-i-khāṣa-i-pādshāhī</i>)<a name="FNanchor_2090" id="FNanchor_2090"></a><a href="#Footnote_2090" class="fnanchor">2090</a>
who, heroes of one hue,<a name="FNanchor_2091" id="FNanchor_2091"></a><a href="#Footnote_2091" class="fnanchor">2091</a> were standing, like tigers enchained,
behind the carts,<a name="FNanchor_2092" id="FNanchor_2092"></a><a href="#Footnote_2092" class="fnanchor">2092</a> should go out on the right and the left of the

battle on both sides. As the True Dawn emerges from its cleft
in the horizon, so they emerged from behind the carts; they
poured a ruddy crepuscule of the blood of those ill-fated pagans
on the nadir of the Heavens, that battle-field; they made fall
from the firmament of existence many heads of the headstrong,
as stars fall from the firmament of heaven. The marvel of the
Age, Ustād ‘Alī-qulī, who with his own appurtenances stood in
front of the centre, did deeds of valour, discharging against the
iron-mantled forts of the infidels<a name="FNanchor_2094" id="FNanchor_2094"></a><a href="#Footnote_2094" class="fnanchor">2094</a> stones of such size that were

would <i>become like carded wool</i>.<a name="FNanchor_2096" id="FNanchor_2096"></a><a href="#Footnote_2096" class="fnanchor">2096</a> Such stones Ustād ‘Alī-qulī
discharged at the iron-clad fortress of the pagan ranks and
by this discharge of stones, and abundance of culverins and
matchlocks(?)<a name="FNanchor_2097" id="FNanchor_2097"></a><a href="#Footnote_2097" class="fnanchor">2097</a> destroyed many of the builded bodies of the<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;323.</span>
pagans. The matchlockmen of the royal centre, in obedience
to orders, going from behind the carts into the midst of the
battle, each one of them made many a pagan taste of the poison
of death. The foot-soldiers, going into a most dangerous place,
made their names to be blazoned amongst those of the forest-tigers
(<i>i.e.</i> heroes) of valour and the champions in the field of
manly deeds. Just at this time came an order from his
Majesty the Khāqān that the carts of the centre should be
advanced; and the gracious royal soul (<i>i.e.</i> Bābur) moved
towards the pagan soldiers, Victory and Fortune on his right,
Prestige and Conquest on his left. On witnessing this event,
the victorious troops followed from all sides; the whole surging
ocean of the army rose in mighty waves; the courage of all the
crocodiles<a name="FNanchor_2098" id="FNanchor_2098"></a><a href="#Footnote_2098" class="fnanchor">2098</a> of that ocean was manifested by the strength of their
deeds; an obscuring cloud of dust o’erspread the sky(?). The
dust that gathered over the battle-field was traversed by the
lightning-flashes of the sword; the Sun’s face was shorn of light
as is a mirror’s back; the striker and the struck, the victor and
the vanquished were commingled, all distinction between them
lost. The Wizard of Time produced such a night that its only
planets were arrows,<a name="FNanchor_2099" id="FNanchor_2099"></a><a href="#Footnote_2099" class="fnanchor">2099</a> its only constellations of fixed stars were
the steadfast squadrons.</p>

round their heads like moths. Between the first and second
Prayers, there was such blaze of combat that the flames thereof
raised standards above the heavens, and the right and left of
the army of Islām rolled back the left and right of the doomed
infidels in one mass upon their centre.</p>

<p>When signs were manifest of the victory of the Strivers and
of the up-rearing of the standards of Islām, those accursed
infidels and wicked unbelievers remained for one hour confounded.
At length, their hearts abandoning life, they fell upon the right

vigorous and there they approached furthest, but the holy warriors,
their minds set on the reward, planted shoots (<i>nihāl</i>) of arrows
in the field of the breast of each one of them, and, such being
their gloomy fate, overthrew them. In this state of affairs, the

the road to Hell, removing from this house of clay to the pit of
perdition. The enemy’s country (<i>dāru’l-ḥarb</i>) was full, as Hell
is full, of wounded who had died on the road. The lowest pit
was gorged with miscreants who had surrendered their souls to
the lord of Hell. In whatever direction one from the army of
Islām hastened, he found everywhere a self-willed one dead;
whatever march the illustrious camp made in the wake of the

<p>On our return to camp, I summoned the Turk amīrs and the

water and much heat on the road.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>f. Mīwāt.</i>)</p>

years or two. They must have made<a name="FNanchor_2126" id="FNanchor_2126"></a><a href="#Footnote_2126" class="fnanchor">2126</a> imperfect submission to
the Dihlī Sult̤āns; the Sult̤āns of Hind,<a name="FNanchor_2127" id="FNanchor_2127"></a><a href="#Footnote_2127" class="fnanchor">2127</a> whether because their<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;326.</span>

in the Mīwāt direction, did not establish order in it, but just
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[Pg 578]</a></span>put up with this amount of (imperfect) submission. For our
own part, we did after the fashion of earlier Sult̤āns; having
conquered Hind, we shewed favour to Ḥasan Khān, but that
thankless and heathenish apostate disregarded our kindness
and benefits, was not grateful for favour and promotion, but
became the mover of all disturbance and the cause of all
misdoing.</p>

<p>When, as has been mentioned, we abandoned the plan
(against Rānā Sangā), we moved to subdue Mīwāt. Having
made 4 night-halts on the way, we dismounted on the bank
of the Mānas-nī<a name="FNanchor_2129" id="FNanchor_2129"></a><a href="#Footnote_2129" class="fnanchor">2129</a> 6 <i>kurohs</i> (12 m.) from Alūr, the present seat
of government in Mīwāt. Ḥasan Khān and his forefathers must
have had their seat<a name="FNanchor_2130" id="FNanchor_2130"></a><a href="#Footnote_2130" class="fnanchor">2130</a> in Tijāra, but when I turned towards
Hindūstan, beat Pahār (or Bihār) Khān and took Lāhor and
Dībālpūr (930 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1524 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>), he bethought himself betimes and
busied himself for a residence (<i>‘imārat</i>) in Fort Alūr (Alwar).</p>

<p>His trusted man, Karm-chand by name, who had come from
him to me in Āgra when his son (Nāhar <i>i.e.</i> Tiger) was with me
there,<a name="FNanchor_2131" id="FNanchor_2131"></a><a href="#Footnote_2131" class="fnanchor">2131</a> came now from that son’s presence in Alūr and asked
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;326b.</span>for peace. ‘Abdu’r-raḥīm <i>shaghāwal</i> went with him to Alūr,
conveying letters of royal favour, and returned bringing Nāhar
Khān who was restored to favour and received <i>parganas</i> worth
several <i>laks</i> for his support.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>g. Rewards to officers.</i>)</p>

<p>Thinking, “What good work Khusrau did in the battle!”
I named him for Alūr and gave him 50 <i>laks</i> for his support,
but unluckily for himself, he put on airs and did not accept
this. Later on it [<i>khẉud</i>, itself] came to be known that
Chīn-tīmūr must have done<a name="FNanchor_2132" id="FNanchor_2132"></a><a href="#Footnote_2132" class="fnanchor">2132</a> that work; guerdon was made

<p>Alūr and an allowance of 15 <i>laks</i> was bestowed on Tardīka
(or, Tardī <i>yakka</i>) who in the flanking-party of the right-hand
(<i>qūl</i>) had done better than the rest. The contents of the Alūr
treasury were bestowed on Humāyūn.</p>

<p>(<i>April 13th</i>) Marching from that camp on Wednesday the
1st of the month of Rajab, we came to within 2 <i>kurohs</i> (4 m.) of
Alūr. I went to see the fort, there spent the night, and next
day went back to camp.</p>

<p>When the oath before-mentioned<a name="FNanchor_2134" id="FNanchor_2134"></a><a href="#Footnote_2134" class="fnanchor">2134</a> was given to great and
small before the Holy-battle with Rānā Sangā, it had been
mentioned<a name="FNanchor_2135" id="FNanchor_2135"></a><a href="#Footnote_2135" class="fnanchor">2135</a> that there would be nothing to hinder leave after<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;327.</span>
this victory, and that leave would be given to anyone wishing
to go away (from Hindūstān). Most of Humāyūn’s men were
from Badakhshān or elsewhere on that side (of Hindū-kūsh);
they had never before been of an army led out for even a month
or two; there had been weakness amongst them before the
fight; on these accounts and also because Kābul was empty of
troops, it was now decided to give Humāyūn leave for Kābul.</p>

<p>(<i>April 11th</i>) Leaving the matter at this, we marched from
Alūr on Thursday the 9th of Rajab, did 4 or 5 <i>kurohs</i> (8-10 m.)
and dismounted on the bank of the Mānas-water.</p>

<p>Mahdī Khwāja also had many discomforts; he too was given
leave for Kābul. The military-collectorate of Bīāna [he held]
was bestowed on Dost Lord-of-the-gate, and, as previously
Etāwa had been named for Mahdī Khwāja,<a name="FNanchor_2136" id="FNanchor_2136"></a><a href="#Footnote_2136" class="fnanchor">2136</a> Mahdī Khwāja’s

I rode out on Sunday (<i>Rajab 12th-April 14th</i>) both to visit
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;327b.</span>these places and to set Humāyūn on his way. After visiting
Fīrūzpūr and its spring on that same day, <i>ma’jūn</i> was eaten.
In the valley where the spring rises, oleanders (<i>kanīr</i>) were
in bloom; the place is not without charm but is over-praised.
I ordered a reservoir of hewn stone, 10 by 10<a name="FNanchor_2139" id="FNanchor_2139"></a><a href="#Footnote_2139" class="fnanchor">2139</a> to be made
where the water widened, spent the night in that valley, next
day rode on and visited the Kūtila lake. It is surrounded by
mountain-skirts. The Mānas-nī is heard-say to go into it.<a name="FNanchor_2140" id="FNanchor_2140"></a><a href="#Footnote_2140" class="fnanchor">2140</a>
It is a very large lake, from its one side the other side is not
well seen. In the middle of it is rising ground. At its sides
are many small boats, by going off in which the villagers living
near it are said to escape from any tumult or disturbance.
Even on our arrival a few people went in them to the middle of
the lake.</p>

<p>On our way back from the lake, we dismounted in Humāyūn’s
camp. There we rested and ate food, and after having put
robes of honour on him and his begs, bade him farewell at
the Bed-time Prayer, and rode on. We slept for a little at some
place on the road, at shoot of day passed through the <i>pargana</i>
of Kharī, again slept a little, and at length got to our camp
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[Pg 581]</a></span>which had dismounted at Toda-(bhim).<a name="FNanchor_2141" id="FNanchor_2141"></a><a href="#Footnote_2141" class="fnanchor">2141</a> After leaving Toda,

<p>Going on from that place, we halted one night, then
dismounted at a spring situated on the bill of a mountain
between Busāwar and Chausa<a name="FNanchor_2142" id="FNanchor_2142"></a><a href="#Footnote_2142" class="fnanchor">2142</a> (or Jūsa); there awnings were
set up and we committed the sin of <i>ma’jūn</i>. When the army
had passed by this spring, Tardī Beg <i>khāksār</i> had praised it; he
(or we) had come and seen it from on horse-back (<i>sar-asbgi</i>)
and passed on. It is a perfect spring. In Hindūstān where
there are never running-waters,<a name="FNanchor_2143" id="FNanchor_2143"></a><a href="#Footnote_2143" class="fnanchor">2143</a> people seek out the springs
themselves. The rare springs that are found, come oozing
drop by drop (<i>āb-zih</i>) out of the ground, not bubbling up
like springs of those lands.<a name="FNanchor_2144" id="FNanchor_2144"></a><a href="#Footnote_2144" class="fnanchor">2144</a> From this spring comes about
a half-mill-water. It bubbles up on the hill-skirt; meadows
lie round it; it is very beautiful. I ordered an octagonal
reservoir of hewn stone made above<a name="FNanchor_2145" id="FNanchor_2145"></a><a href="#Footnote_2145" class="fnanchor">2145</a> it. While we were at the
border of the spring, under the soothing influence of <i>ma’jūn</i>,
Tardī Beg, contending for its surpassing beauty, said again and
again, (<i>Persian</i>) “Since I am celebrating the beauty of the
place,<a name="FNanchor_2146" id="FNanchor_2146"></a><a href="#Footnote_2146" class="fnanchor">2146</a> a name ought to be settled for it”. ‘Abdu’l-lāh said, “It
must be called the Royal-spring approved of by Tardī Beg.”
This saying caused much joke and laughter.</p>

<p>Dost Lord-of-the-gate coming up from Bīāna, waited on me
at this spring-head. Leaving this place, we visited Bīāna again,<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;328b.</span>
went on to Sīkrī, dismounted there at the side of a garden which
had been ordered made, stayed two days supervising the garden,

a reservoir, all in one piece, cut out of it.</p>

<p>(<i>Jan. 28th</i>) At dawn on Tuesday the 6th of the first Jumāda
we marched from Bahjat Khān’s tank intending to assault
Chandīrī. We dismounted at the side of the middle-tank near
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;334.</span>the fort.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>j. Bad news.</i>)</p>

<p>On this same morning after reaching that ground, Khalīfa
brought a letter or two of which the purport was that the troops
appointed for the East<a name="FNanchor_2204" id="FNanchor_2204"></a><a href="#Footnote_2204" class="fnanchor">2204</a> had fought without consideration, been
beaten, abandoned Laknau, and gone to Qanūj. Seeing that
Khalīfa was much perturbed and alarmed by these news, I said,<a name="FNanchor_2205" id="FNanchor_2205"></a><a href="#Footnote_2205" class="fnanchor">2205</a>
(<i>Persian</i>) “There is no ground for perturbation or alarm;
nothing comes to pass but what is predestined of God. As
this task (Chandīrī) is ahead of us, not a breath must be drawn
about what has been told us. Tomorrow we will assault the
fort; that done, we shall see what comes.”</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>k. Siege of Chandīrī, resumed.</i>)</p>

<p>The enemy must have strengthened just the citadel, and have
posted men by twos and threes in the outer-fort for prudence’
sake. That night our men went up from all round; those few
in the outer-fort did not fight; they fled into the citadel.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">[Pg 595]</a></span></p><p>(<i>Jan. 29th</i>) At dawn on Wednesday the 7th of the first
Jumāda, we ordered our men to arm, go to their posts, provoke
to fight, and attack each from his place when I rode out with
drum and standard.</p>

<p>I myself, dismissing drum and standard till the fighting should
grow hot, went to amuse myself by watching Ustād ‘Alī-qulī’s
stone-discharge.<a name="FNanchor_2206" id="FNanchor_2206"></a><a href="#Footnote_2206" class="fnanchor">2206</a> Nothing was effected by it because his ground
had no fall (<i>yāghdā</i>) and because the fort-walls, being entirely<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;334b.</span>
of stone, were extremely strong.</p>

<p>That the citadel of Chandīrī stands on a hill has been said
already. Down one side of this hill runs a double-walled road
(<i>dū-tahī</i>) to water.<a name="FNanchor_2207" id="FNanchor_2207"></a><a href="#Footnote_2207" class="fnanchor">2207</a> This is the one place for attack; it had
been assigned as the post of the right and left hands and royal
corps of the centre.<a name="FNanchor_2208" id="FNanchor_2208"></a><a href="#Footnote_2208" class="fnanchor">2208</a> Hurled though assault was from every
side, the greatest force was here brought to bear. Our braves did
not turn back, however much the pagans threw down stones and
flung flaming fire upon them. At length Shāhīm the centurion<a name="FNanchor_2209" id="FNanchor_2209"></a><a href="#Footnote_2209" class="fnanchor">2209</a>
got up where the <i>dū-tahī</i> wall touches the wall of the outer fort;
braves swarmed up in other places; the <i>dū-tahī</i> was taken.</p>

<p>Not even as much as this did the pagans fight in the citadel;
when a number of our men swarmed up, they fled in haste.<a name="FNanchor_2210" id="FNanchor_2210"></a><a href="#Footnote_2210" class="fnanchor">2210</a> In
a little while they came out again, quite naked, and renewed the
fight; they put many of our men to flight; they made them fly
(<i>āuchūrdīlār</i>) over the ramparts; some they cut down and killed.
Why they had gone so suddenly off the walls seems to have
been that they had taken the resolve of those who give up
a place as lost; they put all their ladies and beauties (<i>ṣūratīlār</i>)
to death, then, looking themselves to die, came naked out
to fight. Our men attacking, each one from his post, drove<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;335.</span>
them from the walls whereupon 2 or 300 of them entered
Medinī Rāo’s house and there almost all killed one another in
this way:&mdash;one having taken stand with a sword, the rest
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[Pg 596]</a></span>eagerly stretched out the neck for his blow.<a name="FNanchor_2211" id="FNanchor_2211"></a><a href="#Footnote_2211" class="fnanchor">2211</a> Thus went the

<p>We had come to Chandīrī meaning, after taking it, to move
against Rāīsīng, Bhīlsān, and Sārangpūr, pagan lands dependent
on the pagan Ṣalāḥu’d-dīn, and, these taken, to move on
Rānā Sangā in Chītūr. But as that bad news had come, the
begs were summoned, matters were discussed, and decision made
that the proper course was first to see to the rebellion of those
malignants. Chandīrī was given to the Aḥmad Shāh already
mentioned, a grandson of Sl. Nāṣiru’d-dīn; 50 <i>laks</i> from it were
made <i>khalṣa</i>;<a name="FNanchor_2224" id="FNanchor_2224"></a><a href="#Footnote_2224" class="fnanchor">2224</a> Mullā Apāq was entrusted with its military-collectorate,

abandoned Qanūj also and come to Rāprī, and that a strong

Abū’l-muḥammad the lancer must have strengthened it.<a name="FNanchor_2226" id="FNanchor_2226"></a><a href="#Footnote_2226" class="fnanchor">2226</a> There
was delay of 3 or 4 days on one side or other of the river before
the army got across. Once over, we moved march by march
towards Qanūj, sending scouting braves (<i>qāzāq yīgītlār</i>) ahead
to get news of our opponents. Two or three marches from Qanūj,
news was brought that Ma‘rūf’s son had fled on seeing the dark
mass of the news-gatherers, and got away. Bīban, Bāyazīd and
Ma‘rūf, on hearing news of us, crossed Gang (Ganges) and seated
themselves on its eastern bank opposite Qanūj, thinking to prevent
our passage.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>o. A bridge made over the Ganges.</i>)</p>

<p>(<i>Feb. 27th</i>) On Thursday the 6th of the latter Jumāda we
passed Qanūj and dismounted on the western bank of Gang.
Some of the braves went up and down the river and took boats<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;336b.</span>
by force,<a name="FNanchor_2227" id="FNanchor_2227"></a><a href="#Footnote_2227" class="fnanchor">2227</a> bringing in 30 or 40, large or small. Mīr Muḥammad
the raftsman was sent to find a place convenient for making
a bridge and to collect requisites for making it. He came back
approving of a place about a <i>kuroh</i> (2 m.) below the camp.
Energetic overseers were told off for the work. Ustād ‘Alī-qulī
placed the mortar for his stone-discharge near where the bridge
was to be and shewed himself active in discharging it. Muṣt̤afa
<i>Rūmī</i> had the culverin-carts crossed over to an island below
the place for the bridge, and from that island began a culverin-discharge.
Excellent matchlock fire was made from a post<a name="FNanchor_2228" id="FNanchor_2228"></a><a href="#Footnote_2228" class="fnanchor">2228</a>
raised above the bridge. Malik Qāsim <i>Mughūl</i> and a very few
men went across the river once or twice and fought excellently
(<i>yakhshīlār aūrūshtīlār</i>). With equal boldness Bābā Sl. and
Darwīsh Sl. also crossed, but went with the insufficient number
of from 10 to 15 men; they went after the Evening Prayer and
came back without fighting, with nothing done; they were much
blamed for this crossing of theirs. At last Malik Qāsim, grown
bold, attacked the enemy’s camp and, by shooting arrows into
it, drew him out (?);<a name="FNanchor_2229" id="FNanchor_2229"></a><a href="#Footnote_2229" class="fnanchor">2229</a> he came with a mass of men and an
elephant, fell on Malik Qāsim and hurried him off. Malik
Qāsim got into a boat, but before it could put off, the elephant<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;337.</span>
came up and swamped it. In that encounter Malik Qāsim died.</p>

<p>In the days before the bridge was finished Ustād ‘Alī-qulī did
good things in stone-discharge (<i>yakhshīlār tāsh aītī</i>), on the first
day discharging 8 stones, on the second 16, and going on equally
well for 3 or 4 days. These stones he discharged from the Ghāzī-mortar
which is so-called because it was used in the battle with
Rānā Sangā the pagan. There had been another and larger
mortar which burst after discharging one stone.<a name="FNanchor_2230" id="FNanchor_2230"></a><a href="#Footnote_2230" class="fnanchor">2230</a> The matchlockmen
made a mass (<i>qālīn</i>) of discharges, bringing down many

away (?) and men and horses passing-by.<a name="FNanchor_2231" id="FNanchor_2231"></a><a href="#Footnote_2231" class="fnanchor">2231</a></p>

<p>(<i>March 11th</i>) On Wednesday the 19th of the latter Jumāda
the bridge being almost finished, we marched to its head. The

from completion.<a name="FNanchor_2232" id="FNanchor_2232"></a><a href="#Footnote_2232" class="fnanchor">2232</a></p>

<p>(<i>March 12th</i>) The bridge being ready on Thursday, a small
body of foot-soldiers and Lāhorīs went over. Fighting as small
followed.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>p. Encounter with the Afghāns.</i>)</p>

<p>(<i>March 13th</i>) On Friday the royal corps, and the right and
left hands of the centre crossed on foot. The whole body of
Afghāns, armed, mounted, and having elephants with them,
attacked us. They hurried off our men of the left hand, but
our centre itself (<i>i.e.</i> the royal corps) and the right hand stood
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;337b.</span>firm, fought, and forced the enemy to retire. Two men from
these divisions had galloped ahead of the rest; one was dismounted
and taken; the horse of the other was struck again
and again, had had enough,<a name="FNanchor_2233" id="FNanchor_2233"></a><a href="#Footnote_2233" class="fnanchor">2233</a> turned round and when amongst
our men, fell down. On that day 7 or 8 heads were brought
in; many of the enemy had arrow or matchlock wounds.
Fighting went on till the Other Prayer. That night all who
had gone across were made to return; if (more) had gone over
on that Saturday’s eve,<a name="FNanchor_2234" id="FNanchor_2234"></a><a href="#Footnote_2234" class="fnanchor">2234</a> most of the enemy would probably
have fallen into our hands, but this was in my mind:&mdash;Last
year we marched out of Sīkrī to fight Rānā Sangā on Tuesday,
New-year’s-day, and crushed that rebel on Saturday; this year
we had marched to crush these rebels on Wednesday, New-year’s-day,<a name="FNanchor_2235" id="FNanchor_2235"></a><a href="#Footnote_2235" class="fnanchor">2235</a>
and it would be one of singular things, if we beat
them on Sunday. So thinking, we did not make the rest of

but stood arrayed a long way off.</p>

<p>(<i>Sunday March 15th-Jumāda II. 23rd</i>) On this day the
carts were taken over, and at this same dawn the army was
ordered to cross. At beat of drum news came from our scouts
that the enemy had fled. Chīn-tīmūr Sl. was ordered to lead
his army in pursuit and the following leaders also were made
pursuers who should move with the Sult̤ān and not go beyond
his word:&mdash;Muḥammad ‘Alī <i>Jang-jang</i>, Ḥusamu’d-dīn ‘Alī (son)

Tāshkīnt, and Red Walī. I crossed at the Sunnat Prayer.

and Sīrd[a]. Till today Shaikh Bāyazīd will have been on the
other side of the Sīrd[a] opposite Aūd, sending letters to the
Sult̤ān and discussing with him, but the Sult̤ān getting to know
his deceitfulness, sent word to Qarācha at the Mid-day Prayer
and made ready to cross the river. On Qarācha’s joining him,
they crossed at once to where were some 50 horsemen with 3 or
4 elephants. These men could make no stand; they fled; a few
having been dismounted, the heads cut off were sent in.</p>

<p>Following the Sult̤ān there crossed over Bī-khūb (var. Nī-khūb)
Sl. and Tardī Beg (the brother) of Qūj Beg, and Bābā Chuhra
(the Brave), and Bāqī <i>shaghāwal</i>. Those who had crossed first
and gone on, pursued Shaikh Bāyazīd till the Evening Prayer,
but he flung himself into the jungle and escaped. Chīn-tīmūr
dismounted late on the bank of standing-water, rode on at midnight
after the rebel, went as much as 40 <i>kurohs</i> (80 m.), and
came to where Shaikh Bāyazīd’s family and relations (<i>nisba</i>?)
had been; they however must have fled. He sent gallopers
off in all directions from that place; Bāqī <i>shaghāwal</i> and a few
braves drove the enemy like sheep before them, overtook the
family and brought in some Afghān prisoners.</p>

<p>We stayed a few days on that ground (near Aūd) in order to
settle the affairs of Aūd. People praised the land lying along
the Sīrd[a] 7 or 8 <i>kurohs</i> (14-16 m.) above Aūd, saying it was

<p class="center">TRANSLATOR’S NOTE.</p>

<p>Here, in all known texts of the <i>Bābur-nāma</i> there is a break
of the narrative between April 2nd and Sep. 18th 1528 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>-Jumāda
II. 12th 934 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> and Muḥarram 3rd 935 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>, which,
whether intentional or accidental, is unexplained by Bābur’s
personal circumstances. It is likely to be due to a loss of pages
from Bābur’s autograph manuscript, happening at some time
preceding the making of either of the Persian translations of his
writings and of the Elphinstone and Ḥaidarābād transcripts.
Though such a loss might have occurred easily during the storm
chronicled on f. 376<i>b</i>, it seems likely that Bābur would then have
become aware of it and have made it good. A more probable
explanation of the loss is the danger run by Humāyūn’s library
during his exile from rule in Hindūstān, at which same time
may well have occurred the seeming loss of the record of 936
and 937 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span></p>

<p class="indent">(<i>a. Transactions of the period of the lacuna.</i>)</p>

<p>Mr. Erskine notes (<i>Mems.</i> p. 381 n.) that he found the gap in
all MSS. he saw and that historians of Hindūstān throw no light
upon the transactions of the period. Much can be gleaned however
as to Bābur’s occupations during the 5-1/2 months of the <i>lacuna</i>
from his chronicle of 935 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> which makes several references to
occurrences of “last year” and also allows several inferences to
be drawn. From this source it becomes known that the Afghān
campaign the record of which is broken by the gap, was carried
on and that in its course Bābur was at Jūn-pūr (f. 365), Chausa
(f. 365<i>b</i>) and Baksara (f. 366-366<i>b</i>); that he swam the Ganges
(f. 366<i>b</i>), bestowed Sarūn on a Farmūlī Shaikh-zāda (f. 374<i>b</i> and
f. 377), negociated with Rānā Sangā’s son Bikramājīt (f. 342<i>b</i>),
ordered a Chār-bāgh laid out (f. 340), and was ill for 40 days

recalled ‘Askarī (f. 339), sent Khwāja Dost-i-khāwand on family
affairs to Kābul (f. 345<i>b</i>), and was much pre-occupied by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">[Pg 604]</a></span>

<p>It is not easy to follow the dates of events in 935 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> because
in many instances only the day of the week or a “next day”
is entered. I am far from sure that one passage at least now
found <i>s.a.</i> 935 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> does not belong to 934 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> It is not in the
Ḥai. Codex (where its place would have been on f. 363<i>b</i>), and, so
far as I can see, does not fit with the dates of 935 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> It will
be considered with least trouble with its context and my notes
(<i>q.v.</i> f. 363<i>b</i> and ff. 366-366<i>b</i>).</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>b. Remarks on the lacuna.</i>)</p>

<p>One interesting biographical topic is likely to have found
mention in the missing record, <i>viz.</i> the family difficulties which
led to ‘Askarī’s supersession by Kāmrān in the government of
Multān (f. 359).</p>

<p>Another is the light an account of the second illness of 934 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>
might have thrown on a considerable part of the Collection of
verses already written in Hindūstān and now known to us as the
<i>Rāmpūr Dīwān</i>. The <i>Bābur-nāma</i> allows the dates of much of
its contents to be known, but there remain poems which seem
prompted by the self-examination of some illness not found in
the <i>B.N.</i> It contains the metrical version of Khwāja ‘Ubaidu’l-lāh’s
<i>Wālidiyyah</i> of which Bābur writes on f. 346 and it is dated
Monday Rabī‘ II. 15th 935 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (Dec. 29th 1528 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>). I surmise
that the reflective verses following the <i>Wālidiyyah</i> belong to the
40 days’ illness of 934 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> <i>i.e.</i> were composed in the period of
the <i>lacuna</i>. The Collection, as it is in the “Rāmpūr Dīwān”, went
to a friend who was probably Khwāja Kalān; it may have been
the only such collection made by Bābur. No other copy of it
has so far been found. It has the character of an individual gift
with verses specially addressed to its recipient. Any light upon
it which may have vanished with pages of 934 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> is an appreciable
loss.</p>

cut out an octagonal, roofed tank. North of this tank the

<p>(<i>Sep. 28th</i>) Next day (<i>Muḥ. 13th</i>) at the Mid-day Prayer we

saw the <i>‘imārat</i> called Bādalgar<a name="FNanchor_2282" id="FNanchor_2282"></a><a href="#Footnote_2282" class="fnanchor">2282</a> which is part of Mān-sing’s
fort (<i>qila‘</i>), went through the Hātī-pūl and across the fort to
a place called Urwā (Urwāh), which is a valley-bottom (<i>qūl</i>) on its
western side. Though Urwā is outside the fort-wall running
along the top of the hill, it has two stages (<i>murtaba</i>) of high
wall at its mouth. The higher of these walls is some 30 or 40
<i>qārī</i> (yards) high; this is the longer one; at each end it joins<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;342.</span>
the wall of the fort. The second wall curves in and joins the
middle part of the first; it is the lower and shorter of the two.
This curve of wall will have been made for a water-thief;<a name="FNanchor_2283" id="FNanchor_2283"></a><a href="#Footnote_2283" class="fnanchor">2283</a>
within it is a stepped well (<i>wā’īn</i>) in which water is reached by
10 or 15 steps. Above the Gate leading from the valley to this
walled-well the name of Sl. Shihābu’d-dīn Aīltmīsh (Altamsh)
is inscribed, with the date 630 (<span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1233 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>). Below this
outer wall and outside the fort there is a large lake which seems
to dwindle (at times) till no lake remains; from it water goes
to the water-thief. There are two other lakes inside Urwā the
water of which those who live in the fort prefer to all other.</p>

<p>Three sides of Urwā are solid rock, not the red rock of Bīāna
but one paler in colour. On these sides people have cut out
idol-statues, large and small, one large statue on the south side
being perhaps 20 <i>qārī</i> (yds.) high.<a name="FNanchor_2284" id="FNanchor_2284"></a><a href="#Footnote_2284" class="fnanchor">2284</a> These idols are shewn quite

from which useful vegetables (<i>sabzī kārlīklār</i>), flowers and trees
are grown. Urwā is not a bad place; it is shut in (T. <i>tūr</i>); the
idols are its defect; I, for my part, ordered them destroyed.<a name="FNanchor_2285" id="FNanchor_2285"></a><a href="#Footnote_2285" class="fnanchor">2285</a></p>

<p class="indent">(<i>h. A son of Rānā Sangā negociates with Bābur.</i>)</p>

<p>(<i>Sep. 29th</i>) On Tuesday the 14th of the month came people
from Rānā Sangā’s second son, Bikramājīt by name, who with
his mother Padmāwatī was in the fort of Rantanbūr. Before
I rode out for Gūālīār,<a name="FNanchor_2287" id="FNanchor_2287"></a><a href="#Footnote_2287" class="fnanchor">2287</a> others had come from his great and
trusted Hindū, Asūk by name, to indicate Bikramājīt’s submission
and obeisance and ask a subsistence-allowance of 70 <i>laks</i>
for him; it had been settled at that time that <i>parganas</i> to the
amount he asked should be bestowed on him, his men were given
leave to go, with tryst for Gūālīār which we were about to visit.
They came into Gūālīār somewhat after the trysting-day. The
Hindū Asūk<a name="FNanchor_2288" id="FNanchor_2288"></a><a href="#Footnote_2288" class="fnanchor">2288</a> is said to be a near relation of Bikramājīt’s mother
Padmāwatī; he, for his part, set these particulars forth father-like

and golden belt, accepting which Sangā let him go free. That
crown-cap and golden belt must have become Bikramājīt’s; his
elder brother Ratan-sī, now Rānā of Chītūr in his father’s place,
had asked for them but Bikramājīt had not given them up,<a name="FNanchor_2290" id="FNanchor_2290"></a><a href="#Footnote_2290" class="fnanchor">2290</a> and
now made the men he sent to me, speak to me about them, and
ask for Bīāna in place of Rantanbūr. We led them away from
the Bīāna question and promised Shamsābād in exchange for
Rantanbūr. To-day (<i>Muḥ. 14th</i>) they were given a nine days’
tryst for Bīāna, were dressed in robes of honour, and allowed
to go.</p>

is a large lake; above it the water comes flowing through solid
rock; there is solid rock also below the fall. A lake forms
wherever the water falls. On the banks of the water lie piece
after piece of rock as if for seats, but the water is said not
always to be there. We sat down above the fall and ate <i>ma‘jūn</i>,
went up-stream to visit its source (<i>badayat</i>), returned, got out on
higher ground, and stayed while musicians played and reciters

call <i>tindū</i>, was pointed out to those who had not seen it before.
We went down the hill and, between the Evening and Bed-time
Prayers, rode away, slept at a place reached near the second
watch (midnight), and with the on-coming of the first watch of
day (6 a.m. <i>Muḥ. 16th-Oct. 1st</i>) reached the Chār-bāgh and dismounted.</p>

<p>(<i>Oct. 4th</i>) On Sunday the 19th of the month, we rode before
dawn from the Chār-bāgh, crossed the Kawārī-water and took our
nooning (<i>tūshlāndūk</i>). After the Mid-day Prayer we rode on,

help of the water, to get the sides to one height. They got the
face up straight just before the Other Prayer, were then ordered
to fill the tank with water, by help of the water made the sides<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;344b.</span>

we dismounted somewhere and slept; I myself could
not sleep on account of pain in my ear, whether caused by cold,

ourselves from that place, and in the first watch dismounted at

the mīrzās, sult̤āns, Turk and Hind amīrs were summoned for

must move in some direction; that ‘Askarī should go in advance

Gang (Ganges), and march in whatever direction favoured fortune.

off, on Saturday the 22nd of the month, to the amīrs of the East
headed by Sl. Junaid <i>Barlās</i>. His word-of-mouth message was,
that ‘Askarī was being sent on before the fighting apparatus,
culverin, cart and matchlock, was ready; that it was the royal
order for the sult̤āns and amīrs of the far side of Gang to muster
in ‘Askarī’s presence, and, after consultation with well-wishers
on that side, to move in whatever direction, God willing! might
favour fortune; that if there should be work needing me, please
God! I would get to horse as soon as the person gone with the
(16 days) tryst (<i>mī‘ād</i>) had returned; that explicit representation
should be made as to whether the Bengali (Nas̤rat Shāh) were
friendly and single-minded; that, if nothing needed my presence

at once;<a name="FNanchor_2367" id="FNanchor_2367"></a><a href="#Footnote_2367" class="fnanchor">2367</a> and that after consulting with well-wishers, they

dark mass at 100,000; on the other hand, the Aūzbegs said
they themselves were 100,000. The Qīzīl-bāsh leader (<i>ādam</i>)

<p>We moved from Ābāpūr while 4 <i>garīs</i> of the night remained
(4.30 a.m.). After passing Chandawār at the top of the dawn,
I got into a boat. I landed in front of Rāprī and at the Bed-time
Prayer got to the camp which was at Fatḥpūr.<a name="FNanchor_2455" id="FNanchor_2455"></a><a href="#Footnote_2455" class="fnanchor">2455</a></p>

<p>(<i>Feb. 4th and 5th</i>) Having stayed one day (<i>Friday</i>) at Fatḥpūr,
we got to horse on Saturday (<i>26th</i>) after making ablution (<i>waẓū</i>)
at dawn. We went through the Morning Prayer in assembly near
Rāprī, Maulānā Muḥammad of Fārāb being the leader (<i>imām</i>). At
sun-rise I got into a boat below the great crook<a name="FNanchor_2456" id="FNanchor_2456"></a><a href="#Footnote_2456" class="fnanchor">2456</a> of Rāprī.</p>

<p>Today I put together a line-marker (<i>mist̤ar</i>) of eleven lines<a name="FNanchor_2457" id="FNanchor_2457"></a><a href="#Footnote_2457" class="fnanchor">2457</a>
in order to write the mixed hands of the translation.<a name="FNanchor_2458" id="FNanchor_2458"></a><a href="#Footnote_2458" class="fnanchor">2458</a> Today

heart.<a name="FNanchor_2459" id="FNanchor_2459"></a><a href="#Footnote_2459" class="fnanchor">2459</a></p>

<p>(<i>Feb. 6th</i>) Opposite Jākīn,<a name="FNanchor_2460" id="FNanchor_2460"></a><a href="#Footnote_2460" class="fnanchor">2460</a> one of the Rāprī <i>parganas</i>, we
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;358b.</span>had the boats drawn to the bank and just spent the night in
them. We had them moved on from that place before the dawn
(<i>Sunday 27th</i>), after having gone through the Morning Prayer.
When I was again on board, Pay-master Sl. Muḥammad came,
bringing a servant of Khwāja Kalān, Shamsu’d-dīn Muḥammad,
from whose letters and information particulars about the affairs of
Kābul became known.<a name="FNanchor_2461" id="FNanchor_2461"></a><a href="#Footnote_2461" class="fnanchor">2461</a> Mahdī Khwāja also came when I was in
the boat.<a name="FNanchor_2462" id="FNanchor_2462"></a><a href="#Footnote_2462" class="fnanchor">2462</a> At the Mid-day Prayer I landed in a garden opposite
Etāwa, there bathed (<i>ghusl</i>) in the Jūn, and fulfilled the duty of
prayer. Moving nearer towards Etāwa, we sat down in that
same garden under trees on a height over-looking the river, and
there set the braves to amuse us.<a name="FNanchor_2463" id="FNanchor_2463"></a><a href="#Footnote_2463" class="fnanchor">2463</a> Food ordered by Mahdī
Khwāja, was set before us. At the Evening Prayer we crossed
the river; at the bed-time one we reached camp.</p>

<p>There was a two or three days’ delay on that ground both to
collect the army, and to write letters in answer to those brought
by Shamsu’d-dīn Muḥammad.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>nn. Letters various.</i>)</p>

<p>(<i>Feb. 9th</i>) On Wednesday the last day (<i>30th</i>) of the 1st Jumāda,
we marched from Etāwa, and after doing 8 <i>kurohs</i> (16m.), dismounted
at Mūrī-and-Adūsa.<a name="FNanchor_2464" id="FNanchor_2464"></a><a href="#Footnote_2464" class="fnanchor">2464</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_645" id="Page_645">[Pg 645]</a></span></p>
<p>Several remaining letters for Kābul were written on this same
ground. One to Humāyūn was to this purport:&mdash;If the work
have not yet been done satisfactorily, stop the raiders and thieves
thyself; do not let them embroil the peace now descending
amongst the peoples.<a name="FNanchor_2465" id="FNanchor_2465"></a><a href="#Footnote_2465" class="fnanchor">2465</a> Again, there was this:&mdash;I have made<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;359.</span>
Kābul a crown-domain, let no son of mine covet it. Again:&mdash;that
I had summoned Hind-āl.</p>

<p>Kāmrān, for his part, was written to about taking the best of
care in intercourse with the Shāh-zāda,<a name="FNanchor_2466" id="FNanchor_2466"></a><a href="#Footnote_2466" class="fnanchor">2466</a> about my bestowal on
himself of Multān, making Kābul a crown-domain, and the coming
of my family and train.<a name="FNanchor_2467" id="FNanchor_2467"></a><a href="#Footnote_2467" class="fnanchor">2467</a></p>

<p>As my letter to Khwāja Kalān makes several particulars
known, it is copied in here without alteration:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_2468" id="FNanchor_2468"></a><a href="#Footnote_2468" class="fnanchor">2468</a></p>

<p class="center">
[<span class="smcap">Copy of a Letter to Khwāja Kalān.</span>]<br />
</p>

<p>“After saying ‘Salutation to Khwāja Kalān', the first matter
is that Shamsu’d-dīn Muḥammad has reached Etāwa, and that
the particulars about Kābul are known.”</p>

<p>“Boundless and infinite is my desire to go to those parts.<a name="FNanchor_2469" id="FNanchor_2469"></a><a href="#Footnote_2469" class="fnanchor">2469</a>
Matters are coming to some sort of settlement in Hindūstān;
there is hope, through the Most High, that the work here will soon
be arranged. This work brought to order, God willing! my start
will be made at once.”</p>

<p>“How should a person forget the pleasant things of those
countries, especially one who has repented and vowed to sin no
more? How should he banish from his mind the permitted
flavours of melons and grapes? Taking this opportunity,<a name="FNanchor_2470" id="FNanchor_2470"></a><a href="#Footnote_2470" class="fnanchor">2470</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_646" id="Page_646">[Pg 646]</a></span>a melon was brought to me; to cut and eat it affected me strangely;
I was all tears!”</p>

<p>“The unsettled state<a name="FNanchor_2471" id="FNanchor_2471"></a><a href="#Footnote_2471" class="fnanchor">2471</a> of Kābul had already been written of
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;359b.</span>to me. After thinking matters over, my choice fell on this:&mdash;How
should a country hold together and be strong (<i>marbūt̤
u maẓbūt̤</i>), if it have seven or eight Governors? Under this
aspect of the affair, I have summoned my elder sister (Khān-zāda)
and my wives to Hindūstān, have made Kābul and its
neighbouring countries a crown-domain, and have written in
this sense to both Humāyūn and Kāmrān. Let a capable person
take those letters to the Mīrzās. As you may know already, I had
written earlier to them with the same purport. About the safe-guarding
and prosperity of the country, there will now be no
excuse, and not a word to say. Henceforth, if the town-wall<a name="FNanchor_2472" id="FNanchor_2472"></a><a href="#Footnote_2472" class="fnanchor">2472</a>
be not solid or subjects not thriving, if provisions be not in store
or the Treasury not full, it will all be laid on the back of the
inefficiency of the Pillar-of-the State.”<a name="FNanchor_2473" id="FNanchor_2473"></a><a href="#Footnote_2473" class="fnanchor">2473</a></p>

<p>“The things that must be done are specified below; for some
of them orders have gone already, one of these being, ‘Let
treasure accumulate.’ The things which must be done are these:&mdash;First,
the repair of the fort; again:&mdash;the provision of stores;
again:&mdash;the daily allowance and lodging<a name="FNanchor_2474" id="FNanchor_2474"></a><a href="#Footnote_2474" class="fnanchor">2474</a> of envoys going backwards

<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;360.</span>made of burnt-brick which Ūstād Ḥasan ‘Alī was constructing in
the citadel. Let this work be ordered after taking counsel with
Ūstād Sl. Muḥammad; if a design exist, drawn earlier by Ūstād</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_647" id="Page_647">[Pg 647]</a></span></p><p>Ḥasan ‘Alī, let Ūstād Sl. Muḥammad finish the building precisely
according to it; if not, let him do so, after making a gracious and

dam which is to hold up the But-khāk-water at its exit from the
Khẉurd-Kābul narrows; again:&mdash;the repair of the Ghaznī

for which a one-mill stream must be diverted<a name="FNanchor_2478" id="FNanchor_2478"></a><a href="#Footnote_2478" class="fnanchor">2478</a>; again:&mdash;I had
water brought from Tūtūm-dara to rising ground south-west of
Khwāja Basta, there made a reservoir and planted young trees.
The place got the name of Belvedere,<a name="FNanchor_2479" id="FNanchor_2479"></a><a href="#Footnote_2479" class="fnanchor">2479</a> because it faces the ford
and gives a first-rate view. The best of young trees must be
planted there, lawns arranged, and borders set with sweet-herbs
and with flowers of beautiful colour and scent; again:&mdash;Sayyid
Qāsim has been named to reinforce thee; again:&mdash;do not neglect
the condition of matchlockmen and of Ūstād Muḥammad Amīn
the armourer<a name="FNanchor_2480" id="FNanchor_2480"></a><a href="#Footnote_2480" class="fnanchor">2480</a>; again:&mdash;directly this letter arrives, thou must get
my elder sister (Khān-zāda Begīm) and my wives right out of
Kābul, and escort them to Nīl-āb. However averse they may still
be, they most certainly must start within a week of the arrival of<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;360b.</span>
this letter. For why? Both because the armies which have gone
from Hindūstān to escort them are suffering hardship in a cramped
place (<i>tār yīrdā</i>), and also because they<a name="FNanchor_2481" id="FNanchor_2481"></a><a href="#Footnote_2481" class="fnanchor">2481</a> are ruining the country.”</p>

<p>“Again:&mdash;I made it clear in a letter written to ‘Abdu’l-lāh
(<i>‘asas</i>), that there had been very great confusion in my mind
(<i>d&uacute;ghdugha</i>), to counterbalance being in the oasis (<i>wādī</i>) of

<p>A witticism of Banāī’s came back to my mind:&mdash;One day when

quatrain was made before last year, and in truth the longing and
craving for a wine-party has been infinite and endless for two
years past, so much so that sometimes the craving for wine
brought me to the verge of tears. Thank God! this year that

<p>(<i>March 4th</i>) On Friday (<i>23rd</i>), I dismounted at Sl. Jalālu’d-dīn’s

a portion of cooked meat and other viands.<a name="FNanchor_2510" id="FNanchor_2510"></a><a href="#Footnote_2510" class="fnanchor">2510</a> After the meal,

(<i>i.e.</i> Dugdugī). As Khwāja Yaḥyā’s grandson Khwāja Kalān

also Mullā Maḥmūd (<i>Farābī</i>?), bringing him from Mullā ‘Alī

the river, and on the other side, set wrestlers to wrestle. In
opposition to the rule of gripping the strongest first, Dost-i-yāsīn-khair<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;363b.</span>

<p class="indent">(<i>March 8th</i>?) On Tuesday (<i>27th</i>?) we marched on.</p>

verdant. I went over by boat to visit it, returning to the boat
during the 1st watch (6-9 a.m.). While I rode carelessly along
the ravine (<i>jar</i>) of the river, my horse got to where it was fissured
and had begun to give way. I leapt off at once and flung myself
on the bank; even the horse did not go down; probably, however,
if I had stayed on its back, it and I would have gone down
together.</p>

<p>On this same day, I swam the Gang-river (Ganges), counting
every stroke;<a name="FNanchor_2524" id="FNanchor_2524"></a><a href="#Footnote_2524" class="fnanchor">2524</a> I crossed with 33, then, without resting, swam

<p>We reached the meeting of the waters of Gang and Jūn at the
Evening Prayer, had the boat drawn to the Pīāg side, and got
to camp at 1 watch, 4 <i>garīs</i> (10.30 p.m.).</p>

<p>(<i>March 9th</i>) On Wednesday (<i>Jumāda II. 28th</i>) from the 1st

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_656" id="Page_656">[Pg 656]</a></span>for Bihār began along the bank of Jūn. After 5 <i>kurohs</i> (10m.)
done, halt was made at Lawāīn.<a name="FNanchor_2527" id="FNanchor_2527"></a><a href="#Footnote_2527" class="fnanchor">2527</a> I went by boat. The people

Ādampūr, into boats again and to bring them on by water from
Pīāg.</p>

<p>On this ground we set wrestlers to wrestle. Dost-i-yāsīn-khair
gripped the boatman Champion of Lāhor; the contest
was stubborn; it was with great difficulty that Dost gave the
throw. A head-to-foot was bestowed on each.</p>

<p>(<i>March 15th and 16th</i>) People said that ahead of us was
a swampy, muddy, evil river called Tūs.<a name="FNanchor_2529" id="FNanchor_2529"></a><a href="#Footnote_2529" class="fnanchor">2529</a> In order to examine

Ramzān 5th and Wednesday 6th</i>) on this ground. For the horses
and camels a ford was found higher up, but people said laden carts
could not get through it because of its uneven, stony bottom.
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;364.</span>They were just ordered to get them through.</p>

<p>(<i>March 17th</i>) On Thursday (<i>7th</i>) we marched on. I myself
went by boat down to where the Tūs meets the Gang (Ganges),

<p>(<i>March 23rd</i>) On Wednesday (<i>13th</i>) we marched from that
ground. I visited the fort of Chunār, and dismounted about
one <i>kuroh</i> beyond it.</p>

<p>During the days we were marching from Pīāg, painful boils
had come out on my body. While we were on this ground, an
Ottoman Turk (Rūmī) used a remedy which had been recently
discovered in Rūm. He boiled pepper in a pipkin; I held the
sores in the steam and, after steaming ceased, laved them with
the hot water. The treatment lasted 2 sidereal hours.</p>

<p>While we were on this ground, a person said he had seen
tiger and rhinoceros on an <i>ārāl</i><a name="FNanchor_2535" id="FNanchor_2535"></a><a href="#Footnote_2535" class="fnanchor">2535</a> by the side of the camp.</p>

on that <i>ārāl</i>, elephants also being brought. Neither tiger
nor rhino appeared; one wild buffalo came out at the end of
the line. A bitter wind rising and the whirling dust being
very troublesome, I went back to the boat and in it to the camp
which was 2 <i>kurohs</i> (4m.) above Banāras.</p>

<p>Before dawn next morning (Monday) I went on by boat.
When we came to where the Gūī-water (Gūmtī) which is the
water of Jūnpūr, meets the Gang-water (Ganges), I went a little
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;365.</span>way up it and back. Narrower<a name="FNanchor_2541" id="FNanchor_2541"></a><a href="#Footnote_2541" class="fnanchor">2541</a> though it is, it has no ford; the
army-folk crossed it (last year) by boat, by raft, or by swimming
their horses.</p>

<p>To look at our ground of a year ago,<a name="FNanchor_2542" id="FNanchor_2542"></a><a href="#Footnote_2542" class="fnanchor">2542</a> from which we had started
for Jūnpūr,<a name="FNanchor_2543" id="FNanchor_2543"></a><a href="#Footnote_2543" class="fnanchor">2543</a> I went to about a <i>kuroh</i> lower than the mouth of
the Jūnpūr-water (Gūmtī). A favourable wind getting up behind,
our larger boat was tied to a smaller Bengalī one which, spreading
its sail, made very quick going. Two <i>garīs</i> of day remained
(5.15 p.m.) when we had reached that ground (Sayyidpur?), we
went on without waiting there, and by the Bed-time Prayer had
got to camp, which was a <i>kuroh</i> above Madan-Benāres,<a name="FNanchor_2544" id="FNanchor_2544"></a><a href="#Footnote_2544" class="fnanchor">2544</a> long
before the boats following us. Mughūl Beg had been ordered to

to measure the river’s bank whenever I went by boat. The direct
road today was said to be 11 <i>kurohs</i> (22m.), the distance along
the river, 18 (36m.).</p>

<p>(<i>March 29th</i>) Next day (<i>Tuesday 19th</i>), we stayed on that
ground.</p>

<p>(<i>March 30th</i>) On Wednesday (<i>20th</i>), we dismounted a <i>kuroh</i>
(2m.) below Ghāzīpūr, I going by boat.</p>

came also a dutiful letter from ‘Abdu’l-‘azīz <i>Master-of-the-horse</i>,
which had been written in Lāhor on the 20th of the latter Jumāda
(<i>Feb. 29th</i>), the very day on which Qarācha’s Hindūstānī servant
whom we had started off from near Kālpī,<a name="FNanchor_2549" id="FNanchor_2549"></a><a href="#Footnote_2549" class="fnanchor">2549</a> reached Lāhor.
‘Abdu’l-‘azīz wrote that he had gone with the others assigned to
meet my family at Nīl-āb, had met them there on the 9th of the
latter Jumāda (<i>Feb. 18th</i>), had accompanied them to Chīn-āb
(Chan-āb), left them there, and come ahead to Lāhor where he
was writing his letter.</p>

<p>(<i>April 1st</i>) We moved on, I going by boat, on Friday (<i>Rajab
22nd</i>). I landed opposite Chausā to look at the ground of a year
ago<a name="FNanchor_2550" id="FNanchor_2550"></a><a href="#Footnote_2550" class="fnanchor">2550</a> where the Sun had been eclipsed and a fast kept.<a name="FNanchor_2551" id="FNanchor_2551"></a><a href="#Footnote_2551" class="fnanchor">2551</a> After
I got back to the boat, Muḥammad-i-zamān Mīrzā, coming up
behind by boat, overtook me; at his suggestion <i>ma‘jūn</i> was eaten.</p>

<p>The army had dismounted on the bank of the Karmā-nāśā-river,
about the water of which Hindūs are understood to be
extremely scrupulous. They do not cross it, but go past its
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_660" id="Page_660">[Pg 660]</a></span>mouth by boat along the Gang (Ganges). They firmly believe
that, if its water touch a person, the merit of his works is destroyed;
with this belief its name accords.<a name="FNanchor_2552" id="FNanchor_2552"></a><a href="#Footnote_2552" class="fnanchor">2552</a> I went some way up it by
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;366.</span>boat, turned back, went over to the north bank of Gang, and tied
up. There the braves made a little fun, some wrestling. Muḥsin
the cup-bearer challenged, saying, “I will grapple with four or
five.” The first he gripped, he threw; the second, who was
Shādmān (Joyous), threw him, to Muḥsin’s shame and vexation.
The (professional) wrestlers came also and set to.</p>

<p>(<i>April 2nd</i>) Next morning, Saturday (<i>23rd</i>) we moved, close
to the 1st watch (6 a.m.), in order to get people off to look at the
ford through the Karmā-nāśā-water. I rode up it for not less
than a <i>kuroh</i> (2 m.), but the ford being still far on,<a name="FNanchor_2553" id="FNanchor_2553"></a><a href="#Footnote_2553" class="fnanchor">2553</a> took boat and
went to the camp below Chausā.</p>

<p>Today I used the pepper remedy again; it must have been
somewhat hotter than before, for it blistered (<i>qāpārdī</i>) my body,
giving me much pain.</p>

<p>(<i>April 3rd</i>) We waited a day for a road to be managed across
a smallish, swampy rivulet heard to be ahead.<a name="FNanchor_2554" id="FNanchor_2554"></a><a href="#Footnote_2554" class="fnanchor">2554</a></p>

and sent off in answer to those brought by the Hindūstānī footman
of ‘Abdu’l-‘azīz.</p>

<p>The boat I got into at Monday’s dawn, had to be towed because
of the wind. On reaching the ground opposite Baksara (Buxar)
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;366b.</span>where the army had been seated many days last year,<a name="FNanchor_2556" id="FNanchor_2556"></a><a href="#Footnote_2556" class="fnanchor">2556</a> we went
over to look at it. Between 40 and 50 landing-steps had been
then made on the bank; of them the upper two only were left,
the river having destroyed the rest. <i>Ma‘jūn</i> was eaten after
return to the boat. We tied up at an <i>ārāl</i><a name="FNanchor_2557" id="FNanchor_2557"></a><a href="#Footnote_2557" class="fnanchor">2557</a> above the camp, set
the champions to wrestle, and went on at the Bed-time Prayer.
A year ago (<i>yīl-tūr</i>), an excursion had been made to look at the
ground on which the camp now was, I passing through Gang

<p>(<i>April 10th</i>) We moved on next day (<i>Sunday 2nd</i>), I going by
boat. From our today’s ground Muḥammad-i-zamān M. crossed
(his army) over the river (Son), leaving none behind. We spent
2 or 3 days on this ground in order to put his work through and
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;367b.</span>get him off.</p>

belt, a <i>tīpūchāq</i> horse and an umbrella.<a name="FNanchor_2564" id="FNanchor_2564"></a><a href="#Footnote_2564" class="fnanchor">2564</a> He also was made to
kneel (<i>yūkūndūrūldī</i>) for the Bihār country. Of the Bihār revenues
one <i>krūr</i> and 25 <i>laks</i> were reserved for the Royal Treasury; its
Dīwānī was entrusted to Murshid <i>‘Irāqī</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>April 14th</i>) I left that ground by boat on Thursday (<i>6th</i>).
I had already ordered the boats to wait, and on getting up with
them, I had them fastened together abreast in line.<a name="FNanchor_2565" id="FNanchor_2565"></a><a href="#Footnote_2565" class="fnanchor">2565</a> Though all
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_663" id="Page_663">[Pg 663]</a></span>were not collected there, those there were greatly exceeded the
breadth of the river. They could not move on, however, so-arranged,
because the water was here shallow, there deep, here
swift, there still. A crocodile (<i>gharīāl</i>) shewing itself, a terrified
fish leaped so high as to fall into a boat; it was caught and
brought to me.</p>

<p>When we were nearing our ground, we gave the boats names:&mdash;a<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;368.</span>

Another, which Arāīsh Khān had built and presented to me this
year before our army got to horse, one in which I had had a
platform set up on our way to this ground, was named Arāīsh
(Ornament). Another, a good-sized one presented to me by
Jalālu’d-dīn <i>Sharqī</i>, was named the Gunjāīsh (Capacious); in it
I had ordered a second platform set up, on the top of the one
already in it. To a little skiff, having a <i>chaukandī</i>,<a name="FNanchor_2569" id="FNanchor_2569"></a><a href="#Footnote_2569" class="fnanchor">2569</a> one used for

peace existed between us and the Bengalī (Naṣrat Shāh <i>Afghān</i>),

(<i>faṣl soz</i>), and decided to let the envoy go.</p>

<p>(<i>April 18th</i>) On Monday (<i>10th</i>) when the Bengal envoy came

follows was mentioned:<a name="FNanchor_2581" id="FNanchor_2581"></a><a href="#Footnote_2581" class="fnanchor">2581</a>&mdash;“We shall be going to this side and

his leave to go was given.</p>

<p>(<i>April 21st</i>) On Thursday (<i>13th</i>) Shaikh Jamālī was sent with

<p>(<i>April 24th</i>) On Sunday (<i>16th</i>) Mullā Maẕhab received his
usual keepsakes (<i>yādgārlār</i>) and was given leave to go.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;369b.</span>(<i>April 25th</i>) On Monday (<i>17th</i>) Khalīfa was sent, with several
begs, to see where the river (Ganges) could be crossed.</p>

<p>(<i>April 27th</i>) On Wednesday, (<i>19th</i>) Khalīfa again was sent
out, to look at the ground between the two rivers (Ganges and
Ghogrā).</p>

<p>On this same day I rode southward in the Ārī (Ārrah) <i>pargana</i>
to visit the sheets of lotus<a name="FNanchor_2586" id="FNanchor_2586"></a><a href="#Footnote_2586" class="fnanchor">2586</a> near Ārī. During the excursion
Shaikh Gūran brought me fresh-set lotus-seeds, first-rate little
things just like pistachios. The flower, that is to say, the <i>nīlūfar</i>
(lotus), Hindūstānīs call <i>kuwul-kikrī</i> (lotus-pistachio), and its
seed <i>dūdah</i> (soot).</p>

<p>As people said, “The Son is near,” we went to refresh ourselves
on it. Masses of trees could be seen down-stream; “Munīr is
there,” said they, “where the tomb is of Shaikh Yaḥyā the father
of Shaikh Sharafu’d-dīn <i>Munīrī</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_2587" id="FNanchor_2587"></a><a href="#Footnote_2587" class="fnanchor">2587</a> It being so close, I crossed
the Son, went 2 or 3 <i>kurohs</i> down it, traversed the Munīr orchards,
made the circuit of the tomb, returned to the Son-bank, made
ablution, went through the Mid-day Prayer before time, and
made for camp. Some of our horses, being fat,<a name="FNanchor_2588" id="FNanchor_2588"></a><a href="#Footnote_2588" class="fnanchor">2588</a> had fallen behind;
some were worn out; a few people were left to gather them
together, water them, rest them, and bring them on without
pressure; but for this many would have been ruined.</p>

<p>When we turned back from Munīr, I ordered that some-one
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;370.</span>should count a horse’s steps between the Son-bank and the camp.
They amounted to 23,100, which is 46,200 paces, which is 11-1/2
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_667" id="Page_667">[Pg 667]</a></span><i>kurohs</i> (23m.).<a name="FNanchor_2589" id="FNanchor_2589"></a><a href="#Footnote_2589" class="fnanchor">2589</a> It is about half a <i>kuroh</i> from Munīr to the Son;
the return journey from Munīr to the camp was therefore 12 <i>kurohs</i>
(24m.). In addition to this were some 15-16 <i>kurohs</i> done in
visiting this and that place; so that the whole excursion was one
of some 30 <i>kurohs</i> (60m.). Six <i>garīs</i> of the 1st night-watch had
passed [8.15 p.m.] when we reached the camp.</p>

<p>(<i>April 28th</i>) At the dawn of Thursday (<i>Sha‘bān 19th</i>) Sl.
Junaid <i>Barlās</i> came in with the Jūnpūr braves from Jūnpūr. I let

I did not see him. Qāẓī Jīā I sent for and saw.</p>

up, and that he should engage battle from this place;<a name="FNanchor_2594" id="FNanchor_2594"></a><a href="#Footnote_2594" class="fnanchor">2594</a> that
Muḥammad-i-zamān Mīrzā and the others inscribed for the work

Ūstād ‘Alī-qulī and Muṣt̤afa shelters (<i>muljār</i>) for the culverin-firers
should be raised by a mass of spadesmen and coolies (<i>kahār</i>)
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;370b.</span>under appointed overseers; that as soon as these shelters were
ready, ‘Askarī and the sult̤āns inscribed for the work should cross
quickly at the Haldī-passage<a name="FNanchor_2595" id="FNanchor_2595"></a><a href="#Footnote_2595" class="fnanchor">2595</a> and come down on the enemy;
that meantime, as Sl. Junaid and Qāẓī Jīā had given information
about a crossing-place<a name="FNanchor_2596" id="FNanchor_2596"></a><a href="#Footnote_2596" class="fnanchor">2596</a> 8 <i>kurohs</i> (16 m.) higher up,<a name="FNanchor_2597" id="FNanchor_2597"></a><a href="#Footnote_2597" class="fnanchor">2597</a> Zard-rūī(Pale-face?)
should go with a few raftsmen and some of the people of
the Sult̤ān, Maḥmūd Khān <i>Nūḥānī</i> and Qāẓī Jīā to look at that
crossing; and that, if crossing there were, they should go over
at once, because it was rumoured that the Bengalīs were planning
to post men at the Haldī-passage.</p>

<p>A dutiful letter from Maḥmūd Khān the Military-collector
(<i>shiqdār</i>) of Sikandarpūr now came, saying that he had collected
as many as 50 boats at the Haldī-passage and had given wages
to the boatmen, but that these were much alarmed at the rumoured
approach of the Bengalīs.</p>

<p>(<i>April 30th</i>) As time pressed<a name="FNanchor_2598" id="FNanchor_2598"></a><a href="#Footnote_2598" class="fnanchor">2598</a> for crossing the Sarū, I did not
wait for the return of those who had gone to look at the passage,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_669" id="Page_669">[Pg 669]</a></span>but on Saturday (<i>21st</i>) summoned the begs for consultation and
said, “As it has been reported that there are (no?) crossing-places
(fords?) along the whole of the ground from Chatur-mūk in Sikandarpūr
to Barāīch and Aūd,<a name="FNanchor_2599" id="FNanchor_2599"></a><a href="#Footnote_2599" class="fnanchor">2599</a> let us, while seated here, assign the

cross over and assault; let Muḥammad-i-zamān Mīrzā and those
appointed to act with him, engage battle from near Muṣt̤afa on
the other side of Gang.”</p>

<p>The matter having been left at this, the force for the north of
the Gang was formed into four divisions to start under ‘Askarī’s
command for the Haldī-passage. One division was of ‘Askarī
and his retainers; another was Sl. Jalālu’d-dīn <i>Sharqī</i>; another
was of the Aūzbeg sult̤āns Qāsim-i-ḥusain Sult̤ān, Bī-khūb Sult̤ān
and Tāng-aītmīsh Sult̤ān, together with Maḥmūd Khān <i>Nūḥānī</i>

of Mūsā Sl. (<i>Farmūlī</i>) and Sl. Junaid with what-not of the Jūnpūr
army, some 20,000 men. Officers were appointed to oversee the

(6a.m.). Zard-rūī and his party came in at mid-day; the ford

having met on the road the army getting near them.<a name="FNanchor_2602" id="FNanchor_2602"></a><a href="#Footnote_2602" class="fnanchor">2602</a></p>

<p>(<i>May 3rd</i>) On Tuesday (<i>Sha‘bān 24th</i>) we marched from
where the river had been crossed, went on for nearly one <i>kuroh</i>
(2 m.) and dismounted on the fighting-ground at the confluence.<a name="FNanchor_2603" id="FNanchor_2603"></a><a href="#Footnote_2603" class="fnanchor">2603</a>
I myself went to enjoy Ūstād ‘Alī-qulī’s firing of culverin and
<i>firingī</i>; he hit two boats today with <i>firingī</i>-stones, broke them
and sank them. Muṣt̤afa did the same from his side. I had
the large mortar<a name="FNanchor_2604" id="FNanchor_2604"></a><a href="#Footnote_2604" class="fnanchor">2604</a> taken to the fighting-ground, left Mullā Ghulām

<i>vasāwals</i><a name="FNanchor_2605" id="FNanchor_2605"></a><a href="#Footnote_2605" class="fnanchor">2605</a> and active braves to help him, went to an island facing

<p>Whilst still under the influence of the confection<a name="FNanchor_2606" id="FNanchor_2606"></a><a href="#Footnote_2606" class="fnanchor">2606</a> I had the
boat taken to near the tents and there slept. A strange thing
happened in the night, a noise and disturbance arising about the
3rd watch (midnight) and the pages and others snatching up
pieces of wood from the boat, and shouting “Strike! strike!”
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;372.</span>What was said to have led to the disturbance was that a night-guard
who was in the Farmāīsh along-side the Asāīsh in which
I was sleeping,<a name="FNanchor_2607" id="FNanchor_2607"></a><a href="#Footnote_2607" class="fnanchor">2607</a> opening his eyes from slumber, sees a man with

fall on him;<a name="FNanchor_2608" id="FNanchor_2608"></a><a href="#Footnote_2608" class="fnanchor">2608</a> he dives, comes up again, cuts at the night-guard’s

Once before, on the night we returned from Munīr, one or two

and had brought in two swords and a dagger of theirs. The Most

Aūghān-bīrdī and his men charged them, put them to flight, took
a few and cut their heads off, shot many with arrows, and got
possession of 7 or 8 boats. Today also Bengalīs crossed in a few
boats to Muḥammad-i-zamān Mīrzā’s side, there landed and<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;372b.</span>
provoked to fight. When attacked they fled, and three boat-loads
of them were drowned. One boat was captured and brought

<p>Today came a man from ‘Askarī to say that he had crossed
the [Sarū]-water, leaving none behind, and that he would come
down on the enemy at next day’s dawn, that is to say, on
Thursday’s. Here-upon those already ordered to cross over
were told to join ‘Askarī and to advance upon the enemy
with him.</p>

<p>At the Mid-day Prayer a person came from Ūstā, saying
“The stone is ready; what is the order?” The order was, “Fire
this stone off; keep the next till I come.” Going at the Other
Prayer in a very small Bengalī skiff to where shelter (<i>muljār</i>)
had been raised, I saw Ūstā fire off one large stone and several
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_672" id="Page_672">[Pg 672]</a></span>small <i>firingī</i> ones. Bengalīs have a reputation for fire-working;<a name="FNanchor_2613" id="FNanchor_2613"></a><a href="#Footnote_2613" class="fnanchor">2613</a>
we tested it now; they do not fire counting to hit a particular
spot, but fire at random.</p>

<p>At this same Other Prayer orders were given to draw a few
boats up-stream along the enemy’s front. A few were got past
without a “God forbid!”<a name="FNanchor_2614" id="FNanchor_2614"></a><a href="#Footnote_2614" class="fnanchor">2614</a> from those who, all unprotected, drew
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;373.</span>them up. Aīsān-tīmūr Sl. and Tūkhta-būghā Sl. were ordered
to stay at the place those boats reached, and to keep watch over
them. I got back to camp in the 1st night-watch of Thursday.<a name="FNanchor_2615" id="FNanchor_2615"></a><a href="#Footnote_2615" class="fnanchor">2615</a></p>

<p>Near midnight came news from (Aūghān-bīrdī’s) boats which
were being drawn up-stream, “The force appointed had gone
somewhat ahead; we were following, drawing the boats, when
the Bengalīs got to know where we were drawing them and
attacked. A stone hit a boatman in the leg and broke it, we
could not pass on.”</p>

<p>(<i>May 5th</i>) At dawn on Thursday (<i>Sha‘bān 26th</i>) came the
news from those at the shelter, “All the boats have come from
above.<a name="FNanchor_2616" id="FNanchor_2616"></a><a href="#Footnote_2616" class="fnanchor">2616</a> The enemy’s horse has ridden to meet our approaching

to above those boats<a name="FNanchor_2617" id="FNanchor_2617"></a><a href="#Footnote_2617" class="fnanchor">2617</a> that had been drawn up in the night.
A galloper was sent off with an order for Muḥammad Sl. M. and
those appointed to cross with him, to do it at once and join
‘Askarī. The order for Aīsān-tīmūr Sl. and Tūkhta-būghā Sl.
who were above these boats,<a name="FNanchor_2618" id="FNanchor_2618"></a><a href="#Footnote_2618" class="fnanchor">2618</a> was that they should busy themselves
to cross. Bābā Sl. was not at his post.<a name="FNanchor_2619" id="FNanchor_2619"></a><a href="#Footnote_2619" class="fnanchor">2619</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_673" id="Page_673">[Pg 673]</a></span></p>
<p>Aīsān-tīmūr Sl. at once crosses, in one boat with 30-40 of his
retainers who hold their horses by the mane at the boat-side.<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;373b.</span>
A second boat follows. The Bengalīs see them crossing and
start off a mass of foot-soldiers for them. To meet these go 7 or
8 of Aīsān-tīmūr Sl.’s retainers, keeping together, shooting off
arrows, drawing those foot-soldiers towards the Sult̤ān who meantime
is getting his men mounted; meantime also the second boat
is moving (<i>rawān</i>). When his 30-35 horsemen charge those
foot-soldiers, they put them well to flight. Aīsān-tīmūr did
distinguished work, first in crossing before the rest, swift, steady,
and without a “God forbid!”, secondly in his excellent advance,
with so few men, on such a mass of foot, and by putting these to
flight. Tūkhta-būghā Sl. also crossed. Then boats followed
one after another. Lāhorīs and Hindūstānīs began to cross
from their usual posts<a name="FNanchor_2620" id="FNanchor_2620"></a><a href="#Footnote_2620" class="fnanchor">2620</a> by swimming or on bundles of reeds.<a name="FNanchor_2621" id="FNanchor_2621"></a><a href="#Footnote_2621" class="fnanchor">2621</a>
Seeing how matters were going, the Bengalīs of the boats opposite
the shelter (Muṣt̤afa’s), set their faces for flight down-stream.</p>

<p>Darwīsh-i-muḥammad <i>Sārbān</i>, Dost Lord-of-the-gate, Nūr
Beg and several braves also went across the river. I made a man
gallop off to the Sult̤āns to say, “Gather well together those who<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;374.</span>
cross, go close to the opposing army, take it in the flank, and
get to grips.” Accordingly the Sult̤āns collected those who
crossed, formed up into 3 or 4 divisions, and started for the foe.
As they draw near, the enemy-commander, without breaking his
array, flings his foot-soldiers to the front and so comes on. Kūkī
comes up with a troop from ‘Askarī’s force and gets to grips on
his side; the Sult̤āns get to grips on theirs; they get the upper
hand, unhorse man after man, and make the enemy scurry off.
Kūkī’s men bring down a Pagan of repute named Basant Rāō
and cut off his head; 10 or 15 of his people fall on Kūkī’s, and
are instantly cut to pieces. Tūkhta-būghā Sl. gallops along the
enemy’s front and gets his sword well in. Mughūl ‘Abdu’l-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_674" id="Page_674">[Pg 674]</a></span>wahhāb
and his younger brother gets theirs in well too. Mughūl
though he did not know how to swim, had crossed the river
holding to his horse’s mane.</p>

<p>I sent for my own boats which were behind;<a name="FNanchor_2622" id="FNanchor_2622"></a><a href="#Footnote_2622" class="fnanchor">2622</a> the Farmāīsh
coming up first, I went over in it to visit the Bengalīs’ encamping-grounds.
I then went into the Gunjāīsh. “Is there a crossing-place
higher up?” I asked. Mīr Muḥammad the raftsman
represented that the Sarū was better to cross higher up;<a name="FNanchor_2623" id="FNanchor_2623"></a><a href="#Footnote_2623" class="fnanchor">2623</a>
accordingly the army-folk<a name="FNanchor_2624" id="FNanchor_2624"></a><a href="#Footnote_2624" class="fnanchor">2624</a> were ordered to cross at the higher
place he named.</p>

<p>While those led by Muḥammad Sl. Mīrzā were crossing the
<span class="sidenote">Fol.&nbsp;374b.</span>river,<a name="FNanchor_2625" id="FNanchor_2625"></a><a href="#Footnote_2625" class="fnanchor">2625</a> the boat in which Yakka Khwāja was, sank and he went
to God’s mercy. His retainers and lands were bestowed on his
younger brother Qāsim Khwāja.</p>

<p>The Sult̤āns arrived while I was making ablution for the Mid-day
Prayer; I praised and thanked them and led them to expect
guerdon and kindness. ‘Askarī also came; this was the first
affair he had seen; one well-omened for him!</p>

<p>As the camp had not yet crossed the river, I took my rest in
the boat Gunjāīsh, near an island.</p>

whatever any person knew of his father (Humāyūn) and grandfather
(Bābur) should be written down for Abū’l-faẓl’s use. It
embodies family memories and traditions, and presumably gives
the recollections of several ladies of the royal circle.<a name="FNanchor_2693" id="FNanchor_2693"></a><a href="#Footnote_2693" class="fnanchor">2693</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_692" id="Page_692">[Pg 692]</a></span></p>
<p>The <i>Akbar-nāma</i> derives much of its narrative for 936-937 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>
from Ḥaidar Mīrzā and Gul-badan Begīm, but its accounts of
Bābur’s self-surrender and of his dying address to his chiefs
presuppose the help of information from a contemporary witness.
It is noticeable that the <i>Akbar-nāma</i> records no public events
as occurring in Hindūstān during 936-937 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>, nothing of the
sequel of rebellion by Raḥīm-dād<a name="FNanchor_2694" id="FNanchor_2694"></a><a href="#Footnote_2694" class="fnanchor">2694</a> and ‘Abdu’l-‘azīz, nothing of
the untiring Bīban and Bāyazīd. That something could have
been told is shown by what Aḥmad-i-yādgār has preserved (<i>vide
post</i>); but 50 years had passed since Bābur’s death and, manifestly,
interest in filling the <i>lacunæ</i> in his diary was then less keen than it
is over 300 years later. What in the <i>Akbar-nāma</i> concerns Bābur
is likely to have been written somewhat early in the <i>cir.</i> 15
years of its author’s labours on it,<a name="FNanchor_2695" id="FNanchor_2695"></a><a href="#Footnote_2695" class="fnanchor">2695</a> but, even so, the elder women
of the royal circle had had rest after the miseries Humāyūn had
wrought, the forgiveness of family affection would veil his past,
and certainly has provided Abū’l-faẓl with an over-mellowed
estimate of him, one ill-assorting with what is justified by his
Bābur-nāma record.</p>

<p>The contribution made towards filling the gap of 936-937 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>
in the body of Niz̤āmu-’d-dīn Aḥmad’s <i>T̤abaqāt-i-akbarī</i> is
limited to a curious and doubtfully acceptable anecdote about
a plan for the supersession of Humāyūn as Pādshāh, and about
the part played by Khwāja Muqīm <i>Harāwī</i> in its abandonment.
A further contribution is made, however, in Book VII which
contains the history of the Muḥammadan Kings of Kashmīr,
namely, that Bābur despatched an expedition into that country.
As no such expedition is recorded or referred to in surviving
Bābur-nāma writings, it is likely to have been sent in 936 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>
during Bābur’s tour to and from Lāhor. If it were made with
the aim of extending Tīmūrid authority in the Himālayan
borderlands, a hint of similar policy elsewhere may be given
by the ceremonious visit of the Rāja of Kahlūr to Bābur,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_693" id="Page_693">[Pg 693]</a></span>mentioned by Aḥmad-i-yādgār (<i>vide post</i>).<a name="FNanchor_2696" id="FNanchor_2696"></a><a href="#Footnote_2696" class="fnanchor">2696</a> The T̤.-i-A. was
written within the term of Abū’l-faẓl’s work on the <i>Akbar-nāma</i>,
being begun later, and ended about 9 years earlier, in 1002 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1593
<span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span> It appears to have been Abū'-l-faẓl’s authority for his
account of the campaign carried on in Kashmīr by Bābur’s
chiefs (<i>Āyīn-i-akbarī</i> vol. ii, part i, Jarrett’s trs. p. 389).</p>

<p>An important contribution, seeming to be authentic, is found
interpolated in Aḥmad-i-yādgār’s <i>Tārīkh-i-salāt̤īn-i-afāghana</i>,
one which outlines a journey made by Bābur to Lāhor in 936 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>
and gives circumstantial details of a punitive expedition sent by
him from Sihrind at the complaint of the Qāẓī of Samāna against
a certain Mundāhir Rājpūt. The whole contribution dovetails
into matters found elsewhere. Its precision of detail bespeaks
a closely-contemporary written source.<a name="FNanchor_2697" id="FNanchor_2697"></a><a href="#Footnote_2697" class="fnanchor">2697</a> As its fullest passage
concerns the Samāna Qāẓī’s affair, its basis of record may have
been found in Samāna. Some considerations about the date of
Aḥmad-i-yādgār’s own book and what Niamatu’l-lāh says of
Haibat Khān of Samāna, his own generous helper in the <i>Tārīkhi-Khan-i-jahān
Lūdī</i>, point towards Haibat Khān as providing
the details of the Qāẓī’s wrongs and avenging. The indication
is strengthened by the circumstance that what precedes and what
follows the account of the punitive expedition is outlined only.<a name="FNanchor_2698" id="FNanchor_2698"></a><a href="#Footnote_2698" class="fnanchor">2698</a>
Aḥmad-i-yādgār interpolates an account of Humāyūn also, which
is a frank plagiarism from the <i>T̤abaqāt-i-akbarī</i>. He tells too
a story purporting to explain why Bābur “selected” Humāyūn to
succeed him, one parallel with Niz̤āmu’d-dīn Aḥmad’s about
what led Khalīfa to abandon his plan of setting the Mīrzā aside.
Its sole value lies in its testimony to a belief, held by its first
narrator whoever he was, that choice was exercised in the matter
by Bābur. Reasons for thinking Niz̤āmu’d-dīn’s story, as it
stands, highly improbable, will be found later in this note.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_694" id="Page_694">[Pg 694]</a></span></p>
<p>Muḥammad Qāsim Hindū Shāh <i>Firishta’s Tārīkh-i-firishta</i>
contains an interesting account of Bābur but contributes towards
filling the gap in the events of 936-937 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> little that is not in the
earlier sources. In M. Jules Mohl’s opinion it was under revision
as late as 1623 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span> (1032-3 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>).</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>a. Humāyūn and Badakhshān.</i>)</p>

<p>An occurrence which had important results, was the arrival
of Humāyūn in Āgra, unsummoned by his Father, from the
outpost station of Badakhshān. It will have occurred early in
936 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (autumn 1529 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>), because he was in Kābul in the first
ten days of the last month of 935 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (<i>vide post</i>). Curiously
enough his half-sister Gul-badan does not mention his coming,
whether through avoidance of the topic or from inadvertence; the
omission may be due however to the loss of a folio from the only
known MS. of her book (that now owned by the British Museum),
and this is the more likely that Abū’l-faẓl writes, at some length,
about the arrival and its motive, what the Begīm might have
provided, this especially by his attribution of filial affection as
Humāyūn’s reason for coming to Āgra.</p>

<p>Ḥaidar Mīrzā is the authority for the Akbar-nāma account of
Humāyūn’s departure from Qila‘-i-z̤afar and its political and
military sequel. He explains the departure by saying that when
Bābur had subdued Hindūstān, his sons Humāyūn and Kāmrān
were grown-up; and that wishing to have one of them at hand in
case of his own death, he summoned Humāyūn, leaving Kāmrān
in Qandahār. No doubt these were the contemporary impressions
conveyed to Ḥaidar, and strengthened by the accomplished fact
before he wrote some 12 years later; nevertheless there are two
clear indications that there was no royal order for Humāyūn to
leave Qila‘-i-z̤afar, <i>viz.</i> that no-one had been appointed to relieve
him even when he reached Āgra, and that Abū’l-faẓl mentions
no summons but attributes the Mīrzā’s departure from his post
to an overwhelming desire to see his Father. What appears
probable is that Māhīm wrote to her son urging his coming to
Āgra, and that this was represented as Bābur’s wish. However
little weight may be due to the rumour, preserved in anecdotes
recorded long after 935 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>, that any-one, Bābur or Khalīfa,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_695" id="Page_695">[Pg 695]</a></span>
inclined against Humāyūn’s succession, that rumour she would
set herself to falsify by reconciliation.<a name="FNanchor_2699" id="FNanchor_2699"></a><a href="#Footnote_2699" class="fnanchor">2699</a></p>

<p>When the Mīrzā’s intention to leave Qila‘-i-z̤afar became
known there, the chiefs represented that they should not be able
to withstand the Aūzbeg on their frontier without him (his troops
implied).<a name="FNanchor_2700" id="FNanchor_2700"></a><a href="#Footnote_2700" class="fnanchor">2700</a> With this he agreed, said that still he must go, and
that he would send a Mīrzā in his place as soon as possible. He
then rode, in one day, to Kābul, an item of rapid travel preserved
by Abū’l-faẓl.</p>

<p>Humāyūn’s departure caused such anxiety in Qila‘-i-z̤afar that
some (if not all) of the Badakhshī chiefs hurried off an invitation
to Sa‘īd Khān <i>Chaghatāī</i>, the then ruler in Kāshghar in whose
service Ḥaidar Mīrzā was, to come at once and occupy the fort.
They said that Faqīr-i-‘alī who had been left in charge, was not
strong enough to cope with the Aūzbeg, begged Sa‘īd to come,
and strengthened their petition by reminding him of his
hereditary right to Badakhshān, derived from Shāh Begīm
<i>Badakhshī</i>. Their urgency convincing the Khān that risk
threatened the country, he started from Kāshghar in Muḥarram
936 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (Sept-Oct. 1529 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>). On reaching Sārīgh-chūpān
which by the annexation of Abā-bakr Mīrzā <i>Dūghlāt</i> was now
his own most western territory<a name="FNanchor_2701" id="FNanchor_2701"></a><a href="#Footnote_2701" class="fnanchor">2701</a> but which formerly was one of
the upper districts of Badakhshān, he waited while Ḥaidar went
on towards Qila‘-i-z̤afar only to learn on his road, that Hind-āl
(<i>æt.</i> 10) had been sent from Kābul by Humāyūn and had
entered the fort 12 days before.</p>

<p>The Kāshgharīs were thus placed in the difficulty that the fort
was occupied by Bābur’s representative, and that the snows would
prevent their return home across the mountains till winter was
past. Winter-quarters were needed and asked for by Ḥaidar,
certain districts being specified in which to await the re-opening
of the Pāmīr routes. He failed in his request, “They did not
trust us,” he writes, “indeed suspected us of deceit.” His own
account of Sa‘īd’s earlier invasion of Badakhshān (925 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1519
<span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>) during Khān Mīrzā’s rule, serves to explain Badakhshī
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_696" id="Page_696">[Pg 696]</a></span>distrust of Kāshgharīs. Failing in his negotiations, he scoured
and pillaged the country round the fort, and when a few days
later the Khān arrived, his men took what Ḥaidar’s had left.</p>

<p>Sa‘īd Khān is recorded to have besieged the fort for three
months, but nothing serious seems to have been attempted since
no mention of fighting is made, none of assault or sally, and
towards the end of the winter he was waited on by those who
had invited his presence, with apology for not having admitted
him into the fort, which they said they would have done but for
the arrival of Hind-āl Mīrzā. To this the Khān replied that for
him to oppose Bābur Pādshāh was impossible; he reminded the
chiefs that he was there by request, that it would be as hurtful for
the Pādshāh as for himself to have the Aūzbeg in Badakhshān
and, finally, he gave it as his opinion that, as matters stood, every
man should go home. His view of the general duty may include
that of Badakhshī auxiliaries such as Sult̤ān Wais of Kūl-āb
who had reinforced the garrison. So saying, he himself set out
for Kāshghar, and at the beginning of Spring reached Yārkand.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>b. Humāyūn’s further action.</i></p>

<p>Humāyūn will have reached Kābul before Ẕū’l-ḥijja 10th
935 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (Aug. 26th 1529 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>) because it is on record that he met
Kāmrān on the Kābul ‘Īd-gāh, and both will have been there to
keep the ‘Īdu’l-kabīr, the Great Festival of Gifts, which is held on
that day. Kāmrān had come from Qandahār, whether to keep the
Feast, or because he had heard of Humāyūn’s intended movement
from Badakhshān, or because changes were foreseen and he
coveted Kābul, as the <i>Bābur-nāma</i> and later records allow to be
inferred. He asked Humāyūn, says Abū’l-faẓl, why he was there
and was told of his brother’s impending journey to Āgra under
overwhelming desire to see their Father.<a name="FNanchor_2702" id="FNanchor_2702"></a><a href="#Footnote_2702" class="fnanchor">2702</a> Presumably the two
Mīrzās discussed the position in which Badakhshān had been
left; in the end Hind-āl was sent to Qila‘-i-z̤afar, notwithstanding
that he was under orders for Hindūstān.</p>

<p>Humāyūn may have stayed some weeks in Kābul, how many
those familiar with the seasons and the routes between Yārkand
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_697" id="Page_697">[Pg 697]</a></span>and Qila‘-i-z̤afar, might be able to surmise if the date of Hind-āl’s
start northward for which Humāyūn is likely to have waited,
were found by dovetailing the Muḥarram of Sa‘īd’s start, the
approximate length of his journey to Sārīgh-chūpān, and Ḥaidar’s
reception of news that Hind-āl had been 12 days in the fort.</p>

<p>Humāyūn’s arrival in Āgra is said by Abū’l-faẓl to have been
cheering to the royal family in their sadness for the death of
Alwar (end of 935 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>) and to have given pleasure to his Father.
But the time is all too near the date of Bābur’s letter (f.348)
to Humāyūn, that of a dissatisfied parent, to allow the supposition
that his desertion of his post would fail to displease.</p>

<p>That it was a desertion and not an act of obedience seems
clear from the circumstance that the post had yet to be filled.
Khalīfa is said to have been asked to take it and to have
refused;<a name="FNanchor_2703" id="FNanchor_2703"></a><a href="#Footnote_2703" class="fnanchor">2703</a> Humāyūn to have been sounded as to return and to
have expressed unwillingness. Bābur then did what was an
honourable sequel to his acceptance in 926 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> of the charge of
the fatherless child Sulaimān, by sending him, now about 16, to
take charge where his father Khān Mīrzā had ruled, and by still
keeping him under his own protection.</p>

<p>Sulaimān’s start from Āgra will not have been delayed, and
(accepting Aḥmad-i-yādgār’s record,) Bābur himself will have
gone as far as Lāhor either with him or shortly after him, an
expedition supporting Sulaimān, and menacing Sa‘īd in his
winter leaguer round Qila‘-i-z̤afar. Meantime Humāyūn was
ordered to his fief of Saṃbhal.</p>

<p>After Sulaimān’s appointment Bābur wrote to Sa‘īd a letter
of which Ḥaidar gives the gist:&mdash;It expresses surprise at Sa‘īd’s
doings in Badakhshān, says that Hind-āl has been recalled and
Sulaimān sent, that if Sa‘īd regard hereditary right, he will
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_698" id="Page_698">[Pg 698]</a></span>leave “Sulaimān Shāh Mīrzā”<a name="FNanchor_2704" id="FNanchor_2704"></a><a href="#Footnote_2704" class="fnanchor">2704</a> in possession, who is as a son to
them both,<a name="FNanchor_2705" id="FNanchor_2705"></a><a href="#Footnote_2705" class="fnanchor">2705</a> that this would be well, that otherwise he (Bābur)
will make over responsibility to the heir (Sulaimān);<a name="FNanchor_2706" id="FNanchor_2706"></a><a href="#Footnote_2706" class="fnanchor">2706</a> and, “The
rest you know.”<a name="FNanchor_2707" id="FNanchor_2707"></a><a href="#Footnote_2707" class="fnanchor">2707</a></p>

<p class="indent"><i>c. Bābur visits Lāhor.</i></p>

<p>If Aḥmad-i-yādgār’s account of a journey made by Bābur to
Lāhor and the Panj-āb be accepted, the <i>lacuna</i> of 936 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> is
appropriately filled. He places the expedition in the 3rd year of
Bābur’s rule in Hindūstān, which, counting from the first reading
of the <i>khut̤ba</i> for Bābur in Dihlī (f. 286), began on Rajab 15th
935 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (March 26th 1529 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>). But as Bābur’s diary-record for
935 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> is complete down to end of the year, (minor <i>lacunæ</i>
excepted), the time of his leaving Āgra for Lāhor is relegated to
936 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> He must have left early in the year, (1) to allow time,
before the occurrence of the known events preceding his own
death, for the long expedition Aḥmad-i-yādgār calls one of
a year, and (2) because an early start after Humāyūn’s arrival
and Sulaimān’s departure would suit the position of affairs and
the dates mentioned or implied by Ḥaidar’s and by Aḥmad-i-yādgār’s
narratives.</p>

<p>Two reasons of policy are discernible, in the known events of
the time, to recommend a journey in force towards the North-west;
first, the sedition of ‘Abdu’l-‘azīz in Lāhor (f. 381), and secondly,
the invasion of Badakhshān by Sa‘īd Khān with its resulting
need of supporting Sulaimān by a menace of armed intervention.<a name="FNanchor_2708" id="FNanchor_2708"></a><a href="#Footnote_2708" class="fnanchor">2708</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_699" id="Page_699">[Pg 699]</a></span></p>
<p>In Sihrind the Rāja of Kahlūr, a place which may be one of the
Simla hill-states, waited on Bābur, made offering of 7 falcons and
3 <i>mans</i><a name="FNanchor_2709" id="FNanchor_2709"></a><a href="#Footnote_2709" class="fnanchor">2709</a> of gold, and was confirmed in his fief.<a name="FNanchor_2710" id="FNanchor_2710"></a><a href="#Footnote_2710" class="fnanchor">2710</a></p>

<p>In Lāhor Kāmrān is said to have received his Father, in
a garden of his own creation, and to have introduced the local
chiefs as though he were the Governor of Lāhor some writers
describe him as then being. The best sources, however, leave
him still posted in Qandahār. He had been appointed to
Multān (f. 359) when ‘Askarī was summoned to Āgra (f. 339),
but whether he actually went there is not assured; some months
later (Ẕū’l-ḥijja 10th 935 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>) he is described by Abū’l-faẓl as
coming to Kābul from Qandahār. He took both Multān<a name="FNanchor_2711" id="FNanchor_2711"></a><a href="#Footnote_2711" class="fnanchor">2711</a> and
Lāhor by force from his (half-)brother Humāyūn in 935 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>
(1531 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>) the year after their Father’s death. That he should
wait upon his Father in Lāhor would be natural, Hind-āl did so,
coming from Kābul. Hind-āl will have come to Lāhor after
making over charge of Qila‘-i-z̤afar to Sulaimān, and he went back
at the end of the cold season, going perhaps just before his Father
started from Lāhor on his return journey, the gifts he received
before leaving being 2 elephants, 4 horses, belts and jewelled
daggers.<a name="FNanchor_2712" id="FNanchor_2712"></a><a href="#Footnote_2712" class="fnanchor">2712</a></p>

<p>Bābur is said to have left Lāhor on Rajab 4th (936 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>)-(March
4th, 1530 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>). From Aḥmad-i-yādgār’s outline of Bābur’s
doings in Lāhor, he, or his original, must be taken as ill-informed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_700" id="Page_700">[Pg 700]</a></span>or indifferent about them. His interest becomes greater when he
writes of Samāna.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>d. Punishment of the Mundāhirs.</i></p>

<p>When Bābur, on his return journey, reached Sihrind, he
received a complaint from the Qāẓī of Samāna against one
Mohan <i>Mundāhir</i> (or <i>Mundhār</i>)<a name="FNanchor_2713" id="FNanchor_2713"></a><a href="#Footnote_2713" class="fnanchor">2713</a> <i>Rājpūt</i> who had attacked his
estates, burning and plundering, and killed his son. Here-upon
‘Alī-qulī of Hamadān<a name="FNanchor_2714" id="FNanchor_2714"></a><a href="#Footnote_2714" class="fnanchor">2714</a> was sent with 3000 horse to avenge the
Qāzī’s wrongs, and reached Mohan’s village, in the Kaithal
<i>pargana</i>, early in the morning when the cold was such that the
archers “could not pull their bows.”<a name="FNanchor_2715" id="FNanchor_2715"></a><a href="#Footnote_2715" class="fnanchor">2715</a> A marriage had been
celebrated over-night; the villagers, issuing from warm houses,
shot such flights of arrows that the royal troops could make no
stand; many were killed and nothing was effected; they retired
into the jungle, lit fires, warmed themselves(?), renewed the
attack and were again repulsed. On hearing of their failure,
Bābur sent off, perhaps again from Sihrind, Tarsam Bahādur
and Naurang Beg with 6000 horse and many elephants. This
force reached the village at night and when marriage festivities
were in progress. Towards morning it was formed into three
divisions,<a name="FNanchor_2716" id="FNanchor_2716"></a><a href="#Footnote_2716" class="fnanchor">2716</a> one of which was ordered to go to the west of the
village and show itself. This having been done, the villagers
advanced towards it, in the pride of their recent success. The
royal troops, as ordered beforehand, turned their backs and fled,
the Mundāhirs pursuing them some two miles. Meantime
Tarsam Bahādur had attacked and fired the village, killing many
of its inhabitants. The pursuers on the west saw the flames of
their burning homes, ran back and were intercepted on their way.
About 1000 men, women and children were made prisoner; there
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_701" id="Page_701">[Pg 701]</a></span>was also great slaughter, and a pillar of heads was raised. Mohan
was captured and later on was buried to the waist and shot to
death with arrows.<a name="FNanchor_2717" id="FNanchor_2717"></a><a href="#Footnote_2717" class="fnanchor">2717</a> News of the affair was sent to the Pādshāh.<a name="FNanchor_2718" id="FNanchor_2718"></a><a href="#Footnote_2718" class="fnanchor">2718</a></p>

<p>As after being in Sihrind, Bābur is said to have spent two
months hunting near Dihlī, it may be that he followed up the
punitive expedition sent into the Kaithal <i>pargana</i> of the Karnāl
District, by hunting in Nardak, a favourite ground of the
Tīmūrids, which lies in that district.</p>

<p>Thus the gap of 936 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> with also perhaps a month of 937 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>
is filled by the “year’s” travel west of Dihlī. The record is
a mere outline and in it are periods of months without mention
of where Bābur was or what affairs of government were brought
before him. At some time, on his return journey presumably,
he will have despatched to Kashmīr the expedition referred to in
the opening section of this appendix. Something further may
yet be gleaned from local chronicles, from unwritten tradition, or
from the witness of place-names commemorating his visit.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>e. Bābur’s self-surrender to save Humāyūn.</i></p>

<p>The few months, perhaps 4 to 5, between Bābur’s return to
Āgra from his expedition towards the North-west, and the time
of his death are filled by Gul-badan and Abū’l-faẓl with matters
concerning family interests only.</p>

<p>The first such matter these authors mention is an illness of
Humāyūn during which Bābur devoted his own life to save his
son’s.<a name="FNanchor_2719" id="FNanchor_2719"></a><a href="#Footnote_2719" class="fnanchor">2719</a> Of this the particulars are, briefly:&mdash;That Humāyūn,
while still in Saṃbhal, had had a violent attack of fever; that
he was brought by water to Āgra, his mother meeting him in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_702" id="Page_702">[Pg 702]</a></span>Muttra; and that when the disease baffled medical skill, Bābur
resolved to practise the rite believed then and now in the East to be
valid, of intercession and devotion of a suppliant’s most valued
possession in exchange for a sick man’s life. Rejecting counsel
to offer the Koh-i-nūr for pious uses, he resolved to supplicate for
the acceptance of his life. He made intercession through a saint
his daughter names, and moved thrice round Humāyūn’s bed,
praying, in effect, “O God! if a life may be exchanged for a life,
I, who am Bābur, give my life and my being for Humāyūn.”
During the rite fever surged over him, and, convinced that his
prayer and offering had prevailed, he cried out, “I have borne
it away! I have borne it away!”<a name="FNanchor_2720" id="FNanchor_2720"></a><a href="#Footnote_2720" class="fnanchor">2720</a> Gul-badan says that he
himself fell ill on that very day, while Humāyūn poured water
on his head, came out and gave audience; and that they carried
her Father within on account of his illness, where he kept his
bed for 2 or 3 months.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt as to Bābur’s faith in the rite he had
practised, or as to his belief that his offering of life was accepted;
moreover actual facts would sustain his faith and belief. Onlookers
also must have believed his prayer and offering to have
prevailed, since Humāyūn went back to Saṃbhal,<a name="FNanchor_2721" id="FNanchor_2721"></a><a href="#Footnote_2721" class="fnanchor">2721</a> while Bābur
fell ill at once and died in a few weeks.<a name="FNanchor_2722" id="FNanchor_2722"></a><a href="#Footnote_2722" class="fnanchor">2722</a></p>

<p class="indent"><i>f. A plan to set Bābur’s sons aside from the succession.</i></p>

<p>Reading the <i>Akbar-nāma</i> alone, there would seem to be no
question about whether Bābur ever intended to give Hindūstān,
at any rate, to Humāyūn, but, by piecing together various contributory
matters, an opposite opinion is reached, <i>viz.</i> that not
Khalīfa only whom Abū’l-faẓl names perhaps on Niz̤āmu’d-dīn
Aḥmad’s warrant, but Bābur also, with some considerable number
of chiefs, wished another ruler for Hindūstān. The starting-point
of this opinion is a story in the <i>T̤abaqāt-i-akbarī</i> and,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_703" id="Page_703">[Pg 703]</a></span>with less detail, in the <i>Akbar-nāma</i>, of which the gist is that
Khalīfa planned to supersede Humāyūn and his three brothers
in their Father’s succession.<a name="FNanchor_2723" id="FNanchor_2723"></a><a href="#Footnote_2723" class="fnanchor">2723</a></p>

<p class="caption">BĀBUR IN PRAYER, DEVOTING HIMSELF FOR HIS SON.</p>
<p class="right f09"><i>To face p.</i> 702.</p>
</div>

<p>The story, in brief, is as follows:&mdash;At the time of Bābur’s
death Niz̤āmu’d-dīn Aḥmad’s father Khwāja Muḥammad Muqīm
<i>Harāwī</i> was in the service of the Office of Works.<a name="FNanchor_2724" id="FNanchor_2724"></a><a href="#Footnote_2724" class="fnanchor">2724</a> Amīr
Niz̤āmu’d-dīn ‘Alī Khalīfa, the Chief of the Administration, had
dread and suspicion about Humāyūn and did not favour his
succession as Pādshāh. Nor did he favour that of Bābur’s other
sons. He promised “Bābur Pādshāh’s son-in-law (<i>dāmād</i>)”
Mahdī Khwāja who was a generous young man, very friendly to
himself, that he would make him Pādshāh. This promise becoming
known, others made their <i>salām</i> to the Khwāja who put on airs
and accepted the position. One day when Khalīfa, accompanied
by Muqīm, went to see Mahdī Khwāja in his tent, no-one else
being present, Bābur, in the pangs of his disease, sent for him<a name="FNanchor_2725" id="FNanchor_2725"></a><a href="#Footnote_2725" class="fnanchor">2725</a>
when he had been seated a few minutes only. When Khalīfa had
gone out, Mahdī Khwāja remained standing in such a way that
Muqīm could not follow but, the Khwāja unaware, waited
respectfully behind him. The Khwāja, who was noted for the
wildness of youth, said, stroking his beard, “Please God! first,
I will flay thee!” turned round and saw Muqīm, took him by
the ear, repeated a proverb of menace, “The red tongue gives
the green head to the wind,” and let him go. Muqīm hurried
to Khalīfa, repeated the Khwāja’s threat against him, and
remonstrated about the plan to set all Bābur’s sons aside in favour
of a stranger-house.<a name="FNanchor_2726" id="FNanchor_2726"></a><a href="#Footnote_2726" class="fnanchor">2726</a> Here-upon Khalīfa sent for Humāyūn,<a name="FNanchor_2727" id="FNanchor_2727"></a><a href="#Footnote_2727" class="fnanchor">2727</a>
and despatched an officer with orders to the Khwāja to retire to
his house, who found him about to dine and hurried him off
without ceremony. Khalīfa also issued a proclamation forbidding
intercourse with him, excluded him from Court, and
when Bābur died, supported Humāyūn.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_704" id="Page_704">[Pg 704]</a></span></p>
<p>As Niz̤āmu’d-dīn Aḥmad was not born till 20 years after
Bābur died, the story will have been old before he could
appreciate it, and it was some 60 years old when it found way
into the <i>T̤abaqāt-i-akbarī</i> and, with less detail, into the <i>Akbar-nāma</i>.</p>

<p>Taken as it stands, it is incredible, because it represents
Khalīfa, and him alone, planning to subject the four sons of Bābur
to the suzerainty of Mahdī Khwāja who was not a Tīmūrid,
who, so far as well-known sources show, was not of a ruling
dynasty or personally illustrious,<a name="FNanchor_2728" id="FNanchor_2728"></a><a href="#Footnote_2728" class="fnanchor">2728</a> and who had been associated,
so lately as the autumn of 1529 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>, with his nephew Raḥīm-dād
in seditious action which had so angered Bābur that, whatever
the punishment actually ordered, rumour had it both men were to
die.<a name="FNanchor_2729" id="FNanchor_2729"></a><a href="#Footnote_2729" class="fnanchor">2729</a> In two particulars the only Mahdī Khwāja then of Bābur’s
following, does not suit the story; he was not a young man in
1530 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>,<a name="FNanchor_2730" id="FNanchor_2730"></a><a href="#Footnote_2730" class="fnanchor">2730</a> and was not a <i>dāmād</i> of Bābur, if that word be taken
in its usual sense of son-in-law, but he was a <i>yazna</i>, husband of
a Pādshāh’s sister, in his case, of Khān-zāda Begīm.<a name="FNanchor_2731" id="FNanchor_2731"></a><a href="#Footnote_2731" class="fnanchor">2731</a> Some
writers style him Sayyid Mahdī Khwāja, a double title which
may indicate descent on both sides from religious houses; one
is suggested to be that of Tirmiẕ by the circumstance that in his
and Khān-zāda Begīm’s mausoleum was buried a Tirmiẕ sayyid
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_705" id="Page_705">[Pg 705]</a></span>of later date, Shāh Abū’l-ma‘ālī. But though he were of Tirmiẕ, it
is doubtful if that religious house would be described by the word
<i>khānwāda</i> which so frequently denotes a ruling dynasty.</p>

<p>His name may have found its way into Niz̤āmu’d-dīn Aḥmad’s
story as a gloss mistakenly amplifying the word <i>dāmād</i>, taken in
its less usual sense of brother-in-law. To Bābur’s contemporaries
the expression “Bābur Pādshāh’s <i>dāmād</i>” (son-in-law) would be
explicit, because for some 11 years before he lay on his death-bed,
he had one son-in-law only, <i>viz.</i> Muḥammad-i-zamān Mīrzā
<i>Bāī-qarā</i>,<a name="FNanchor_2732" id="FNanchor_2732"></a><a href="#Footnote_2732" class="fnanchor">2732</a> the husband of Ma‘ṣūma Sult̤ān Begīm. If that Mīrzā’s
name were where Mahdī Khwāja’s is entered, the story of an
exclusion of Bābur’s sons from rule might have a core of truth.</p>

<p>It is incredible however that Khālīfa, with or without Bābur’s
concurrence, made the plan attributed to him of placing any
man not a Tīmūrid in the position of Pādshāh over all Bābur’s
territory. I suggest that the plan concerned Hindūstān only
and was one considered in connection with Bābur’s intended
return to Kābul, when he must have left that difficult country,
hardly yet a possession, in charge of some man giving promise
of power to hold it. Such a man Humāyūn was not. My
suggestion rests on the following considerations:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) Bābur’s outlook was not that of those in Āgra in 1587 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>
who gave Abū’l-faẓl his Bāburiana material, because at that date
Dihlī had become the pivot of Tīmūrid power, so that not to
hold Hindūstān would imply not to be Pādshāh. Bābur’s outlook
on his smaller Hindūstān was different; his position in it was
precarious, Kābul, not Dihlī, was his chosen centre, and from
Kābul his eyes looked northwards as well as to the East. If he
had lost the Hindūstān which was approximately the modern
United Provinces, he might still have held what lay west of it
to the Indus, as well as Qandahār.</p>

<p>(2) For several years before his death he had wished to return
to Kābul. Ample evidence of this wish is given by his diary, his
letters, and some poems in his second <i>Dīwān</i> (that found in the
Rāmpūr MS.). As he told his sons more than once, he kept Kābul
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_706" id="Page_706">[Pg 706]</a></span>for himself.<a name="FNanchor_2733" id="FNanchor_2733"></a><a href="#Footnote_2733" class="fnanchor">2733</a> If, instead of dying in Āgra, he had returned to
Kābul, had pushed his way on from Badakhshān, whether as far
as Samarkand or less, had given Humāyūn a seat in those parts,&mdash;action
foreshadowed by the records&mdash;a reasonable interpretation
of the story that Humāyūn and his brothers were not
to govern Hindūstān, is that he had considered with Khalīfa the
apportionment of his territories according to the example of his
ancestors Chīngīz Khān, Tīmūr and Abū-sa‘īd; that by his plan of
apportionment Humāyūn was not to have Hindūstān but something
Tramontane; Kāmrān had already Qandahār; Sulaimān,
if Humāyūn had moved beyond the out-post of Badakhshān,
would have replaced him there; and Hindūstān would have gone
to “Bābur Pādshāh’s <i>dāmād</i>”.</p>

<p>(3) Muḥammad-i-zamān had much to recommend him for
Hindūstān:&mdash;Tīmūrid-born, grandson and heir of Sl. Ḥusain
Mīrzā, husband of Ma‘ṣūma who was a Tīmūrid by double
descent,<a name="FNanchor_2734" id="FNanchor_2734"></a><a href="#Footnote_2734" class="fnanchor">2734</a> protected by Bābur after the Bāī-qarā <i>débacle</i> in Herāt,
a landless man leading such other exiles as Muḥammad Sult̤ān
Mīrzā,<a name="FNanchor_2735" id="FNanchor_2735"></a><a href="#Footnote_2735" class="fnanchor">2735</a> ‘Ādil Sult̤ān, and Qāsim-i-ḥusain Sult̤ān, half-Tīmūrids
all, who with their Khurāsānī following, had been Bābur’s guests
in Kābul, had pressed on its poor resources, and thus had helped
in 932 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (1525 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>) to drive him across the Indus. This Bāī-qarā
group needed a location; Muḥammad-i-zamān’s future had
to be cared for and with his, Ma‘ṣūma’s.</p>

<p>(4) It is significant of intention to give Muḥammad-i-zamān
ruling status that in April 1529 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span> (Sha‘bān 935 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>) Bābur
bestowed on him royal insignia, including the umbrella-symbol
of sovereignty.<a name="FNanchor_2736" id="FNanchor_2736"></a><a href="#Footnote_2736" class="fnanchor">2736</a> This was done after the Mīrzā had raised
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_707" id="Page_707">[Pg 707]</a></span>objections, unspecified now in the <i>Bābur-nāma</i> against Bihār; they
were overcome, the insignia were given and, though for military
reasons he was withheld from taking up that appointment, the
recognition of his royal rank had been made. His next appointment
was to Jūnpūr, the capital of the fallen Sharqī dynasty.
No other chief is mentioned by Bābur as receiving the insignia
of royalty.</p>

<p>(5) It appears to have been within a Pādshāh’s competence to
select his successor; and it may be inferred that choice was
made between Humāyūn and another from the wording of more
than one writer that Khalīfa “supported” Humāyūn, and from
the word “selected” used in Aḥmad-i-yādgār’s anecdote.<a name="FNanchor_2737" id="FNanchor_2737"></a><a href="#Footnote_2737" class="fnanchor">2737</a> Much
more would there be freedom of choice in a division of territory
such as there is a good deal to suggest was the basis of Niz̤āmu’d-dīn
Aḥmad’s story. Whatever the extent of power proposed for
the <i>dāmād</i>, whether, as it is difficult to believe, the Pādshāh’s
whole supremacy, or whether the limited sovereignty of Hindūstān,
it must have been known to Bābur as well as to Khalīfa.
Whatever their earlier plan however, it was changed by the
sequel of Humāyūn’s illness which led to his becoming Pādshāh.
The <i>dāmād</i> was dropped, on grounds it is safe to believe more
impressive than his threat to flay Khalīfa or than the remonstrance
of that high official’s subordinate Muqīm of Herāt.</p>

<p>Humāyūn’s arrival and continued stay in Hindūstān modified
earlier dispositions which included his remaining in Badakhshān.
His actions may explain why Bābur, when in 936 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> he went
as far as Lāhor, did not go on to Kābul. Nothing in the sources
excludes the surmise that Māhīm knew of the bestowal of royal
insignia on the Bāī-qarā Mīrzā, that she summoned her son to
Āgra and there kept him, that she would do this the more
resolutely if the <i>dāmād</i> of the plan she must have heard of, were
that Bāī-qarā, and that but for Humāyūn’s presence in Āgra and
its attendant difficulties, Bābur would have gone to Kābul, leaving
his <i>dāmād</i> in charge of Hindūstān.</p>

<p>Bābur, however, turned back from Lāhor for Āgra, and there
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_708" id="Page_708">[Pg 708]</a></span>
he made the self-surrender which, resulting in Humāyūn’s
“selection” as Pādshāh, became a turning point in history.</p>

<p>Humāyūn’s recovery and Bābur’s immediate illness will have
made the son’s life seem Divinely preserved, the father’s as a debt
to be paid. Bābur’s impressive personal experience will have
dignified Humāyūn as one whom God willed should live. Such
distinction would dictate the bestowal on him of all that fatherly
generosity had yet to give. The imminence of death defeating
all plans made for life, Humāyūn was nominated to supreme
power as Pādshāh.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>g. Bābur’s death.</i></p>

<p>Amongst other family matters mentioned by Gul-badan as
occurring shortly before her Father’s death, was his arrangement
of marriages for Gul-rang with Aīsān-tīmūr and for Gul-chihra
with Tūkhta-būghā <i>Chaghatāī</i>. She also writes of his anxiety
to see Hind-āl who had been sent for from Kābul but did not
arrive till the day after the death.</p>

<p>When no remedies availed, Humāyūn was summoned from
Saṃbhal. He reached Āgra four days before the death; on the
morrow Bābur gathered his chiefs together for the last of many
times, addressed them, nominated Humāyūn his successor and
bespoke their allegiance for him. Abū’l-faẓl thus summarizes his
words, “Lofty counsels and weighty mandates were imparted.
Advice was given (to Humāyūn) to be munificent and just, to
acquire God’s favour, to cherish and protect subjects, to accept
apologies from such as had failed in duty, and to pardon transgressors.
And, he (Bābur) exclaimed, the cream of my testamentary
dispositions is this, ‘Do naught against your brothers,
even though they may deserve it.’ In truth,” continues the
historian, “it was through obedience to this mandate that his
Majesty Jannat-ashiyānī suffered so many injuries from his
brothers without avenging himself.” Gul-badan’s account of her
Father’s last address is simple:&mdash;“He spoke in this wise, ‘For
years it has been in my heart to make over the throne to
Humāyūn and to retire to the Gold-scattering Garden. By the
Divine grace I have obtained in health of body everything but
the fulfilment of this wish. Now that illness has laid me low,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_709" id="Page_709">[Pg 709]</a></span>
I charge you all to acknowledge Humāyūn in my stead. Fail
not in loyalty towards him. Be of one heart and mind towards
him. I hope to God that he, for his part, will bear himself well
towards men. Moreover, Humāyūn, I commit you and your
brothers and all my kinsfolk and your people and my people
to God’s keeping, and entrust them all to you.’”</p>

<p>It was on Monday Jumāda 1. 5th 937 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (Dec. 26th 153O <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>)
that Bābur made answer to his summons with the <i>Adsum</i> of the
Musalmān, “Lord! I am here for Thee.”</p>

<p>“Black fell the day for children and kinsfolk and all,” writes
his daughter;</p>

<p>mourns Khwāja Kalān in the funeral ode from which Badāyūnī
quoted these lines.<a name="FNanchor_2738" id="FNanchor_2738"></a><a href="#Footnote_2738" class="fnanchor">2738</a></p>

<p>The body was laid in the Garden-of-rest (<i>Ārām-bāgh</i>) which
is opposite to where the Tāj-i-maḥāll now stands. Khwāja
Muḥammad ‘Alī <i>‘asas</i><a name="FNanchor_2739" id="FNanchor_2739"></a><a href="#Footnote_2739" class="fnanchor">2739</a> was made the guardian of the tomb,
and many well-voiced readers and reciters were appointed to
conduct the five daily Prayers and to offer supplication for the
soul of the dead. The revenues of Sīkrī and 5 <i>laks</i> from Bīāna
were set aside for the endowment of the tomb, and Māhīm
Begīm, during the two and a half years of her remaining life,
sent twice daily from her own estate, an allowance of food
towards the support of its attendants.</p>

<p>In accordance with the directions of his will, Bābur’s body was
to be conveyed to Kābul and there to be laid in the garden of his
choice, in a grave open to the sky, with no building over it, no
need of a door-keeper.</p>

<p>Precisely when it was removed from Āgra we have not found
stated. It is known from Gul-badan that Kāmrān visited his
Father’s tomb in Āgra in 1539 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span> (946 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>) after the battle of
Chausa; and it is known from Jauhar that the body had been
brought to Kābul before 1544 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span> (952 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>), at which date
Humāyūn, in Kābul, spoke with displeasure of Kāmrān’s incivility
to “Bega Begīm”, the “Bībī” who had conveyed their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_710" id="Page_710">[Pg 710]</a></span>Father’s body to that place.<a name="FNanchor_2740" id="FNanchor_2740"></a><a href="#Footnote_2740" class="fnanchor">2740</a> That the widow who performed
this duty was the Afghān Lady, Bībī Mubārika<a name="FNanchor_2741" id="FNanchor_2741"></a><a href="#Footnote_2741" class="fnanchor">2741</a> is made
probable by Gul-badan’s details of the movements of the royal
ladies. Bābur’s family left Āgra under Hind-āl’s escort, after the
defeat at Chausa (June 7th, 1539 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>); whoever took charge of
the body on its journey to Kābul must have returned at some
later date to fetch it. It would be in harmony with Sher Shāh’s
generous character if he safe-guarded her in her task.</p>

<p>The terraced garden Bābur chose for his burial-place lies on
the slope of the hill Shāh-i-Kābul, the Sher-darwāza of European
writers.<a name="FNanchor_2742" id="FNanchor_2742"></a><a href="#Footnote_2742" class="fnanchor">2742</a> It has been described as perhaps the most beautiful
of the Kābul gardens, and as looking towards an unsurpassable
view over the Chār-dih plain towards the snows of Paghmān
and the barren, rocky hills which have been the hunting-grounds
of rulers in Kābul. Several of Bābur’s descendants coming to
Kābul from Āgra have visited and embellished his burial-garden.
Shāh-i-jahān built the beautiful mosque which stands near the
grave; Jahāngīr seems to have been, if not the author, at least
the prompter of the well-cut inscription adorning the upright
slab of white marble of Māīdān, which now stands at the grave-head.
The tomb-stone itself is a low grave-covering, not less
simple than those of relations and kin whose remains have been
placed near Bābur’s. In the thirties of the last century [the
later Sir] Alexander Burnes visited and admirably described
the garden and the tomb. With him was Munshī Mohan Lāl who
added to his own account of the beauties of the spot, copies of
the inscriptions on the monumental slab and on the portal of the
Mosque.<a name="FNanchor_2743" id="FNanchor_2743"></a><a href="#Footnote_2743" class="fnanchor">2743</a> As is shown by the descriptions these two visitors
give, and by Daniel’s drawings of the garden and the tomb,
there were in their time two upright slabs, one behind the other,
near the head of the grave. Mr. H. H. Hayden who visited the
garden in the first decade of the present century, shows in his
photograph of the grave, one upright stone only, the place of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_711" id="Page_711">[Pg 711]</a></span>one of the former two having been taken by a white-washed
lamp holder (<i>chirāghdān</i>).</p>

<p>The purport of the verses inscribed on the standing-slab is
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A ruler from whose brow shone the Light of God was that<a name="FNanchor_2744" id="FNanchor_2744"></a><a href="#Footnote_2744" class="fnanchor">2744</a>

one month], left Bābur before 909 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (1503 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>).</p>

<p>2. Zainab Sl. Begīm, daughter of Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā <i>Mīrān-shāhī</i>,
was married in 910 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (1504-5 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>), died childless two or
three years later.</p>

<p>3. Māhīm Begīm, whose parentage is not found stated, was
married in 912 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (1506 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>), bore Bār-būd, Mihr-jān, Āīsān-daulat,
Farūq [who all died in infancy], and Humāyūn.</p>

<p>4. Ma‘ṣūma Sl. Begīm, daughter of Sl. Aḥmad Mīrzā <i>Mīrān-shāhī</i>,
was married in 913 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (1507 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>), bore Ma‘ṣūma and died
at her birth, presumably early in the <i>lacuna</i> of 914-925 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>
(1508-19 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>).</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_712" id="Page_712">[Pg 712]</a></span></p>
<p>5. Gul-rukh Begīm, whose parentage is not found stated, was
perhaps a Begchīk Mughūl, was married between 914 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> and
925 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (1508-19 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>), probably early in the period, bore Shāh-rukh,
Aḥmad [who both died young], Gul‘iẕār [who also may
have died young], Kamrān and ‘Askarī.</p>

<p>6. Dil-dār Begīm, whose parentage is not found stated, was
married in the same period as Gul-rukh, bore Gul-rang, Gul-chihra,
Hind-āl, Gul-badan and Alwar, [who died in childhood].</p>

<p>7. The Afghān Lady (Afghānī Āghācha), Bībī Mubārika <i>Yūsufzāī</i>,
was married in 925 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (1519 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>), and died childless.</p>

<p>The two Circassian slaves Gul-nār Āghācha and Nār-gul
Āghācha of whom T̤ahmāsp made gift to Bābur in 933 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>
(f. 305), became recognized ladies of the royal household. They
are mentioned several times by Gul-badan as taking part in
festivities and in family conferences under Humāyūn. Gul-nār
is said by Abū’l-faẓl to have been one of Gul-badan’s pilgrim
band in 983 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (1575 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>).</p>

<p>The above list contains the names of three wives whose
parentage is not given or is vaguely given by the well-known
sources,&mdash;namely, Māhīm, Gul-rukh and Dil-dār. What would
sufficiently explain the absence of mention by Bābur of the
parentage of Gul-rukh and Dil-dār is that his record of the years
within which the two Begīms were married is not now with the
<i>Bābur-nāma</i>. Presumably it has been lost, whether in diary or
narrative form, in the <i>lacuna</i> of 914-25 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (1508-19 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>). Gul-rukh
appears to have belonged to the family of Begchīk Mughūls
described by Ḥaidar Mīrzā<a name="FNanchor_2747" id="FNanchor_2747"></a><a href="#Footnote_2747" class="fnanchor">2747</a>; her brothers are styled Mīrzā; she
was of good but not royal birth. Dil-dār’s case is less simple.
Nothing in her daughter Gul-badan’s book suggests that she and
her children were other than of the highest rank; numerous
details and shades of expression show their ease of equality with
royal personages. It is consistent with Gul-badan’s method of
enumerating her father’s wives that she should not state her own
mother’s descent; she states it of none of her “mothers”. There
is this interest in trying to trace Dil-dār’s parentage, that she
may have been the third daughter of Sl. Maḥmūd Mīrzā and
Pasha Begīm, and a daughter of hers may have been the mother of</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_713" id="Page_713">[Pg 713]</a></span></p>
<p>Salīma Sult̤ān Begīm who was given in marriage by Humāyūn
to Bairām Khān, later was married by Akbar, and was a woman
of charm and literary accomplishments. Later historians, Abū’l-faẓl
amongst their number, say that Salīma’s mother was a
daughter of Bābur’s wife Sālḥa Sult̤ān Begīm, and vary that
daughter’s name as Gul-rang-rukh-barg or -‘iẕār (the last form
being an equivalent of <i>chihra</i>, face). As there cannot have been
a wife with her daughter growing up in Bābur’s household, who
does not appear in some way in Gul-badan’s chronicle, and as
Salīma’s descent from Bābur need not be questioned, the knot is
most readily loosened by surmising that “Sālḥa” is the real name
of Gul-badan’s “Dildār”. Instances of double names are frequent,
<i>e.g.</i> Māhīm, Māh-chīchām, Qarā-gūz, Āq, (My Moon, My Moon
sister, Black-eyed, Fair). “Heart-holding” (Dil-dār) sounds like
a home-name of affection. It is the <i>Ma‘āsir-ī-raḥīmī</i> which gives
Sālḥa as the name of Bābur’s wife, Pasha’s third daughter. Its
author may be wrong, writing so late as he did (1025 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1616 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>),
or may have been unaware that Sālḥa was (if she were) known as
Dil-dār. It would not war against seeming facts to take Pasha’s
third daughter to be Bābur’s wife Dil-dār, and Dil-dār’s daughter
Gul-chihra to be Salīma’s mother. Gul-chihra was born in about
1516 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>, married to Tūkhta-būghā in 1530 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>, widowed in cir.
1533 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>, might have remarried with Nūru’d-dīn <i>Chaqānīānī</i>
(Sayyid Amīr), and in 945 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> might have borne him Salīma; she
was married in 1547 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span> (954 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>) to ‘Abbās Sult̤ān <i>Aūzbeg</i>.<a name="FNanchor_2748" id="FNanchor_2748"></a><a href="#Footnote_2748" class="fnanchor">2748</a>
Two matters, neither having much weight, make against taking
Dil-dār to be a <i>Mīrān-shāhī</i>; the first being that the anonymous
annotator who added to the archetype of Kehr’s Codex what is
entered in Appendix L.&mdash;<i>On Māhīm’s adoption of Hind-āl</i>, styles
her Dil-dār Āghācha; he, however, may have known no more
than others knew of her descent; the second, that Māhīm forcibly
took Dil-dār’s child Hind-āl to rear; she was the older wife and
the mother of the heir, but could she have taken the upper hand
over a Mīrān-shāhī? A circumstance complicating the question
of Salīma’s maternal descent is, that historians searching the
<i>Bābur-nāma</i> or its Persian translation the <i>Wāqi‘āt-i-bāburī</i> for
information about the three daughters of Maḥmūd <i>Mīrān-shāhī</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_714" id="Page_714">[Pg 714]</a></span>and Pasha <i>Bahārlū Turkmān</i>, would find an incomplete record,
one in which the husbands of the first and second daughters are
mentioned and nothing is said about the third who was Bābur’s
wife and the grandmother of Salīma. Bābur himself appears to
have left the record as it is, meaning to fill it in later; presumably
he waited for the names of the elder two sisters to complete his
details of the three. In the Ḥaidarabad Codex, which there is
good ground for supposing a copy of his original manuscript,
about three lines are left blank (f. 27) as if awaiting information;
in most manuscripts, however, this indication of intention is
destroyed by running the defective passage on to join the next
sentence. Some chance remark of a less well-known writer,
may clear up the obscurity and show that Sālḥa was Dil-dār.</p>

<p>Māhīm’s case seems one having a different cause for silence
about her parentage. When she was married in Herāt, shortly
after the death of Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā, Bābur had neither wife nor
child. What Abū’l-faẓl tells about her is vague; her father’s name
is not told; she is said to have belonged to a noble Khurāsān
family, to have been related (<i>nisbat-i-khwesh</i>) to Sl. Ḥusain
Mīrzā and to have traced her descent to Shaikh Aḥmad of Jām.
If her birth had been high, even though not royal, it is strange
that it is not stated by Bābur when he records the birth of her
son Humāyūn, incidentally by Gul-badan, or more precisely by
Abū’l-faẓl. Her brothers belonged to Khost, and to judge from a
considerable number of small records, seem to have been quiet,
unwarlike Khwājas. Her marriage took place in a year of which
a full record survives; it is one in the composed narrative, not
in the diary. In the following year, this also being one included
in the composed narrative, Bābur writes of his meeting with
Ma‘ṣūma <i>Mīrān-shāhī</i> in Herāt, of their mutual attraction, and
of their marriage. If the marriage with Humāyūn’s mother had
been an equal alliance, it would agree with Bābur’s custom to
mention its occurrence, and to give particulars about Māhīm’s
descent.<a name="FNanchor_2749" id="FNanchor_2749"></a><a href="#Footnote_2749" class="fnanchor">2749</a></p>

<p class="indent"><i>i. Mr. William Erskine’s estimate of Bābur.</i></p>

<p>“Z̤ahīru’d-dīn Muḥammad Bābur was undoubtedly one of the
most illustrious men of his age, and one of the most eminent
and accomplished princes that ever adorned an Asiatic throne.
He is represented as having been above the middle size, of great
vigour of body, fond of all field and warlike sports, an excellent
swordsman, and a skilful archer. As a proof of his bodily
strength, it is mentioned, that he used to leap from one pinnacle
to another of the pinnacled ramparts used in the East, in his
double-soled boots; and that he even frequently took a man
under each arm and went leaping along the rampart from one of
the pointed pinnacles to another. Having been early trained
to the conduct of business, and tutored in the school of adversity,
the powers of his mind received full development. He ascended
the throne at the age of twelve, and before he had attained his
twentieth year, had shared every variety of fortune; he had not
only been the ruler of subject provinces but had been in thraldom
to his own ambitious nobles, and obliged to conceal every sentiment
of his heart; he had been alternately hailed and obeyed as
a conqueror and deliverer by rich and extensive kingdoms, and
forced to lurk in the deserts and mountains of Farghāna as
a houseless wanderer. Down to the last dregs of life, we perceive
in him strong feelings of affection for his early friends and early
enjoyments. * * * He had been taught betimes, by the voice
of events that cannot lie, that he was a man dependent on the
kindness and fidelity of other men; and, in his dangers and
escapes with his followers, had learned that he was only one of
an association. * * * The native benevolence and gaiety of his
disposition seems ever to overflow on all around him; * * * of his
companions in arms he speaks with the frank gaiety of a soldier.
* * * Ambitious he was and fond of conquest and glory in all
its shapes; the enterprise in which he was for a season engaged,
seems to have absorbed his whole soul, and all his faculties were
exerted to bring it to a fortunate issue. His elastic mind was
not broken by discomfiture, and few who have achieved such
glorious conquests, have suffered more numerous or more decisive
defeats. His personal courage was conspicuous during his whole
life. Upon the whole, if we review with impartiality the history<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_716" id="Page_716">[Pg 716]</a></span>
of Asia, we find few princes entitled to rank higher than Bābur
in genius and accomplishments. * * * In activity of mind, in
the gay equanimity and unbroken spirit with which he bore the
extremes of good and bad fortune, in the possession of the manly
and social virtues, in his love of letters and his success in the
cultivation of them, we shall probably find no other Asiatic
prince who can justly be placed beside him.”</p>

<h2>APPENDICES.</h2>

<h3><a name="a" id="a"></a>A.&mdash;THE SITE AND DISAPPEARANCE OF
OLD AKHSĪ.</h3>

<p>Some modern writers, amongst whom are Dr. Schuyler,
General Nalivkine and Mr. Pumpelly, have inferred from the
Bābur-nāma account of Akhsī, (in its translations?) that the
landslip through which Bābur’s father died and the disappearance
of old Akhsī were brought about by erosion. Seen by the
light of modern information, this erosion theory does not seem
to cover the whole ground and some other cause seems
necessary in explanation of both events.</p>

<p>For convenience of reference, the Bābur-nāma passages required,
are quoted here, with their translations.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Ḥai. MS. f. 4b. <i>Saiḥūn daryā-sī qūrghānī astīdīn āqār. Qūrghānī

<p>Of this the translations are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Pers. trans. (I.O. 217, f. 3<i>b</i>): <i>Daryā-i Saiḥūn az pāyhā qila‘-i
o mīrezad u qila‘-i o bar jar balandī wāqi‘ shuda ba jāy khandaq jarhā-i
‘umīq uftāda. ‘U. Sh. M. kah ānrā pāy-takht sākhta, yak du martaba az

<p>(<i>b</i>) Erskine (p. 5, translating from the Persian): ‘The river Saiḥūn
flows under the walls of the castle. The castle is situated on a high
precipice, and the steep ravines around serve instead of a moat. When
U. Sh. M. made it his capital he, in one or two instances, scarped the
ravines outside the fort.’</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) De Courteille (i, 8, translating from Ilminsky’s imprint, p. 6):
‘Le Seihoun coule au pied de la fortresse qui se dresse sur le sommet
d’un ravin, dont les profondeurs lui tiennent lieu d’un fossé. ‘U. Sh.
M. &agrave; l'époque o&ugrave; il en avait fait son capitale, avait augmenté &agrave; une ou
deux réprises, les escarpements qui la ceignent naturellement.’</p></div>

<p>Concerning ‘Umar Shaikh’s death, the words needed are
(f. 6<i>b</i>);&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Maẕkūr būlūb aīdī kīm Akhsī qūrghānī buland jar austīdā wāqi‘

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii">[Pg ii]</a></span>
<i>kabūtar-khāna bīla aūchūb shunqār būldī</i>;&mdash;'It has been mentioned
that the walled-town of Akhsī is situated above ravine(s). The royal
dwellings are along a ravine. The Mīrzā, having flown with his
pigeons and their house from the ravine, became a falcon (<i>i.e.</i> died).’</p></div>

<p class="tb">A few particulars about Akhsī will shew that, in the translations
just quoted, certain small changes of wording are dictated
by what, amongst other writers, Kostenko and von Schwarz
have written about the oases of Turkistān.</p>

<p>The name Akhsī, as used by Ibn Haukal, Yāqūt and Bābur,
describes an oasis township, <i>i.e.</i> a walled-town with its adjacent
cultivated lands. In Yāqūt’s time Akhsī had a second circumvallation,
presumably less for defence than for the protection of
crops against wild animals. The oasis was created by the
Kāsān-water,<a name="FNanchor_2750" id="FNanchor_2750"></a><a href="#Footnote_2750" class="fnanchor">2750</a> upon the riverain loess of the right and higher
bank of the Saiḥūn (Sīr), on level ground west of the junction
of the Nārīn and the Qarā-daryā, west too of spurs from the
northern hills which now abut upon the river. Yāqūt locates
it in the 12th century, at one <i>farsākh</i> (<i>circa</i> 4 m.) north of
the river.<a name="FNanchor_2751" id="FNanchor_2751"></a><a href="#Footnote_2751" class="fnanchor">2751</a> Depending as it did solely on the Kāsān-water,
nothing dictated its location close to the Sīr, along which there
is now, and there seems to have been in the 12th century, a
strip of waste land. Bābur says of Akhsī what Kostenko says
(i, 321) of modern Tāshkīnt, that it stood above ravines (<i>jarlār</i>).
These were natural or artificial channels of the Kāsān-water.<a name="FNanchor_2752" id="FNanchor_2752"></a><a href="#Footnote_2752" class="fnanchor">2752</a></p>

<p class="tb">To turn now to the translations;&mdash;Mr. Erskine imaged Akhsī
as a castle, high on a precipice in process of erosion by the Sīr.
But Bābur’s word, <i>qūrghān</i> means the walled-town; his word for a
castle is <i>ark</i>, citadel; and his <i>jar</i>, a cleft, is not rendered by
‘precipice.’ Again;&mdash;it is no more necessary to understand that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">[Pg iii]</a></span>the Sīr flowed close to the walls than it is to understand, when
one says the Thames flows past below Richmond, that it
washes the houses on the hill.</p>

<p>The key to the difficulties in the Turkī passage is provided
by a special use of the word <i>jar</i> for not only natural ravines
but artificial water-cuts for irrigation. This use of it makes
clear that what ‘Umar Shaikh did at Akhsī was not to make
escarpments but to cut new water-channels. Presumably he
joined those ‘further out’ on the deltaic fan, on the east and
west of the town, so as to secure a continuous defensive cleft
round the town<a name="FNanchor_2753" id="FNanchor_2753"></a><a href="#Footnote_2753" class="fnanchor">2753</a> or it may be, in order to bring it more water.</p>

<p>Concerning the historic pigeon-house (f. 6<i>b</i>), it can be said
safely that it did not fall into the Sīr; it fell from a <i>jar</i>, and in
this part of its course, the river flows in a broad bed, with a
low left bank. Moreover the Mīrzā’s residence was in the
walled-town (f. 110<i>b</i>) and there his son stayed 9 years after the
accident. The slip did not affect the safety of the residence
therefore; it may have been local to the birds’ house. It will
have been due to some ordinary circumstance since no cause
for it is mentioned by Bābur, Ḥaidar or Abū’l-faẓl. If it had
marked the crisis of the Sīr’s approach, Akhsī could hardly
have been described, 25 years later, as a strong fort.</p>

<p class="tb">Something is known of Akhsī, in the 10th, the 12th, the
15th and the 19th centuries, which testifies to sæcular
decadence. Ibn Haukal and Yāqūt give the township an extent
of 3 <i>farsākh</i> (12 miles), which may mean from one side to
an opposite one. Yāqūt’s description of it mentions four
gates, each opening into well-watered lands extending a whole
<i>farsākh</i>, in other words it had a ring of garden-suburb four
miles wide.</p>

<p>Two meanings have been given to Bābur’s words indicating
the status of the oasis in the 15th century. They are,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span><i>maḥallātī qūrghān-dīn bīr shar‘ī yurāqrāq tūshūb tūr</i>. They
have been understood as saying that the suburbs were two
miles from their <i>urbs</i>. This may be right but I hesitate to
accept it without pointing out that the words may mean, ‘Its
suburbs extend two miles farther than the walled-town.’
Whichever verbal reading is correct, reveals a decayed oasis.</p>

<p>In the 19th century, Nalivkine and Ujfalvy describe the
place then bearing the name Akhsī, as a small village, a
mere winter-station, at some distance from the river’s bank,
that bank then protected from denudation by a sand-bank.</p>

<p>Three distinctly-marked stages of decadence in the oasis
township are thus indicated by Yāqūt, Bābur and the two
modern travellers.</p>

<p class="tb">It is necessary to say something further about the position of
the suburbs in the 15th century. Bābur quotes as especially
suitable to Akhsī, the proverbial questions, ‘Where is the
village?'<a name="FNanchor_2754" id="FNanchor_2754"></a><a href="#Footnote_2754" class="fnanchor">2754</a> (qy. Akhsī-kīnt.) ‘Where are the trees?’ and these
might be asked by some-one in the suburbs unable to see Akhsī
or <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>. But granting that there were no suburbs within
two miles of the town, why had the whole inner circle, two
miles of Yāqūt’s four, gone out of cultivation? Erosion would
have affected only land between the river and the town.</p>

<p>Again;&mdash;if the Sīr only were working in the 15th century
to destroy a town standing on the Kāsān-water, how is it that
this stream does not yet reach the Sīr?</p>

<p class="tb">Various ingatherings of information create the impression
that failure of Kāsān-water has been the dominant factor in
the loss of the Akhsī township. Such failure might be due to
the general desiccation of Central Asia and also to increase of
cultivation in the Kāsān-valley itself. There may have been
erosion, and social and military change may have had its part,
but for the loss of the oasis lands and for, as a sequel, the decay
of the town, desiccation seems a sufficient cause.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span></p>
<p>The Kāsān-water still supports an oasis on its riverain slope,
the large Aūzbeg town of Tūpa-qūrghān (Town-of-the-hill),
from the modern castle of which a superb view is had up the
Kāsān-valley, now thickly studded with villages.<a name="FNanchor_2755" id="FNanchor_2755"></a><a href="#Footnote_2755" class="fnanchor">2755</a></p>

<h3><a name="b" id="b"></a>B.&mdash;THE BIRDS, QĪL QŪYIRŪGH AND
BĀGHRĪ QARĀ.</h3>

<p>Describing a small bird (<i>qūsh-qīna</i>), abundant in the Qarshī
district (f. 49<i>b</i>), Bābur names it the <i>qīl-qūyirūgh</i>, horse-tail, and
says it resembles the <i>bāghrī qarā</i>.</p>

<p>Later on he writes (f. 280) that the <i>bāghrī qarā</i> of India is
smaller and more slender than ‘those’ <i>i.e.</i> of Transoxiana
(f. 49<i>b</i>, n. 1), the blackness of its breast less deep, and its cry
less piercing.</p>

<p>We have had difficulty in identifying the birds but at length
conclude that the <i>bāghrī qarā</i> of Transoxiana is <i>Pterocles
arenarius</i>, Pallas’s black-bellied sand-grouse and that the Indian
one is a smaller sand-grouse, perhaps a <i>Syrrhaptes</i>. As the <i>qīl
qūyirūgh</i> resembles the other two, it may be a yet smaller
<i>Syrrhaptes</i>.</p>

<p>Muḥ. Ṣāliḥ, writing of sport Shaibāq Khān had in Qarshī
(<i>Shaibānī-nāma</i>, Vambéry, p. 192) mentions the ‘Little bird
(<i>murghak</i>) of Qarshī,’ as on all sides making lament. The
Sang-lākh<a name="FNanchor_2756" id="FNanchor_2756"></a><a href="#Footnote_2756" class="fnanchor">2756</a> gives its Persian name as <i>khar-pala</i>, ass-hair, says it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>flies in large flocks and resembles the <i>bāghrī qarā</i>. Of the
latter he writes as abundant in the open country and as
making noise (<i>bāghīr</i>).</p>

<p>The Sang-lākh (f. 119) gives the earliest and most informing
account we have found of the <i>bāghrī qarā</i>. Its says the bird is
larger than a pigeon, marked with various colours, yellow
especially, black-breasted and a dweller in the stony and waterless
desert. These details are followed by a quotation from
‘Alī-sher <i>Nawā’ī</i>, in which he likens his own heart to that of
the bird of the desert, presumably referring to the gloom of the
bird’s plumage. Three synonyms are then given; Ar. <i>qit̤ā</i>, one
due to its cry (Meninsky); Pers. <i>sang-shikan</i>, stone-eating,
(Steingass, <i>sang-khwāra</i>, stone-eating); and Turkī <i>bāghīr-tīlāq</i>
which refers, I think, to its cry.</p>

<p>Morier (Ḥājī Bābā) in his <i>Second journey through Persia</i>
(Lond. 1818, p. 181), mentions that a bird he calls the black-breasted
partridge, (<i>i.e.</i> <i>Francolinus vulgaris</i>) is known in
Turkish as <i>bokara kara</i> and in Persian as <i>siyāh-sīna</i>, both names,
(he says), meaning black-breast; that it has a horse-shoe of
black feathers round the forepart of the trunk, more strongly
marked in the female than in the male; that they fly in flocks
of which he saw immense numbers near Tabrīz (p. 283), have
a soft note, inhabit the plains, and, once settled, do not run.
Cock and hen alike have a small spur,&mdash;a characteristic, it may
be said, identifying rather with <i>Francolinus vulgaris</i> than with
<i>Pterocles arenarius</i>. Against this identification, however, is
Mr. Blandford’s statement that <i>siyāh-sīna</i> (Morier’s <i>bokara kara</i>)
is <i>Pterocles arenarius</i> (Report of the Persian Boundary Commission,
ii, 271).</p>

<p>In Afghānistān and Bikanir, the sand-grouse is called <i>tūtūrak</i>
and <i>boora kurra</i> (Jerdon, ii, 498). Scully explains <i>baghītāq</i> as
<i>Pterocles arenarius</i>.</p>

<p>Perhaps I may mention something making me doubt whether
it is correct to translate <i>bāghrī qarā</i> by <i>black-liver</i> and <i>gorge-noir</i>
or other names in which the same meaning is expressed. To
translate thus, is to understand a Turkī noun and adjective in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
Persian construction, and to make exception to the rule, amply
exemplified in lists of birds, that Turkī names of birds are
commonly in Turkī construction, <i>e.g.</i> <i>qarā bāsh</i> (black-head),
<i>āq-bāsh</i> (white-head), <i>sārīgh-sūndūk</i> (yellow-headed wagtail).
<i>Bāghīr</i> may refer to the cry of the bird. We learn from
Mr. Ogilvie Grant that the Mongol name for the sand-grouse
<i>njūpterjūn</i>, is derived from its cry in flight, <i>truck</i>, <i>truck</i>, and its
Arabic name <i>qit̤ā</i> is said by Meninsky to be derived from its
cry <i>kaetha</i>, <i>kaetha</i>. Though the dissimilarity of the two cries is
against taking the <i>njūpterjūn</i> and the <i>qit̤ā</i> to be of one class of
sand-grouse, the significance of the derivation of the names
remains, and shows that there are examples in support of
thinking that when a sand-grouse is known as <i>bāghrī qarā</i>, it
may be so known because of its cry (<i>bāghir</i>).</p>

<p>The word <i>qarā</i> finds suggestive interpretation in a B. N.
phrase (f. 72<i>b</i>) <i>Taṃbal-nīng qarā-sī</i>, Taṃbal’s blackness, <i>i.e.</i> the
dark mass of his moving men, seen at a distance. It is used
also for an indefinite number, <i>e.g.</i> ‘family, servants, retainers,
followers, <i>qarā</i>,’ and I think it may imply a massed flock.</p>

<p>Bābur’s words (f. 280) <i>bāghrī-nīng qarā-sī ham kam dūr</i>, [its
belly (lit. liver) also is less black], do not necessarily contradict
the view that the word <i>bāghrī</i> in the bird’s name means crying.
The root <i>bāgh</i> has many and pliable derivatives; I suspect
both Bābur (here) and Muḥ. Ṣāliḥ (l. c.) of ringing changes
on words.</p>

<h3><a name="c" id="c"></a>C.&mdash;ON THE GOSHA-GĪR.</h3>

<p>I am indebted to my husband’s examination of two Persian
MSS. on archery for an explanation of the word <i>gosha-gīr</i>, in
its technical sense in archery. The works consulted are the
Cyclopædia of Archery (<i>Kulliyatu’r-rāmī</i> I. O. 2771) and the
Archer’s Guide (<i>Hidāyatu’r-rāmī</i> I. O. 2768).</p>

<p>It should be premised that in archery, the word <i>gosha</i> describes,
in the arrow, the notch by which it grips and can be
carried on the string, and, in the bow, both the tip (horn) and
the notch near the tip in which the string catches. It is explained
by Vullers as <i>cornu et crena arc&ucirc;s cui immititur nervus</i>.</p>

<p>Two passages in the Cyclopædia of Archery (f. 9 and f. 36<i>b</i>)
shew <i>gosha</i> as the bow-tip. One says that to bend the bow,
two men must grasp the two <i>gosha</i>; the other reports a tradition
that the Archangel Gabriel brought a bow having its two <i>gosha</i>
(tips) made of ruby. The same book directs that the <i>gosha</i> be
made of seasoned ivory, the Archer’s Guide prescribing seasoned
mulberry wood.</p>

<p>The C. of A. (f. 125<i>b</i>) says that a bowman should never be
without two things, his arrows and his <i>gosha-gīr</i>. The <i>gosha-gīr</i>
may be called an item of the repairing kit; it is an implement
(f. 53) for making good a warped bow-tip and for holding the
string into a displaced notch. It is known also as the <i>chaprās</i>,
brooch or buckle, and the <i>kardāng</i>; and is said to bear these
names because it fastens in the string. Its shape is that of the
upper part of the Ar. letter <i>jīm</i>, two converging lines of which
the lower curves slightly outward. It serves to make good a
warped bow, without the use of fire and it should be kept upon
the bow-tip till this has reverted to its original state. Until
the warp has been straightened by the <i>gosha-gīr</i>, the bow must
be kept from the action of fire because it, (composite of sinew
and glutinous substance,) is of the nature of wax.</p>

<p>The same implement can be used to straighten the middle of
the bow, the <i>kamān khāna</i>. It is then called <i>kar-dāng</i>. It can<span class='pagenum'><a name="a_ix" id="a_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
be used there on condition that there are not two <i>daur</i> (curves)
in the bow. If there are two the bow cannot be repaired without
fire. The <i>halāl daur</i> is said to be characteristic of the
Turkish bow. There are three <i>daur</i>. I am indebted to Mr. Inigo
Simon for the suggestions that <i>daur</i> in this connection means
<i>warp</i> and that the three twists (<i>daur</i>) may be those of one horn
(<i>gosha</i>), of the whole bow warped in one curve, and of the two
horns warped in opposite directions.</p>

<p>Of repair to the <i>kamān-khāna</i> it is said further that if no <i>kardāng</i>
be available, its work can be done by means of a stick and
string, and if the damage be slight only, the bow and the string
can be tightly tied together till the bow comes straight. ‘And
the cure is with God!'</p>

<p>Both manuscripts named contain much technical information.
Some parts of this are included in my husband’s article,
<i>Oriental Crossbows</i> (A. Q. R. 1911, p. 1). Sir Ralph Payne-Gallwey’s
interesting book on the Cross-bow allows insight into
the fine handicraft of Turkish bow-making.</p>

<h3><a name="d" id="d"></a>D.&mdash;ON THE RESCUE PASSAGE.</h3>

<p>I have omitted from my translation an account of Bābur’s
rescue from expected death, although it is with the Ḥaidarābād
Codex, because closer acquaintance with its details has led both
my husband and myself to judge it spurious. We had welcomed
it because, being with the true Bābur-nāma text, it
accredited the same account found in the Kehr-Ilminsky text,
and also because, however inefficiently, it did something
towards filling the gap found elsewhere within 908 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span></p>

<p>It is in the Ḥaidarābād MS. (f. 118<i>b</i>), in Kehr’s MS. (p. 385),
in Ilminsky’s imprint (p. 144), in <i>Les Mémoires de Bābour</i> (i, 255)
and with the St. P. University Codex, which is a copy of
Kehr’s.<span class='pagenum'><a name="a_x" id="a_x">[Pg x]</a></span></p>

<p>On the other hand, it is not with the Elphinstone Codex
(f. 89<i>b</i>); that it was not with the archetype of that codex the
scribe’s note shews (f. 90); it is with neither of the <i>Wāqi‘āt-i-bāburī</i>
(Pers. translations) nor with Leyden and Erskine’s
<i>Memoirs</i> (p. 122).<a name="FNanchor_2757" id="FNanchor_2757"></a><a href="#Footnote_2757" class="fnanchor">2757</a></p>

<p>Before giving our grounds for rejecting what has been offered
to fill the gap of 908 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> a few words must be said about the
lacuna itself. Nothing indicates that Bābur left it and, since
both in the Elphinstone Codex and its archetype, the sentence
preceding it lacks the terminal verb, it seems due merely to
loss of pages. That the loss, if any, was of early date is clear,&mdash;the
Elph. MS. itself being copied not later than 1567 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span> (JRAS.
1907, p. 137).</p>

<p>Two known circumstances, both of earlier date than that of
the Elphinstone Codex, might have led to the loss,&mdash;the first is
the storm which in 935 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> scattered Bābur’s papers (f. 376<i>b</i>),
the second, the vicissitudes to which Humāyūn’s library was
exposed in his exile.<a name="FNanchor_2758" id="FNanchor_2758"></a><a href="#Footnote_2758" class="fnanchor">2758</a> Of the two the first seems the more
probable cause.</p>

<p>The rupture of a story at a point so critical as that of Bābur’s
danger in Karnān would tempt to its completion; so too would
wish to make good the composed part of the Bābur-nāma.
Humāyūn annotated the archetype of the Elphinstone Codex
a good deal but he cannot have written the Rescue passage if
only because he was in a position to avoid some of its inaccuracies.</p>

<p class="center">CONTEXT AND TRANSLATION OF THE RESCUE
PASSAGE.</p>

<p>To facilitate reference, I quote the last words preceding the
gap purported to be filled by the Rescue passage, from several
texts;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="a_xi" id="a_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span></p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) Elphinstone MS. f. 89<i>b</i>,&mdash;<i>Qūptūm. Bāgh gosha-sī-gha
bārdīm. Aūzūm bīla andesha qīldīm. Dīdīm kīm kīshī agar yūz
u agar mīng yāshāsā, ākhir hech....</i></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The Ḥai. MS. (f. 118<i>b</i>) varies from the Elphinstone by
omitting the word <i>hech</i> and adding <i>aūlmāk kīrāk</i>, he must die.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Pāyanda-ḥasan’s <i>Wāqi‘āt-i-bāburī</i> (I. O. 215, f. 96<i>b</i>),&mdash;<i>Barkhwāstam
u dar gosha-i bāgh raftam. Ba khūd andesha karda,
guftam kah agar kase ṣad sāl yā hazār sāl ‘umr dāshta bāshad,
ākhir hech ast.</i> (It will be seen that this text has the <i>hech</i> of
the Elph. MS.)</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) ‘Abdu’r-raḥīm’s <i>Wāqi‘āt-i-bāburī</i> (I. O. 217, f. 79),&mdash;<i>Barkhwāstam
u ba gosha-i-bāgh raftam. Ba khūd andeshīdam u
guftam kah agar kase ṣad sāl u agar hazār sāl ‘umr bayābad ākhir....</i></p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) Muḥ. <i>Shīrāzī’s</i> lith. ed. (p. 75) finishes the sentence with
<i>ākhir khūd bāyad murd</i>, at last one must die,&mdash;varying as it frequently
does, from both of the <i>Wāqi‘āt</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) Kehr’s MS. (p. 383-454), Ilminsky, p. 144,&mdash;<i>Qūpūb bāghnīng
bīr būrjī-ghā bārīb, khāt̤irīm-ghā kīltūrdīm kīm agar adam
yūz yīl u agar mīng yīl tīrīk būlsā, ākhir aūlmāk dīn aūzkā chāra
yūq tūr.</i> (I rose. Having gone to a tower of the garden,
I brought it to my mind that if a person be alive 100 years
or a thousand years, at last he has no help other than
to die.)</p>

<p class="tb">The Rescue passage is introduced by a Persian couplet,
identified by my husband as from Niz̤āmī’s <i>Khusrau u Shīrīn</i>,
which is as follows;&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">I steadied myself for death (<i>qarār bīrdīm</i>). In that garden a stream came
flowing;<a name="FNanchor_2759" id="FNanchor_2759"></a><a href="#Footnote_2759" class="fnanchor">2759</a> I made ablution; I recited the prayer of two inclinations (<i>ra‘kat</i>);

my eyes closed in sleep.<a name="FNanchor_2760" id="FNanchor_2760"></a><a href="#Footnote_2760" class="fnanchor">2760</a> I am seeing<a name="FNanchor_2761" id="FNanchor_2761"></a><a href="#Footnote_2761" class="fnanchor">2761</a> that Khwāja Yaq‘ūb, the son of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="a_xii" id="a_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
Khwāja Yaḥyā and grandson of His Highness Khwāja ‘Ubaidu’l-lāh, came
facing me, mounted on a piebald horse, with a large company of piebald horsemen
(<i>sic</i>).<a name="FNanchor_2762" id="FNanchor_2762"></a><a href="#Footnote_2762" class="fnanchor">2762</a> He said: ‘Lay sorrow aside! Khwāja <i>Aḥrār</i> (<i>i.e.</i> ‘Ubaidu’l-lāh)
has sent me to you; he said, “We, having asked help for him (<i>i.e.</i> Bābur),
will seat him on the royal throne;<a name="FNanchor_2763" id="FNanchor_2763"></a><a href="#Footnote_2763" class="fnanchor">2763</a> wherever difficulty befalls him, let him
look towards us (lit. bring us to sight) and call us to mind; there will we be
present.” Now, in this hour, victory and success are on your side; lift up
your head! awake!'</p>

<p class="small">At that time I awoke happy, when Yūsuf and those with him<a name="FNanchor_2764" id="FNanchor_2764"></a><a href="#Footnote_2764" class="fnanchor">2764</a> were giving
one another advice. ‘We will make a pretext to deceive; to seize and bind<a name="FNanchor_2765" id="FNanchor_2765"></a><a href="#Footnote_2765" class="fnanchor">2765</a>
is necessary.’ Hearing these words, I said, ‘Your words are of this sort,
but I will see which of you will come to my presence to take me.’ I was
saying this when outside the garden wall<a name="FNanchor_2766" id="FNanchor_2766"></a><a href="#Footnote_2766" class="fnanchor">2766</a> came the noise of approaching
horsemen. Yūsuf <i>darogha</i> said, ‘If we had taken you to Taṃbal our affairs
would have gone forward. Now he has sent again many persons to seize
you.’ He was certain that this noise might be the footfall of the horses of
those sent by Taṃbal. On hearing those words anxiety grew upon me;
what to do I did not know. At this time those horsemen, not happening to
find the garden gate, broke down the wall where it was old (and) came in.
I saw (<i>kūrsām</i>, lit. might see) that Qutluq Muḥ. <i>Barlās</i> and Bābā-i <i>Pargharī</i>,
my life-devoted servants, having arrived [with], it may be, ten, fifteen,
twenty persons, were approaching. Having flung themselves from their
horses,<a name="FNanchor_2767" id="FNanchor_2767"></a><a href="#Footnote_2767" class="fnanchor">2767</a> bent the knee from afar and showed respect, they fell at my feet. In
that state (<i>ḥal</i>) such ecstasy (<i>ḥāl</i>) came over me that you might say (<i>goyā</i>)
God gave me life from a new source (<i>bāsh</i>). I said, ‘Seize and bind that
Yūsuf <i>darogha</i> and these here (<i>tūrghān</i>) hireling mannikins.’ These same
mannikins had taken to flight. They (<i>i.e.</i> the rescuers), having taken them,
one by one, here and there, brought them bound. I said, ‘Where do you
come from? How did you get news?’ Qutluq Muḥ. <i>Barlās</i> said: ‘When,
having fled from Akhsī, we were separated from you in the flight, we went to
Andijān when the Khāns also came to Andijān. I saw a vision that Khwāja
‘Ubaidu’l-lāh said, “Bābur <i>pādshāh</i><a name="FNanchor_2768" id="FNanchor_2768"></a><a href="#Footnote_2768" class="fnanchor">2768</a> is in a village called Karnān; go and
bring him, since the royal seat (<i>masnad</i>) has become his possession (<i>ta‘alluq</i>).”
I having seen this vision and become happy, represented (the matter) to the
Elder Khān (and) the Younger Khān. I said to the Khāns, “I have five or
six younger brothers (and) sons; do you add a few soldiers. I will go
through the Karnān side and bring news.” The Khāns said, “It occurs to our
minds also that (he) may have gone that same road (?).” They appointed ten
persons; they said, “Having gone in that direction (<i>sārī</i>) and made very sure,
bring news. Would to God you might get true news!” We were saying this
when Bābā-i <i>Parghārī</i> said, “I too will go and seek.” He also having agreed
with two young men, (his) younger brothers, we rode out. It is three days
<span class='pagenum'><a name="a_xiii" id="a_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
to-day that we are on the road. Thank God! we have found you.’ They
said (<i>dīdīlār</i>, for <i>dīb</i>). They spoke (<i>aītīlār</i>), ‘Make a move! Ride off!
Take these bound ones with you! To stay here is not well; Taṃbal has had
news of your coming here; go, in whatever way, and join yourself to the
Khāns!’ At that time we having ridden out, moved towards Andijān. It
was two days that we had eaten no food; the evening prayer had come when
we found a sheep, went on, dismounted, killed, and roasted. Of that same
roast we ate as much as a feast. After that we rode on, hurried forward, made
a five days’ journey in a day and two nights, came and entered Andijān. I
saluted my uncle the Elder Khān (and) my uncle the Younger Khān, and
made recital of past days. With the Khāns I spent four months. My
servants, who had gone looking in every place, gathered themselves together;
there were more than 300 persons. It came to my mind (<i>kīm</i>), ‘How long
must I wander, a vagabond (<i>sar-gardān</i>),<a name="FNanchor_2769" id="FNanchor_2769"></a><a href="#Footnote_2769" class="fnanchor">2769</a> in this Farghāna country? I will
make search (<i>t̤alab</i>) on every side (<i>dīb</i>).’ Having said, I rode out in the
month of Muḥarram to seek Khurāsān, and I went out from the country of
Farghāna.<a name="FNanchor_2770" id="FNanchor_2770"></a><a href="#Footnote_2770" class="fnanchor">2770</a></p>

<p class="center">REASONS AGAINST THE REJECTION OF THE
RESCUE PASSAGE.</p>

<p>Two circumstances have weight against rejecting the passage,
its presence with the Ḥaidarābād Codex and its acceptance by
Dr. Ilminsky and M. de Courteille.</p>

<p>That it is with the Codex is a matter needing consideration
and this the more that it is the only extra matter there found.
Not being with the Persian translations, it cannot be of early
date. It seems likely to owe its place of honour to distinguished
authorship and may well be one of the four portions (<i>juzwe</i>)
mentioned by Jahāngīr in the Tuzūk-i-jahāngīrī,<a name="FNanchor_2771" id="FNanchor_2771"></a><a href="#Footnote_2771" class="fnanchor">2771</a> as added by
himself to his ancestor’s book. If so, it may be mentioned, it
will have been with Bābur’s autograph MS. [now not to be
found], from which the Ḥaidarābād Codex shews signs of being
a direct copy.<a name="FNanchor_2772" id="FNanchor_2772"></a><a href="#Footnote_2772" class="fnanchor">2772</a></p>

<p>[The incongruity of the Rescue passage with the true text has
<span class='pagenum'><a name="a_xiv" id="a_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>been indicated by foot-notes to the translation of it already
given. What condemns it on historic and other grounds will
follow.]</p>

<p class="tb">On linguistic grounds it is a strong argument in its favour
that Dr. Ilminsky and M. de Courteille should have accepted it
but the argument loses weight when some of the circumstances
of their work are taken into account.</p>

<p>In the first place, it is not strictly accurate to regard
Dr. Ilminsky as accepting it unquestioned, because it is
covered by his depreciatory remarks, made in his preface, on
Kehr’s text. He, like M. de Courteille, worked with a single
Turkī MS. and neither of the two ever saw a complete true
text. When their source (the Kehr-Ilminsky) was able to be
collated with the Elph. and Ḥai. MSS. much and singular
divergence was discovered.</p>

<p class="tb">I venture to suggest what appears to me to explain M. de
Courteille’s acceptance of the Rescue passage. Down to its
insertion, the Kehr-Ilminsky text is so continuously and so
curiously corrupt that it seems necessary to regard it as being
a re-translation into Turkī from one of the Persian translations
of the <i>Bābur-nāma</i>. There being these textual defects in it, it
would create on the mind of a reader initiated through it, only,
in the book, an incorrect impression of Bābur’s style and
vocabulary, and such a reader would feel no transition when
passing on from it to the Rescue passage.</p>

<p>In opposition to this explanation, it might be said that a
wrong standard set up by the corrupt text, would or could be
changed by the excellence of later parts of the Kehr-Ilminsky
one. In words, this is sound, no doubt, and such reflex criticism
is now easy, but more than the one defective MS. was
wanted even to suggest the need of such reflex criticism. The
<i>Bābur-nāma</i> is lengthy, ponderous to poise and grasp, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="a_xv" id="a_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
work on it is still tentative, even with the literary gains since
the Seventies.</p>

<p>Few of the grounds which weigh with us for the rejection of
the Rescue passage were known to Dr. Ilminsky or M. de
Courteille;&mdash;the two good Codices bring each its own and
varied help; Teufel’s critique on the ‘Fragments,’ though made
without acquaintance with those adjuncts as they stand in Kehr’s
own volume, is of much collateral value; several useful oriental
histories seem not to have been available for M. de Courteille’s
use. I may add, for my own part, that I have the great
advantage of my husband’s companionship and the guidance
of his wide acquaintance with related oriental books. In truth,
looking at the drawbacks now removed, an earlier acceptance
of the passage appears as natural as does today’s rejection.</p>

<p class="center">GROUNDS FOR REJECTING THE RESCUE
PASSAGE.</p>

<p>The grounds for rejecting the passage need here little more
than recapitulation from my husband’s article in the JASB.
1910, p. 221, and are as follows;&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>i. The passage is in neither of the <i>Wāqi‘āt-i-bāburī</i>.</p>

<p>ii. The dreams detailed are too &agrave; propos and marvellous for
credence.</p>

<p>iii. Khwāja Yaḥyā is not known to have had a son, named
Ya‘qūb.</p>

<p>iv. The <i>Bābur-nāma</i> does not contain the names assigned to
the rescuers.</p>

<p>v. The Khāns were not in Andijān and Bābur did not go
there.</p>

<p>vi. He did not set out for Khurāsān after spending 4 months
with The Khāns but after Aḥmad’s death (end of 909 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>),
while Maḥmud was still in Eastern Turkistān and after about
a year’s stay in Sūkh.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="a_xvi" id="a_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
vii. The followers who gathered to him were not ‘more than
300’ but between 2 and 300.</p>

<p>viii. The ‘3 days,’ and the ‘day and two nights,’ and the
‘5 days’ journey was one of some 70 miles, and one recorded
as made in far less time.</p>

<p>ix. The passage is singularly inadequate to fill a gap of 14 to
16 months, during which events of the first importance occurred
to Bābur and to the Chaghatāī dynasty.</p>

<p>x. Khwāja <i>Aḥrārī’s</i> promises did nothing to fulfil Bābur’s
wishes for 908 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> while those of Ya‘qūb for immediate
victory were closely followed by defeat and exile. Bābur knew
the facts; the passage cannot be his. It looks as though the
writer saw Bābur in Karnān across Tīmūrid success in
Hindūstān.</p>

<p>xi. The style and wording of the passage are not in harmony
with those of the true text.</p></div>

<p>Other reasons for rejection are marked change in choice of
the details chosen for commemoration, <i>e.g.</i> when Bābur mentions
prayer, he does so simply; when he tells a dream, it seems
a real one. The passage leaves the impression that the writer
did not think in Turkī, composed in it with difficulty, and
looked at life from another view-point than Bābur’s.</p>

<h2>[APPENDICES TO THE KĀBUL
SECTION.]</h2>

<h3><a name="e" id="e"></a>E.&mdash;NAGARAHĀR, AND NĪNG-NAHĀR</h3>

<p>Those who consult books and maps about the riverain tract
between the Safed-koh (Spīn-ghur) and (Anglicé) the Kābul-river
find its name in several forms, the most common being
Nangrahār and Nangnahār (with variant vowels). It would be
useful to establish a European book-name for the district. As
European opinion differs about the origin and meaning of the
names now in use, and as a good deal of interesting circumstance
gathers round the small problem of a correct form (there may be
two), I offer about the matter what has come into the restricted
field of my own work, premising that I do this merely as one
who drops a casual pebble on the cairn of observation already
long rising for scholarly examination.</p>

<p class="tb"><i>a. The origin and meaning of the names.</i></p>

<p>I have met with three opinions about the origin and meaning
of the names found now and earlier. To each one of them
obvious objection can be made. They are:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. That all forms now in use are corruptions of the Sanscrit
word Nagarahāra, the name of the Town-of-towns which in
the <i>dū-āb</i> of the Bārān-sū and Sūrkh-rūd left the ruins Masson
describes in Wilson’s <i>Ariana Antigua</i>. But if this is so, why
is the Town-of-towns multiplied into the nine of Na-nagrahār
(Nangrahār)?<a name="FNanchor_2773" id="FNanchor_2773"></a><a href="#Footnote_2773" class="fnanchor">2773</a></p>

<p>2. That the names found represent Sanscrit <i>nawā vihāra</i>,
nine monasteries, an opinion the Gazetteer of India of 1907 has
<span class='pagenum'><a name="a_xviii" id="a_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span>
adopted from Bellew. But why precisely nine monasteries?
Nine appears an understatement.</p>

<p>3. That Nang (Ning or Nung) -nahār verbally means nine
streams, (Bābur’s Tūqūz-rūd,) an interpretation of long
standing (Section <i>b infra</i>). But whence <i>nang</i>, <i>ning</i>, <i>nung</i>,
for nine? Such forms are not in Persian, Turkī or Pushtu
dictionaries, and, as Sir G. A. Grierson assures me, do not
come into the Linguistic Survey.</p></div>

<p class="tb"><i>b. On nang, ning, nung for nine.</i></p>

<p>Spite of their absence from the natural homes of words, however,
the above sounds have been heard and recorded as symbols
of the number nine by careful men through a long space of time.</p>

<p>The following instances of the use of “Nangnahār” show this,
and also show that behind the variant forms there may be not
a single word but two of distinct origin and sense.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. In Chinese annals two names appear as those of the
district and town (I am not able to allocate their application
with certainty). The first is Na-kie-lo-ho-lo, the second
Nang-g-lo-ho-lo and these, I understand to represent Nagara-hāra
and Nang-nahār, due allowance being made for Chinese
idiosyncrasy.<a name="FNanchor_2774" id="FNanchor_2774"></a><a href="#Footnote_2774" class="fnanchor">2774</a></p>

<p>2. Some 900 years later (1527-30 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>) Bābur also gives
two names, Nagarahār (as the book-name of his <i>tūmān</i>) and
Nīng-nahār.<a name="FNanchor_2775" id="FNanchor_2775"></a><a href="#Footnote_2775" class="fnanchor">2775</a> He says the first is found in several histories
(B.N. f. 131<i>b</i>); the second will have been what he heard and
also presumably what appeared in revenue accounts; of it he
says, “it is nine torrents” (<i>tūqūz-rūd</i>).</p>

<p>3. Some 300 years after Bābur, Elphinstone gives two
<span class='pagenum'><a name="a_xix" id="a_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span>names for the district, neither of them being Bābur’s book-name,
“Nangrahaur<a name="FNanchor_2776" id="FNanchor_2776"></a><a href="#Footnote_2776" class="fnanchor">2776</a> or Nungnahaur, from the nine streams
which issue from the Safed-koh, <i>nung</i> in Pushtoo signifying
<i>nine</i>, and <i>nahaura</i>, a stream” (<i>Caubul</i>, i, 160).</p>

<p>4. In 1881 Colonel H. S. Tanner had heard, in Nūr-valley
on the north side of the Kābul-water, that the name of the
opposite district was Nīng-nahār and its meaning Nine-streams.
He did not get a list of the nine and all he heard named do
not flow from Safed-koh.</p>

<p>5. In 1884 Colonel H. G. McGregor gives two names with
their explanation, “Ningrahar and Nungnihar; the former is
a corruption of the latter word<a name="FNanchor_2777" id="FNanchor_2777"></a><a href="#Footnote_2777" class="fnanchor">2777</a> which in the Afghān language
signifies nine rivers or rivulets.” He names nine, but of them
six only issue from Safed-koh.</p>

<p>6. I have come across the following instances in which the
number nine is represented by other words than <i>na</i> (<i>ni</i> or <i>nu</i>);
<i>viz.</i> the <i>nenhan</i> of the Chitrālī Kāfir and the <i>noun</i> of the Panjābi,
recorded by Leech,&mdash;the <i>nyon</i> of the Khowārī and the
<i>huncha</i> of the Boorishki, recorded by Colonel Biddulph.</p></div>

<p>The above instances allow opinion that in the region concerned
and through a long period of time, nine has been expressed by
<i>nang</i> (<i>ning</i> or <i>nung</i>) and other nasal or high palatal sounds, side
by side with <i>na</i> (<i>ni</i> or <i>nu</i>). The whole matter may be one of
nasal utterance,<a name="FNanchor_2778" id="FNanchor_2778"></a><a href="#Footnote_2778" class="fnanchor">2778</a> but since a large number of tribesmen express
nine by a word containing a nasal sound, should that word not
find place in lists of recognized symbols of sounds?</p>

<p class="tb"><i>c. Are there two names of distinct origin?</i></p>

<p>1. Certainly it makes a well-connected story of decay in the
Sanscrit word Nagarahāra to suppose that tribesmen, prone
by their organism to nasal utterance, pronounced that word
<span class='pagenum'><a name="a_xx" id="a_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span>Nangrahār, and by force of their numbers made this corruption
current,&mdash;that this was recognized as the name of the town while
the Town-of-towns was great or in men’s memory, and that when
through the decay of the town its name became a meaningless
husk, the wrong meaning of the Nine-streams should enter into
possession.</p>

<p>But as another and better one can be put together, this fair-seeming
story may be baseless. Its substitute has the advantage
of explaining the double sequence of names shown in Section <i>b</i>.</p>

<p>The second story makes all the variant names represent one
or other of two distinct originals. It leaves Nagrahār to represent
Nagarahāra, the dead town; it makes the nine torrents of Safed-koh
the primeval sponsors of Nīng-nahār, the name of the riverain
tract. Both names, it makes contemporary in the relatively brief
interlude of the life of the town. For the fertilizing streams will
have been the dominant factors of settlement and of revenue
from the earliest times of population and government. They
arrest the eye where they and their ribbons of cultivation space
the riverain waste; they are obvious units for grouping into
a sub-government. Their name has a counterpart in adjacent
Panj-āb; the two may have been given by one dominant power,
how long ago, in what tongue matters not. The riverain tract,
by virtue of its place on a highway of transit, must have been
inhabited long before the town Nagarahāra was built, and must
have been known by a name. What better one than Nine-streams
can be thought of?</p>

<p>2. Bellew is quoted by the Gazetteer of India (ed. 1907) as
saying, in his argument in favour of <i>nawā vihāra</i>, that no nine
streams are found to stand sponsor, but modern maps shew nine
outflows from Safed-koh to the Kābul-river between the Sūrkh-rūd
and Daka, while if affluents to the former stream be reckoned,
more than nine issue from the range.<a name="FNanchor_2779" id="FNanchor_2779"></a><a href="#Footnote_2779" class="fnanchor">2779</a></p>

<p>Against Bellew’s view that there are not nine streams, is the
long persistence of the number nine in the popular name
(Sect. <i>b</i>).</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="a_xxi" id="a_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span></p>
<p>It is also against his view that he supposes there were nine
monasteries, because each of the nine must have had its fertilizing
water.</p>

<p>Bābur says there were nine; there must have been nine of
significance; he knew his <i>tūmān</i> not only by frequent transit but
by his revenue accounts. A supporting point in those accounts
is likely to have been that the individual names of the villages on
the nine streams would appear, with each its payment of revenue.</p>

<p>3. In this also is some weight of circumstance against taking
Nagarahāra to be the parent of Nīng-nahār:&mdash;An earlier name
of the town is said to be Udyānapūra, Garden town.<a name="FNanchor_2780" id="FNanchor_2780"></a><a href="#Footnote_2780" class="fnanchor">2780</a> Of this
Bābur’s Adīnapūr is held to be a corruption; the same meaning
of garden has survived on approximately the same ground in
Bālā-bāgh and Roẓābād.</p>

<p>Nagarahāra is seen, therefore, to be a parenthetical name
between others which are all derived from gardens. It may
shew the promotion of a “Garden-town” to a “Chief-town”.
If it did this, there was relapse of name when the Chief-town
lost status. Was it ever applied beyond the delta? If it were,
would it, when dead in the delta, persist along the riverain tract?
If it were not, <i>cadit quæstio</i>; the suggestion of two names
distinct in origin, is upheld.</p>

<p>Certainly the riverain tract would fall naturally under the
government of any town flourishing in the delta, the richest and
most populous part of the region. But for this very reason it
must have had a name older than parenthetical Nagarahāra.
That inevitable name would be appropriately Nīng-nahār (or
Na-nahār) Nine-streams; and for a period Nagarahāra would be
the Chief-town of the district of Na-nahār (Nine-streams).<a name="FNanchor_2781" id="FNanchor_2781"></a><a href="#Footnote_2781" class="fnanchor">2781</a></p>

<p class="tb"><i>d. Bābur’s statements about the name.</i></p>

<p>What the cautious Bābur says of his <i>tūmān</i> of Nīng-nahār
has weight:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. That some histories write it Nagarahār (Ḥaidarābād
Codex, f. 131<i>b</i>);</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="a_xxii" id="a_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>2. That Nīng-nahār is nine torrents, <i>i.e.</i> mountain streams,
<i>tūquz-rud</i>;</p>

<p>3. That (the) nine torrents issue from Safed-koh (f. 132<i>b</i>).</p></div>

<p>Of his first statement can be said, that he will have seen the
book-name in histories he read, but will have heard Nīng-nahār,
probably also have seen it in current letters and accounts.</p>

<p>Of his second,&mdash;that it bears and may be meant to bear two
senses, (<i>a</i>) that the <i>tūmān</i> consisted of nine torrents,&mdash;their
lands implied; just as he says “Asfara is four <i>būlūks</i>” (sub-divisions
f. 3<i>b</i>)&mdash;(<i>b</i>) that <i>tūqūz rūd</i> translates <i>nīng-nahār</i>.</p>

<p>Of his third,&mdash;that in English its sense varies as it is read
with or without the definite article Turkī rarely writes, but that
either sense helps out his first and second, to mean that verbally
and by its constituent units Nīng-nahār is nine-torrents; as
verbally and by its constituents Panj-āb is five-waters.</p>

<p class="tb"><i>e. Last words.</i></p>

<p>Detailed work on the Kābul section of the <i>Bābur-nāma</i> has
stamped two impressions so deeply on me, that they claim
mention, not as novel or as special to myself, but as set by
the work.</p>

<p>The first is of extreme risk in swift decision on any problem
of words arising in North Afghānistān, because of its local
concourse of tongues, the varied utterance of its unlettered tribes
resident or nomad, and the frequent translation of proper names
in obedience to their verbal meanings. Names lie there too in
<i>strata</i>, relics of successive occupation&mdash;Greek, Turkī, Hindī,
Pushtū and tribes <i>galore</i>.</p>

<p>The second is that the region is an exceptionally fruitful field
for first-hand observation of speech, the movent ocean of the
uttered word, free of the desiccated symbolism of alphabets
and books.</p>

<h3><a name="f" id="f"></a>F.&mdash;ON THE NAME DARA-I-NŪR</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> European writers have understood the name Dara-i-nūr
to mean Valley of Light, but natural features and also the artificial
one mentioned by Colonel H. G. Tanner (<i>infra</i>), make it better
to read the component <i>nūr</i>, not as Persian <i>nūr</i>, light, but as
Pushtū <i>nūr</i>, rock. Hence it translates as Valley of Rocks, or
Rock-valley. The region in which the valley lies is rocky and
boulder-strewn; its own waters flow to the Kābul-river east of
the water of Chitrāl. It shews other names composed with <i>nūr</i>,
in which <i>nūr</i> suits if it means rock, but is inexplicable if it means
light, <i>e.g.</i> Nūr-lām (Nūr-fort), the master-fort in the mouth of
Nūr-valley, standing high on a rock between two streams, as
Bābur and Tanner have both described it from eye-witness,&mdash;Nūr-gal
(village), a little to the north-west of the valley,&mdash;Aūlūgh-nūr
(great rock), at a crossing mentioned by Bābur,
higher up the Bārān-water,&mdash;and Koh-i-nūr (Rocky-mountains),<span class='pagenum'><a name="a_xxiv" id="a_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</a></span>
which there is ground for taking as the correct form of the
familiar “Kunar” of some European writers (Raverty’s <i>Notes</i>,
p. 106). The dominant feature in these places dictates reading
<i>nūr</i> as rock; so too the work done in Nūr-valley with boulders,
of which Colonel H. G. Tanner’s interesting account is subjoined
(P.R.G.S. 1881, p. 284).</p>

<p>“Some 10 miles from the source of the main stream of the
Nur-valley the Dameneh stream enters, but the waters of the two
never meet; they flow side by side about three-quarters of a mile
apart for about 12 miles and empty themselves into the Kunar
river by different mouths, each torrent hugging closely the foot
of the hills at its own side of the valley. Now, except in countries
where terracing has been practised continuously for thousands of
years, such unnatural topography as exists in the valley of Nur
is next to impossible. The forces which were sufficient to scoop
out the valley in the first instance, would have kept a water-way
at the lowest part, into which would have poured the drainage of
the surrounding mountains; but in the Nur-valley long-continued
terracing has gradually raised the centre of the valley high above
the edges. The population has increased to its maximum limit
and every available inch of ground is required for cultivation;
the people, by means of terrace-walls built of ponderous boulders
in the bed of the original single stream, have little by little pushed
the waters out of their true course, until they run, where now
found, in deep rocky cuttings at the foot of the hills on either
side” (p. 280).</p>

<p>“I should like to go on and say a good deal more about
boulders; and while I am about it I may as well mention one
that lies back from a hamlet in Shulut, which is so big that
a house is built in a fault or crack running across its face.
Another pebble lies athwart the village and covers the whole of
the houses from that side.”<span class='pagenum'><a name="a_xxv" id="a_xxv">[Pg xxv]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="g" id="g"></a>G.&mdash;ON THE NAMES OF TWO DARA-I-NŪR
WINES.</h3>

<p>From the two names, Arat-tāshī and Sūhān (Suhār) -tāshī,
which Bābur gives as those of two wines of the Dara-i-nūr, it
can be inferred that he read <i>nūr</i> to mean rock. For if in them
Turkī <i>tāsh</i>, rock, be replaced by Pushtū <i>nūr</i>, rock, two place-names
emerge, Arat (-nūrī) and Sūhān (-nūrī), known in the
Nūr-valley.</p>

<p>These may be villages where the wines were grown, but it
would be quite exceptional for Bābur to say that wines are called
from their villages, or indeed by any name. He says here not
where they grow but what they are called.</p>

<p>I surmise that he is repeating a joke, perhaps his own, perhaps
a standing local one, made on the quality of the wines. For
whether with <i>tāsh</i> or with <i>nūr</i> (rock), the names can be translated
as Rock-saw and Rock-file, and may refer to the rough and acid
quality of the wines, rasping and setting the teeth on edge as
does iron on stone.</p>

<p>The villages themselves may owe their names to a serrated
edge or splintered pinnacle of weathered granite, in which local
people, known as good craftsmen, have seen resemblance to tools
of their trade.</p>

<h3><a name="h" id="h"></a>H.&mdash;ON THE COUNTERMARK BIH BŪD
ON COINS.</h3>

<p>As coins of Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā <i>Bāī-qarā</i> and other rulers do
actually bear the words <i>Bih būd</i>, Bābur’s statement that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="a_xxvi" id="a_xxvi">[Pg xxvi]</a></span>
name of Bihbūd Beg was on the Mīrzā’s coins acquires a
numismatic interest which may make serviceable the following

name was on the stamp and coin.<a name="FNanchor_2784" id="FNanchor_2784"></a><a href="#Footnote_2784" class="fnanchor">2784</a></p>

<p class="indent"><i>b. Of Bihbūd Beg.</i></p>

<p>We have found little so far to add to what Bābur tells of
Bihbūd Beg and what he tells we have not found elsewhere.
The likely sources of his information are Daulat Shāh and
Khwānd-amīr who have written at length of Ḥusain <i>Bāī-qarā</i>.
Considerable search in the books of both men has failed to
discover mention of signal service or public honour connected
with the beg. Bābur may have heard what he tells in Harāt
in 912 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (1506 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>) when he would see Ḥusain’s coins
<span class='pagenum'><a name="a_xxvii" id="a_xxvii">[Pg xxvii]</a></span>presumably; but later opportunity to see them must have been
frequent during his campaigns and visits north of Hindū-kush,
notably in Balkh.</p>

<p>The sole mention we have found of Bihbūd Beg in the
<i>Ḥabību’s-siyar</i> is that he was one of Ḥusain’s commanders at
the battle of Chīkmān-sarāī which was fought with Sl. Maḥmūd
Mīrzā <i>Mīrānshāhī</i> in Muḥarram 876 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (June-July 1471 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>).<a name="FNanchor_2785" id="FNanchor_2785"></a><a href="#Footnote_2785" class="fnanchor">2785</a>

<p>“‘Alī-darwesh of Khurāsān served in the Khurāsān <i>chuhra-jīrga-sī</i>,
one of two special corps (<i>khāṣa tābīn</i>) of serviceable
braves (<i>yārār yīgītlār</i>) formed by Sl. Abū-sa‘īd Mīrzā when
<span class='pagenum'><a name="a_xxviii" id="a_xxviii">[Pg xxviii]</a></span>he first began to arrange the government of Khurāsān and
Samarkand and, presumably, called by him the Khurāsān corps
and the Samarkand corps.”</p>

<p>This shews the circle to have consisted of fighting-men, such
serviceable braves as are frequently mentioned by Bābur; and
his words “<i>yārār yīgīt</i>” make it safe to say that if instead of
using a Persian phrase, he had used a Turkī one, <i>yīgīt</i>, brave
would have replaced <i>chuhra</i>, “young soldier” (Erskine). A considerable
number of men on active service are styled <i>chuhra</i>,
one at least is styled <i>yīgīt</i>, in the same way as others are
styled <i>beg</i>.<a name="FNanchor_2787" id="FNanchor_2787"></a><a href="#Footnote_2787" class="fnanchor">2787</a></p>

<p>Three military circles are mentioned in the <i>Bābur-nāma</i>,
consisting respectively of braves, household begs (under Bābur’s
own command), and great begs. Some men are mentioned who
never rose from the rank of brave (<i>yīgīt</i>), some who became
household-begs, some who went through the three grades.</p>

<p>Of the corps of braves Bābur conveys the information that
Abū-sa‘īd founded it at a date which will have lain between
1451 and 1457 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>; that ‘Umar Shaikh’s man ‘Alī-darwesh
belonged to it; and that Ḥusain’s man Bihbūd did so also.
Both men, ‘Ali-darwesh and Bihbūd, when in its circle, would
appropriately be styled <i>chuhra</i> as men of the beg-circle were
styled beg; the Dost-i-muḥammad <i>chuhra</i> who was a commander,
(he will have had a brave’s command,) at Chīkmān-sarāī
(<i>see</i> list <i>supra</i>) will also have been of this circle. Instances of the
use by Bābur of the name <i>khaṣa-tābīn</i> and its equivalent <i>būītīkīnī</i>
are shewn on f. 209 and f. 210<i>b</i>. A considerable number
of Bābur’s fighting men, the braves he so frequently mentions as
sent on service, are styled <i>chuhra</i> and inferentially belong to
the same circle.<a name="FNanchor_2788" id="FNanchor_2788"></a><a href="#Footnote_2788" class="fnanchor">2788</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="a_xxix" id="a_xxix">[Pg xxix]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent"><i>d. Of Bih būd on Ḥusain Bāī-qarā’s coins.</i></p>

<p>So far it does not seem safe to accept Bābur’s statement
literally. He may tell a half-truth and obscure the rest by his
brevity.</p>

<p>Nothing in the sources shows ground for signal and public
honour to Bihbūd Beg, but a good deal would allow surmise
that jesting allusion to his name might decide for <i>Bih būd</i> as
a coin mark when choice had to be made of one, in the flush of
success, in an assembly of the begs, and, amongst those begs,
lovers of word-play and enigma.</p>

<p>The personal name is found written Bihbūd, as one word and
with medial <i>h</i>; the mark is <i>Bih būd</i> with the terminal <i>h</i> in the
<i>Bih</i>. There have been discussions moreover as to whether to
read on the coins <i>Bih būd</i>, it was good, or <i>Bih buvad</i>, let it be,
or become, good (valid for currency?).</p>

<p>The question presents itself; would the beg’s name have
appeared on the coins, if it had not coincided in form with a
suitable coin-mark?</p>

<p>Against literal acceptance of Bābur’s statement there is also
doubt of a thing at once so <i>ben trovato</i> and so unsupported by
evidence.</p>

<p>Another doubt arises from finding <i>Bih būd</i> on coins of other
rulers, one of Iskandar Khān’s being of a later date,<a name="FNanchor_2789" id="FNanchor_2789"></a><a href="#Footnote_2789" class="fnanchor">2789</a> others, of
Tīmūr, Shāhrukh and Abū-sa‘īd, with nothing to shew who
counterstruck it on them.</p>

<p>On some of Ḥusain’s coins the sentence <i>Bih būd</i> appears as
part of the legend and not as a counterstrike. This is a good
basis for finding a half-truth in Bābur’s statement. It does not
allow of a whole-truth in his statement because, as it is written,
it is a coin-mark, not a name.</p>

<p>An interesting matter as bearing on Ḥusain’s use of <i>Bih būd</i>
is that in 865 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (1461 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>) he had an incomparable horse
named Bihbūd, one he gave in return for a falcon on making
peace with Mustapha Khān.<a name="FNanchor_2790" id="FNanchor_2790"></a><a href="#Footnote_2790" class="fnanchor">2790</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="a_xxx" id="a_xxx">[Pg xxx]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent"><i>e. Of Bābur’s vassal-coinage.</i></p>

<p>The following historical details narrow the field of numismatic
observation on coins believed struck by Bābur as a vassal of
Ismā‘īl <i>Ṣafawī</i>. They are offered because not readily accessible.</p>

<p>The length of Bābur’s second term of rule in Transoxiana
was not the three solar years of the B.M. Coin Catalogues but
did not exceed eight months. He entered Samarkand in the
middle of Rajab 917 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (<i>c.</i> Oct. 1st, 1511 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>). He returned
to it defeated and fled at once, after the battle of Kūl-i-malik
which was fought in Ṣafar 918 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (mid-April to mid-May
1512 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>). Previous to the entry he was in the field, without
a fixed base; after his flight he was landless till at the end
both of 920 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> and of 1514 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span> he had returned to Kābul.</p>

<p>He would not find a full Treasury in Samarkand because the
Aūzbegs evacuated the fort at their own time; eight months
would not give him large tribute in kind. He failed in Transoxiana
because he was the ally of a Shī‘a; would coins bearing
the Shī‘a legend have passed current from a Samarkand mint?
These various circumstances suggest that he could not have
struck many coins of any kind in Samarkand.</p>

<p>The coins classed in the B.M. Catalogues as of Bābur’s
vassalage, offer a point of difficulty to readers of his own
writings, inasmuch as neither the “Sult̤ān Muḥammad” of
No. 652 (gold), nor the “Sult̤ān Bābur Bahādur” of the silver
coins enables confident acceptance of them as names he himself
would use.</p>

<h3><a name="i" id="i"></a>I.&mdash;ON THE WEEPING-WILLOWS OF f. 190<i>b</i>.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> passage omitted from f. 190<i>b</i>, which seems to describe something
decorative done with weeping willows, (<i>bed-i-mawallah</i>)
has been difficult to all translators. This may be due to inaccurate
pointing in Bābur’s original MS. or may be what a
traveller seeing other willows at another feast could explain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="a_xxxi" id="a_xxxi">[Pg xxxi]</a></span></p>

<p>The first Persian translation omits the passage (I.O. 215
f. 154<i>b</i>); the second varies from the Turkī, notably by changing
<i>sāch</i> and <i>sāj</i> to <i>shākh</i> throughout (I.O. 217 f. 150<i>b</i>). The English
and French translations differ much (<i>Memoirs</i> p. 206, <i>Mémoires</i>
i, 414), the latter taking the <i>mawallah</i> to be <i>mūla</i>, a hut, against
which much is clear in the various MSS.</p>

<p>Three Turkī sources<a name="FNanchor_2791" id="FNanchor_2791"></a><a href="#Footnote_2791" class="fnanchor">2791</a> agree in reading as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mawallahlār-nī</i> (or <i>muwallah</i> Ḥai. MS.) <i>kīltūrdīlār. Bīlmān
sāchlārī-nīng yā ‘amlī sāchlārī-nīng ārālārīgha k:msān-nī</i>
(Ilminsky, <i>kamān</i>) <i>shākh-nīng</i> (Ḥai. MS. <i>șākh</i>) <i>aūzūnlūghī bīla
aīnjīga aīnjīga kīsīb, qūīūb tūrlār.</i></p>

<p>The English and French translations differ from the Turkī
and from one another:&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>Memoirs</i>, p. 206) They brought in branching willow-trees.
I do not know if they were in the natural state of the tree, or if
the branches were formed artificially, but they had small twigs
cut the length of the ears of a bow and inserted between them.</p>

<p>(<i>Mémoires</i> i, 434) On fa&ccedil;onna des huttes (<i>mouleh</i>). Ils les
établissent en taillant des baguettes minces, de la longeur du
bout recourbé de l’arc, qu’on place entre des branches naturelles
ou fa&ccedil;onnées artificiellement, je l’ignore.</p>

<p>The construction of the sentence appears to be thus:&mdash;<i>Mawal-lahlār-nī
kīltūrdīlār</i>, they brought weeping-willows; <i>k:msān-nī</i>
<i>qūīūbtūrlār</i>, they had put <i>k:msān-nī</i>; <i>aīnjīga aīnjīga kīsīb</i>,
cut very fine (or slender); <i>shākh</i> (or <i>șākh</i>)<i>-nīng aūzūnlūghī</i>, of the
length of a <i>shākh</i>, bow, or <i>șākh</i> ...; <i>bīlmān sāchlārī-nīng yā ‘amlī
sāchlārī-nīng ārālārīgha</i>, to (or at) the spaces of the <i>sāchlār</i>
whether their (<i>i.e.</i> the willows') own or artificial <i>sāchlār</i>.</p>

<p>These translations clearly indicate felt difficulty. Mr. Erskine
does not seem to have understood that the trees were <i>Salix
babylonica</i>. The crux of the passage is the word <i>k:msān-nī</i>,
which tells what was placed in the spaces. It has been read as
<i>kamān</i>, bow, by all but the scribes of the two good Turkī MSS.
and as in a phrase <i>horn of a bow</i>. This however is not allowed
by the Turkī, for the reason that <i>k:msān-nī</i> is not in the genitive
but in the accusative case. (I may say that Bābur does not use
<i>nī</i> for <i>nīng</i>; he keeps strictly to the prime uses of each enclitic,</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="a_xxxii" id="a_xxxii">[Pg xxxii]</a></span></p>
<p><i>nī</i> accusative, <i>nīng</i> genitive.) Moreover, if <i>k:msān-nī</i> be taken
as a genitive, the verbs <i>qūīūb-tūrlār</i> and <i>kīsīb</i> have no object, no
other accusative appearing in the sentence than <i>k:msān-nī</i>.</p>

<p>A weighty reason against changing <i>sāch</i> into <i>shākh</i> is that
Dr. Ilminsky has not done so. He must have attached meaning
to <i>sāch</i> since he uses it throughout the passage. He was nearer
the region wherein the original willows were seen at a feast.
Unfortunately nothing shows how he interpreted the word.</p>

<p><i>Sāchmāq</i> is a tassel; is it also a catkin and were there
decorations, <i>kimsān-nī</i> (things <i>kimsa</i>, or flowers Ar. <i>kim</i>, or
something shining, <i>kimcha</i>, gold brocade) hung in between the
catkins?</p>

<p>Ilminsky writes <i>mu’lah</i> (with <i>ḥamza</i>) and this de Courteille
translates by hut. The Ḥai. MS. writes <i>muwallah</i> (marking
the <i>ẓamma</i>).</p>

<p>In favour of reading <i>mawallah</i> (<i>mulah</i>) as a tree and that tree
<i>Salix babylonica</i> the weeping-willow, there are annotations in the
Second Persian translation and, perhaps following it, in the
Elphinstone MS. of <i>nām-i-dirakht</i>, name of a tree, <i>dīdān-i-bed</i>,
sight of the willow, <i>bed-i-mawallah</i>, mournful-willow. Standing
alone <i>mawallah</i> means weeping-willow, in this use answering to
<i>majnūn</i> the name Panj-ābīs give the tree, from Leila’s lover the
distracted <i>i.e.</i> Majnūn (Brandis).</p>

<p>The whole question may be solved by a chance remark from
a traveller witnessing similar festive decoration at another feast
in that conservative region.</p>

<h3><a name="j" id="j"></a>J.&mdash;ON BĀBUR’S EXCAVATED CHAMBER
AT QANDAHĀR (f. 208<i>b</i>).</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Since</span> making my note (f. 208<i>b</i>) on the wording of the passage
in which Bābur mentions excavation done by him at Qandahār,
I have learned that he must be speaking of the vaulted chamber
<span class='pagenum'><a name="a_xxxiii" id="a_xxxiii">[Pg xxxiii]</a></span>
containing the celebrated inscriptions about which much has
been written.<a name="FNanchor_2792" id="FNanchor_2792"></a><a href="#Footnote_2792" class="fnanchor">2792</a></p>

<p>The primary inscription, the one commemorating Bābur’s
final possession of Qandahār, gives the chamber the character of
a Temple of Victory and speaks of it as <i>Rawāq-i-jahān namāī</i>,
World-shewing-portal,<a name="FNanchor_2793" id="FNanchor_2793"></a><a href="#Footnote_2793" class="fnanchor">2793</a> doubtless because of its conspicuous
position and its extensive view, probably also in allusion to its
declaration of victory. Mīr Ma‘ṣūm writes of it as a Pesh-t̤āq,
frontal arch, which, coupled with Mohan Lall’s word arch (<i>t̤āq</i>)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">suggests that the chamber was entered through an arch pierced</span><br />
in a parallelogram smoothed on the rock and having resemblance
to the <i>pesh-tāq</i> of buildings, a suggestion seeming the more
probable that some inscriptions are on the “wings” of the arch.
But by neither of the above-mentioned names do Mohan Lall
and later travellers call the chamber or write of the place; all
describe it by its approach of forty steps, Chihil-zīna.<a name="FNanchor_2794" id="FNanchor_2794"></a><a href="#Footnote_2794" class="fnanchor">2794</a></p>

<p>The excavation has been chipped out of the white-veined
limestone of the bare ridge on and below which stood Old
Qandahār.<a href="#Footnote_2794" class="fnanchor">2794</a> It does not appear from the descriptions to have
been on the summit of the ridge; Bellew says that the forty
steps start half-way up the height. I have found no estimate
of the height of the ridge, or statement that the steps end at the
chamber. The ridge however seems to have been of noticeably
dominating height. It rises steeply to the north and there ends
in the naze of which Bābur writes. The foot of the steps is
guarded by two towers. Mohan Lall, unaccustomed to mountains,
found their ascent steep and dizzy. The excavated chamber of
the inscriptions, which Bellew describes as “bow-shaped and
dome-roofed”, he estimated as 12 feet at the highest point,</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="a_xxxiv" id="a_xxxiv">[Pg xxxiv]</a></span></p>

<p>12 feet deep and 8 feet wide. Two sculptured beasts guard the
entrance; Bellew calls them leopards but tigers would better
symbolize the watch and ward of the Tiger Bābur. In truth
the whole work, weary steps of approach, tiger guardians, commemorative
chamber, laboriously incised words, are admirably
symbolic of his long-sustained resolve and action, taken always
with Hindūstān as the goal.</p>

<p>There are several inscriptions of varying date, within and
without the chamber. Mohan Lall saw and copied them;
Darmesteter worked on a copy; the two English observers
Lumsden and Bellew made no attempt at correct interpretation.
In the versions all give there are inaccuracies, arising from
obvious causes, especially from want of historical <i>data</i>. The last
word has not been said; revision awaits photography and the
leisured expert. A part of the needed revision has been done
by Beames, who deals with the geography of what Mīr Ma‘ṣūm
himself added under Akbar after he had gone as Governor to
Qandahār in 1007 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (1598 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>). This commemorates not
Bābur’s but Akbar’s century of cities.</p>

<p>It is the primary inscription only which concerns this Appendix.
This is one in relief in the dome of the chamber, recording in
florid Persian that Abū’l-ghāzī Bābur took possession of Qandahār
on Shawwāl 13th 928 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (Sep. 1st 1522 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>), that in the same
year he commanded the construction of this <i>Rawāq-i-jahān-namāī</i>,
and that the work had been completed by his son Kāmrān
at the time he made over charge of Qandahār to his brother
‘Askarī in 9 ... (mutilated). After this the gravure changes in
character.</p>

<p>In the above, Bābur’s title Abū’l-ghāzī fixes the date of the
inscription as later than the battle of Kanwāha (f. 324<i>b</i>), because
it was assumed in consequence of this victory over a Hindū, in
March 1527 (Jumāda II 933 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>).</p>

<p>The mutilated date 9 ... is given by Mohan Lall as 952 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>
but this does not suit several circumstances, <i>e.g.</i> it puts completion
too far beyond the time mentioned as consumed by the
work, nine years,&mdash;and it was not that at which Kāmrān made
over charge to ‘Askarī, but followed the expulsion of both full-brothers
from Qandahār by their half-brother Humāyūn.<span class='pagenum'><a name="a_xxxv" id="a_xxxv">[Pg xxxv]</a></span></p>

<p>The mutilated date 9 ... is given by Darmesteter as 933 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>
but this again does not fit the historical circumstance that
Kāmrān was in Qandahār after that date and till 937 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> This
date (937 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>) we suggest as fitting to replace the lost figures,
(1) because in that year and after his father’s death, Kāmrān
gave the town to ‘Askarī and went himself to Hindūstān, and
(2) because work begun in 928 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> and recorded as occupying
70-80 men for nine years would be complete in 937 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span><a name="FNanchor_2795" id="FNanchor_2795"></a><a href="#Footnote_2795" class="fnanchor">2795</a> The
inscription would be one of the last items of the work.</p>

<hr />

<p>The following matters are added here because indirectly connected
with what has been said and because not readily accessible.</p>

<p><i>a. Birth of Kāmrān.</i></p>

<p>Kāmrān’s birth falling in a year of one of the <i>Bābur-nāma</i>
gaps, is nowhere mentioned. It can be closely inferred as 914
or 915 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> from the circumstances that he was younger than
Humāyūn born late in 913 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>, that it is not mentioned in the
fragment of the annals of 914 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>, and that he was one of the
children enumerated by Gul-badan as going with her father to
Samarkand in 916 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (Probably the children did not start
with their father in the depth of winter across the mountains.)
Possibly the joyful name Kāmrān is linked to the happy issue
of the Mughūl rebellion of 914 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> Kāmrān would thus be
about 18 when left in charge of Kābul and Qandahār by Bābur
in 932 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> before the start for the fifth expedition to Hindūstān.</p>

<p>A letter from Bābur to Kāmrān in Qandahār is with Kehr’s
Latin version of the <i>Bābur-nāma</i>, in Latin and entered on the
lining of the cover. It is shewn by its main topic <i>viz.</i> the
despatch of Ibrāhīm <i>Lūdī</i>’s son to Kāmrān’s charge, to date
somewhere close to Jan. 3rd 1527 (Rabī‘u’l-awwal 29th 933 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>)
because on that day Bābur writes of the despatch (Ḥai. Codex
f. 306<i>b</i> foot).</p>

<p>Presumably the letter was with Kāmrān’s own copy of the
<i>Bābur-nāma</i>. That copy may have reached Humāyūn’s hands</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="a_xxxvi" id="a_xxxvi">[Pg xxxvi]</a></span></p>
<p>(JRAS 1908 p. 828 <i>et seq.</i>). The next known indication of the
letter is given in St. Petersburg by Dr. Kehr. He will have seen
it or a copy of it with the B.N. Codex he copied (one of unequaled
correctness), and he, no doubt, copied it in its place on the fly-leaf
or board of his own transcript, but if so, it has disappeared.</p>

<p>Fuller particulars of it and of other items accompanying it are
given in JRAS 1908 p. 828 <i>et seq.</i></p>

<h3><a name="k" id="k"></a>K.&mdash;AN AFGHĀN LEGEND.</h3>

<p>My husband’s article in the Asiatic Quarterly Review of
April 1901 begins with an account of the two MSS. from which
it is drawn, <i>viz.</i> I.O. 581 in Pushtū, I.O. 582 in Persian. Both
are mainly occupied with an account of the Yūsuf-zāī. The
second opens by telling of the power of the tribe in Afghānistān
and of the kindness of Malik Shāh Sulaimān, one of their chiefs,
to Aūlūgh Beg Mīrzā <i>Kābulī</i>, (Bābur’s paternal uncle,) when he
was young and in trouble, presumably as a boy ruler.</p>

<p>It relates that one day a wise man of the tribe, Shaikh
‘Us̤mān saw Sulaimān sitting with the young Mīrzā on his knee
and warned him that the boy had the eyes of Yazīd and would
destroy him and his family as Yazīd had destroyed that of the
Prophet. Sulaimān paid him no attention and gave the Mīrzā
his daughter in marriage. Subsequently the Mīrzā having
invited the Yūsuf-zāī to Kābul, treacherously killed Sulaimān
and 700 of his followers. They were killed at the place called
Siyāh-sang near Kābul; it is still known, writes the chronicler
in about 1770 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span> (1184 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>), as the Grave of the Martyrs.
Their tombs are revered and that of Shaikh ‘Us̤mān in
particular.</p>

<p>Shāh Sulaimān was the eldest of the seven sons of Malik
Tāju’d-dīn; the second was Sult̤ān Shāh, the father of Malik
Aḥmad. Before Sulaimān was killed he made three requests
<span class='pagenum'><a name="a_xxxvii" id="a_xxxvii">[Pg xxxvii]</a></span>
of Aūlūgh Beg; one of them was that his nephew Aḥmad’s
life might be spared. This was granted.</p>

<p>Aūlūgh Beg died (after ruling from 865 to 907 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>), and
Bābur defeated his son-in-law and successor M. Muqīm (<i>Arghūn</i>,
910 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>). Meantime the Yūsuf-zāī had migrated to Pashāwar
but later on took Sawād from Sl. Wais (Ḥai. Codex ff. 219,
220<i>b</i>, 221).</p>

<p>When Bābur came to rule in Kābul, he at first professed
friendship for the Yūsuf-zāī but became prejudiced against
them through their enemies the Dilazāk<a name="FNanchor_2796" id="FNanchor_2796"></a><a href="#Footnote_2796" class="fnanchor">2796</a> who gave force to
their charges by a promised subsidy of 70,000 <i>shāhrukhī</i>.
Bābur therefore determined, says the Yūsuf-zāī chronicler, to
kill Malik<a name="FNanchor_2797" id="FNanchor_2797"></a><a href="#Footnote_2797" class="fnanchor">2797</a> Aḥmad and so wrote him a friendly invitation to
Kābul. Aḥmad agreed to go, and set out with four brothers
who were famous musicians. Meanwhile the Dilazāk had
persuaded Bābur to put Aḥmad to death at once, for they said
Aḥmad was so clever and eloquent that if allowed to speak, he
would induce the Pādshāh to pardon him.</p>

<p>On Aḥmad’s arrival in Kābul, he is said to have learned that
Bābur’s real object was his death. His companions wanted to
tie their turbans together and let him down over the wall of the
fort, but he rejected their proposal as too dangerous for him and
them, and resolved to await his fate. He told his companions
however, except one of the musicians, to go into hiding in
the town.</p>

<p>Next morning there was a great assembly and Bābur sat on
the da&iuml;s-throne. Aḥmad made his reverence on entering but
Bābur’s only acknowledgment was to make bow and arrow
ready to shoot him. When Aḥmad saw that Bābur’s intention
was to shoot him down without allowing him to speak, he
unbuttoned his jerkin and stood still before the Pādshāh.
Bābur, astonished, relaxed the tension of his bow and asked
Aḥmad what he meant. Aḥmad’s only reply was to tell the
Pādshāh not to question him but to do what he intended.
Bābur again asked his meaning and again got the same reply.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="a_xxxviii" id="a_xxxviii">[Pg xxxviii]</a></span></p><p>Bābur put the same question a third time, adding that he could
not dispose of the matter without knowing more. Then Aḥmad
opened the mouth of praise, expatiated on Bābur’s excellencies
and said that in this great assemblage many of his subjects
were looking on to see the shooting; that his jerkin being very
thick, the arrow might not pierce it; the shot might fail and
the spectators blame the Pādshāh for missing his mark; for
these reasons he had thought it best to bare his breast. Bābur
was so pleased by this reply that he resolved to pardon Aḥmad
at once, and laid down his bow.</p>

<p>Said he to Aḥmad, “What sort of man is Buhlūl <i>Lūdī</i>?”
“A giver of horses,” said Aḥmad.</p>

<p>“And of what sort his son Sikandar?” “A giver of robes.”</p>

<p>“And of what sort is Bābur?” “He,” said Aḥmad, “is
a giver of heads.”</p>

<p>“Then,” rejoined Bābur, “I give you yours.”</p>

<p>The Pādshāh now became quite friendly with Aḥmad, came
down from his throne, took him by the hand and led him into
another room where they drank together. Three times did
Bābur have his cup filled, and after drinking a portion, give the
rest to Aḥmad. At length the wine mounted to Bābur’s head;
he grew merry and began to dance. Meantime Aḥmad’s
musician played and Aḥmad who knew Persian well, poured
out an eloquent harangue. When Bābur had danced for some
time, he held out his hands to Aḥmad for a reward (<i>bakhshīsh</i>),
saying, “I am your performer.” Three times did he open his
hands, and thrice did Aḥmad, with a profound reverence, drop
a gold coin into them. Bābur took the coins, each time placing
his hand on his head. He then took off his robe and gave it to
Aḥmad; Aḥmad took off his own coat, gave it to Adu the
musician, and put on what the Pādshāh had given.</p>

<p>Aḥmad returned safe to his tribe. He declined a second
invitation to Kābul, and sent in his stead his brother Shāh
Manṣūr. Manṣūr received speedy dismissal as Bābur was displeased
at Aḥmad’s not coming. On his return to his tribe
Manṣūr advised them to retire to the mountains and make
a strong <i>sangur</i>. This they did; as foretold, Bābur came into
their country with a large army. He devastated their lands<span class='pagenum'><a name="a_xxxix" id="a_xxxix">[Pg xxxix]</a></span>
but could make no impression on their fort. In order the
better to judge of its character, he, as was his wont, disguised
himself as a Qalandar, and went with friends one dark night to
the Mahūra hill where the stronghold was, a day’s journey
from the Pādshāh’s camp at Dīārūn.</p>

<p>It was the ‘Īd-i-qurbān and there was a great assembly and
feasting at Shāh Manṣūr’s house, at the back of the Mahūra-mountain,
still known as Shāh Manṣūr’s throne. Bābur went
in his disguise to the back of the house and stood among the
crowd in the courtyard. He asked servants as they went to
and fro about Shāh Manṣūr’s family and whether he had
a daughter. They gave him straightforward answers.</p>

<p>At the time Musammat Bībī Mubāraka, Shāh Manṣur’s
daughter was sitting with other women in a tent. Her eye fell
on the qalandars and she sent a servant to Bābur with some
cooked meat folded between two loaves. Bābur asked who had
sent it; the servant said it was Shāh Manṣūr’s daughter Bībī
Mubāraka. “Where is she?” “That is she, sitting in front
of you in the tent.” Bābur Pādshāh became entranced with
her beauty and asked the woman-servant, what was her disposition
and her age and whether she was betrothed. The
servant replied by extolling her mistress, saying that her virtue
equalled her beauty, that she was pious and brimful of rectitude
and placidity; also that she was not betrothed. Bābur then
left with his friends, and behind the house hid between two
stones the food that had been sent to him.</p>

<p>He returned to camp in perplexity as to what to do; he saw
he could not take the fort; he was ashamed to return to Kābul
with nothing effected; moreover he was in the fetters of love.
He therefore wrote in friendly fashion to Malik Aḥmad and
asked for the daughter of Shāh Manṣūr, son of Shāh Sulaimān.
Great objection was made and earlier misfortunes accruing to
Yūsuf-zāī chiefs who had given daughters to Aūlūgh Beg and
Sl. Wais (Khān Mīrzā?) were quoted. They even said they
had no daughter to give. Bābur replied with a “beautiful”
royal letter, told of his visit disguised to Shāh Manṣūr’s house,
of his seeing Bībī Mubāraka and as token of the truth of his
story, asked them to search for the food he had hidden. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="a_xl" id="a_xl">[Pg xl]</a></span>
searched and found. Aḥmad and Manṣūr were still averse, but
the tribesmen urged that as before they had always made
sacrifice for the tribe so should they do now, for by giving the
daughter in marriage, they would save the tribe from Bābur’s
anger. The Maliks then said that it should be done “for the
good of the tribe”.</p>

<p>When their consent was made known to Bābur, the drums of
joy were beaten and preparations were made for the marriage;
presents were sent to the bride, a sword of his also, and the two
Maliks started out to escort her. They are said to have come
from Thana by M‘amūra (?), crossed the river at Chakdara,
taken a narrow road between two hills and past Talāsh-village
to the back of Tīrī (?) where the Pādshāh’s escort met them.
The Maliks returned, spent one night at Chakdara and next
morning reached their homes at the Mahūra <i>sangur</i>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Runa the nurse who had control of Malik Manṣūr’s
household, with two other nurses and many male and female
servants, went on with Bībī Mubāraka to the royal camp. The
bride was set down with all honour at a large tent in the middle
of the camp.</p>

<p>That night and on the following day the wives of the officers
came to visit her but she paid them no attention. So, they
said to one another as they were returning to their tents, “Her
beauty is beyond question, but she has shewn us no kindness,
and has not spoken to us; we do not know what mystery there
is about her.”</p>

<p>Now Bībī Mubāraka had charged her servants to let her know
when the Pādshāh was approaching in order that she might
receive him according to Malik Aḥmad’s instructions. They
said to her, “That was the pomp just now of the Pādshāh’s going
to prayers at the general mosque.” That same day after the
Mid-day Prayer, the Pādshāh went towards her tent. Her
servants informed her, she immediately left her divan and
advancing, lighted up the carpet by her presence, and stood
respectfully with folded hands. When the Pādshāh entered, she
bowed herself before him. But her face remained entirely
covered. At length the Pādshāh seated himself on the divan
and said to her, “Come Afghāniya, be seated.” Again she<span class='pagenum'><a name="a_xli" id="a_xli">[Pg xli]</a></span>
bowed before him, and stood as before. A second time he said,
“Afghāniya, be seated.” Again she prostrated herself before
him and came a little nearer, but still stood. Then the Pādshāh
pulled the veil from her face and beheld incomparable beauty.
He was entranced, he said again, “O, Afghāniya, sit down.”
Then she bowed herself again, and said, “I have a petition to
make. If an order be given, I will make it.” The Pādshāh
said kindly, “Speak.” Whereupon she with both hands took
up her dress and said, “Think that the whole Yūsuf-zāī tribe is
enfolded in my skirt, and pardon their offences for my sake.”
Said the Pādshāh, “I forgive the Yūsuf-zāī all their offences in
thy presence, and cast them all into thy skirt. Hereafter I shall
have no ill-feeling to the Yūsuf-zāī.” Again she bowed before
him; the Pādshāh took her hand and led her to the divan.</p>

<p>When the Afternoon Prayer time came and the Pādshāh rose
from the divan to go to prayers, Bībī Mubāraka jumped up and
fetched him his shoes.<a name="FNanchor_2798" id="FNanchor_2798"></a><a href="#Footnote_2798" class="fnanchor">2798</a> He put them on and said very pleasantly,
“I am extremely pleased with you and your tribe and I have
pardoned them all for your sake.” Then he said with a smile,
“We know it was Malik Aḥmad taught you all these ways.”
He then went to prayers and the Bībī remained to say hers in
the tent.</p>

<p>After some days the camp moved from Dīārūn and proceeded
by Bajaur and Tankī to Kābul.<a name="FNanchor_2799" id="FNanchor_2799"></a><a href="#Footnote_2799" class="fnanchor">2799</a>...</p>

<p>Bībī Mubāraka, the Blessed Lady, is often mentioned by
Gul-badan; she had no children; and lived an honoured life,
as her chronicler says, until the beginning of Akbar’s reign,
when she died. Her brother Mīr Jamāl rose to honour under
Bābur, Humāyūn and Akbar.</p>

<h3><a name="l" id="l"></a>L.&mdash;ON MĀHĪM’S ADOPTION OF HIND-ĀL.</h3>

<p>The passage quoted below about Māhīm’s adoption of the
unborn Hind-āl we have found so far only in Kehr’s transcript
of the <i>Bābur-nāma</i> (<i>i.e.</i> the St. Petersburg Foreign Office Codex).
Ilminsky reproduced it (Kāsān imprint p. 281) and de Courteille
translated it (ii, 45), both with endeavour at emendation. It is
interpolated in Kehr’s MS. at the wrong place, thus indicating
that it was once marginal or apart from the text.</p>

<p>I incline to suppose the whole a note made by Humāyūn,
although part of it might be an explanation made by Bābur, at
a later date, of an over-brief passage in his diary. Of such
passages there are several instances. What is strongly against
its being Bābur’s where otherwise it might be his, is that Māhīm,
as he always calls her simply, is there written of as Ḥaẓrat
Wālida, Royal Mother and with the honorific plural. That
plural Bābur uses for his own mother (dead 14 years before
925 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>) and never for Māhīm. The note is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The explanation is this:&mdash;As up to that time those of one
birth (<i>tūqqān</i>, womb) with him (Humāyūn), that is to say a son
Bār-būl, who was younger than he but older than the rest, and
three daughters, Mihr-jān and two others, died in childhood, he
had a great wish for one of the same birth with him.<a name="FNanchor_2800" id="FNanchor_2800"></a><a href="#Footnote_2800" class="fnanchor">2800</a> I had
said ‘What it would have been if there had been one of the
same birth with him!’ (Humāyūn). Said the Royal Mother,
‘If Dil-dār Āghācha bear a son, how is it if I take him and rear
him?’ ‘It is very good’ said I.”</p>

<p>So far doubtfully <i>might</i> be Bābur’s but it may be Humāyūn’s
written as a note for Bābur. What follows appears to be by
some-one who knew the details of Māhīm’s household talk and
was in Kābul when Dil-dār’s child was taken from her.</p>

<p>“Seemingly women have the custom of taking omens in the
following way:&mdash;When they have said, ‘Is it to be a boy? is it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="a_xliii" id="a_xliii">[Pg xliii]</a></span>
to be a girl?’ they write ‘Alī or Ḥasan on one of two pieces of
paper and Fāt̤ima on the other, put each paper into a ball of
clay and throw both into a bowl of water. Whichever opens
first is taken as an omen; if the man’s, they say a man-child
will be born; if the woman’s, a girl will be born. They took
the omen; it came out a man.”</p>

<p>“On this glad tidings we at once sent letters off.<a name="FNanchor_2801" id="FNanchor_2801"></a><a href="#Footnote_2801" class="fnanchor">2801</a> A few
days later God’s mercy bestowed a son. Three days before the
news<a name="FNanchor_2802" id="FNanchor_2802"></a><a href="#Footnote_2802" class="fnanchor">2802</a> and three days after the birth, they<a name="FNanchor_2803" id="FNanchor_2803"></a><a href="#Footnote_2803" class="fnanchor">2803</a> took the child from
its mother, (she) willy-nilly, brought it to our house<a name="FNanchor_2804" id="FNanchor_2804"></a><a href="#Footnote_2804" class="fnanchor">2804</a> and took
it in their charge. When we sent the news of the birth, Bhīra
was being taken. They named him Hind-āl for a good omen
and benediction.”<a name="FNanchor_2805" id="FNanchor_2805"></a><a href="#Footnote_2805" class="fnanchor">2805</a></p>

<p>The whole may be Humāyūn’s, and prompted by a wish to
remove an obscurity his father had left and by sentiment stirred
through reminiscence of a cherished childhood.</p>

<p>Whether Humāyūn wrote the whole or not, how is it that the
passage appears only in the Russian group of Bāburiana?</p>

<p>An apparent answer to this lies in the following little mosaic
of circumstances:&mdash;The St. Petersburg group of Bāburiana<a name="FNanchor_2806" id="FNanchor_2806"></a><a href="#Footnote_2806" class="fnanchor">2806</a> is
linked to Kāmrān’s own copy of the <i>Bābur-nāma</i> by having
with it a letter of Bābur to Kāmrān and also what <i>may be</i> a note
indicating its passage into Humāyūn’s hands (JRAS 1908
p. 830). If it did so pass, a note by Humāyūn may have become
associated with it, in one of several obvious ways. This would
be at a date earlier than that of the Elphinstone MS. and would
explain why it is found in Russia and not in Indian MSS.<a name="FNanchor_2807" id="FNanchor_2807"></a><a href="#Footnote_2807" class="fnanchor">2807</a></p>

<h2>[APPENDICES TO THE HINDŪSTĀN
SECTION.]</h2>

<h3><a name="m" id="m"></a>M.&mdash;ON THE TERM <i>BAḤRĪ QŪT̤ĀS</i>.</h3>

<p>That the term <i>baḥrī qūt̤ās</i> is interpreted by Meninski, Erskine,
and de Courteille in senses so widely differing as <i>equus maritimus</i>,
mountain-cow, and <i>bœuf vert de mer</i> is due, no doubt, to
their writing when the <i>qūt̤ās</i>, the yāk, was less well known than
it now is.</p>

<p>The word <i>qūt̤ās</i> represents both the yāk itself and its neck-tassel
and tail. Hence Meninski explains it by <i>nodus fimbriatus
ex cauda seu crinibus equi maritimi</i>. His “sea-horse”
appears to render <i>baḥrī qūt̤ās</i>, and is explicable by the circumstance
that the same purposes are served by horse-tails and by
yāk-tails and tassels, namely, with both, standards are fashioned,
horse-equipage is ornamented or perhaps furnished with fly-flappers,
and the ordinary hand-fly-flappers are made, <i>i.e.</i> the
<i>chowries</i> of Anglo-India.</p>

<p>Erskine’s “mountain-cow” (<i>Memoirs</i> p. 317) may well be due
to his <i>munshī’s</i> giving the yāk an alternative name, <i>viz.</i> <i>Kosh-gau</i>
(Vigne) or <i>Khāsh-gau</i> (Ney Elias), which appears to mean
mountain-cow (cattle, oxen).<a name="FNanchor_2808" id="FNanchor_2808"></a><a href="#Footnote_2808" class="fnanchor">2808</a></p>

<p>De Courteille’s <i>Dictionary</i> p. 422, explains <i>qūtās</i> (<i>qūt̤ās</i>) as <i>bœuf
marin</i> (<i>baḥrī qūt̤ās</i>) and his <i>Mémoires</i> ii, 191, renders Bābur’s
<i>baḥrī qūt̤ās</i> by <i>bœuf vert de mer</i> (f. 276, p. 490 and n. 8).</p>

<p>The term <i>baḥrī qūt̤ās</i> could be interpreted with more confidence
if one knew where the seemingly Arabic-Turkī compound
originated.<a name="FNanchor_2809" id="FNanchor_2809"></a><a href="#Footnote_2809" class="fnanchor">2809</a> Bābur uses it in Hindūstān where the neck-tassel
<span class='pagenum'><a name="a_xlvi" id="a_xlvi">[Pg xlvi]</a></span>and the tail of the domestic yāk are articles of commerce, and
where, as also probably in Kābul, he will have known of the
same class of yāk as a saddle-animal and as a beast of burden into
Kashmīr and other border-lands of sufficient altitude to allow
its survival. A part of its wide Central Asian habitat abutting
on Kashmīr is Little Tibet, through which flows the upper Indus
and in which tame yāk are largely bred, Skardo being a place
specially mentioned by travellers as having them plentifully.
This suggests that the term <i>baḥrī qūt̤ās</i> is due to the great
river (<i>baḥr</i>) and that those of which Bābur wrote in Hindūstān
were from Little Tibet and its great river. But <i>baḥrī</i> may
apply to another region where also the domestic yāk abounds,
that of the great lakes, inland seas such as Pangong, whence the
yāk comes and goes between <i>e.g.</i> Yārkand and the Hindūstān
border.</p>

<p>The second suggestion, <i>viz.</i> that “<i>baḥrī qūt̤ās</i>” refers to the
habitat of the domestic yāk in lake and marsh lands of high
altitude (the wild yāk also but, as Tibetan, it is less likely to be
concerned here) has support in Dozy’s account of the <i>baḥrī</i>
falcon, a bird mentioned also by Abū’l-faẓl amongst sporting
birds (<i>Āyīn-i-akbarī</i>, Blochmann’s trs. p. 295):&mdash;“<i>Baḥrī, esp&egrave;ce
de faucon le meilleur pour les oiseaux de marais. Ce renseignment
explique peut-&ecirc;tre l’origine du mot. Marguerite en donne
la m&ecirc;me etymologie que Tashmend et le P&egrave;re Guagix. Selon lui
ce faucon aurait été appelé ainsi parce qu’il vient de l’autre c&ocirc;té
de la mer, mais peut-&ecirc;tre dériva-t-il de baḥrī dans le sens de
marais, flaque, étang.</i>”</p>

<p>Dr. E. Denison Ross’ <i>Polyglot List of Birds</i> (<i>Memoirs of the
Asiatic Society of Bengal</i> ii, 289) gives to the <i>Qarā Qīrghāwal</i>
(Black pheasant) the synonym “Sea-pheasant”, this being the
literal translation of its Chinese name, and quotes from the
Manchū-Chinese “Mirror” the remark that this is a black
pheasant but called “sea-pheasant” to distinguish it from other
black ones.</p>

<p>It may be observed that Bābur writes of the yāk once only
and then of the <i>baḥrī qūt̤ās</i> so that there is no warrant from him
for taking the term to apply to the wild yāk. His cousin and<span class='pagenum'><a name="a_xlvii" id="a_xlvii">[Pg xlvii]</a></span>
contemporary Ḥaidar Mīrzā, however, mentions the wild yāk
twice and simply as the wild <i>qūt̤ās</i>.</p>

<p>The following are random gleanings about “<i>baḥrī</i>” and
the yāk:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) An instance of the use of the Persian equivalent <i>daryā’ī</i>
of <i>baḥrī</i>, sea-borne or over-sea, is found in the <i>Akbar-nāma</i> (Bib.
Ind. ed. ii, 216) where the African elephant is described as <i>fīl-i-daryā’ī</i>.</p>

<p>(2) In Egypt the word <i>baḥrī</i> has acquired the sense of
northern, presumably referring to what lies or is borne across its
northern sea, the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>(3) Vigne (<i>Travels in Kashmīr</i> ii, 277-8) warns against
confounding the <i>qūch-qār</i> <i>i.e.</i> the gigantic <i>moufflon</i>, Pallas’
<i>Ovis ammon</i>, with the <i>Kosh-gau</i>, the cow of the Kaucasus, <i>i.e.</i> the
yāk. He says, “Kaucasus (<i>hodie</i> Hindū-kush) was originally
from Kosh, and Kosh is applied occasionally as a prefix, <i>e.g.</i>
<i>Kosh-gau</i>, the yāk or ox of the mountain or Kaucasus.” He
wrote from Skardo in Little Tibet and on the upper Indus.
He gives the name of the female yāk as <i>yāk-mo</i> and of the
half-breeds with common cows as <i>bzch</i>, which class he says is
common and of “all colours”.</p>

<p>(4) Mr. Ney Elias’ notes (<i>Tārīkh-i-rashīdī</i> trs. pp. 302 and
466) on the <i>qūt̤ās</i> are of great interest. He gives the following
synonymous names for the wild yāk, <i>Bos Po&euml;phagus</i>, <i>Khāsh-gau</i>,
the Tibetan yāk or Dong.</p>

<p>(5) Hume and Henderson (<i>Lāhor to Yārkand</i> p. 59) write of
the numerous black yāk-hair tents seen round the Pangong Lake,
of fine saddle yāks, and of the tame ones as being some white or
brown but mostly black.</p>

<p>(6) Olufsen’s <i>Through the Unknown Pamirs</i> (p. 118) speaks
of the large numbers of <i>Bos grunniens</i> (yāk) domesticated by
the Kirghiz in the Pamirs.</p>

<p>(7) Cf. Gazetteer of India <i>s.n.</i> yāk.</p>

<p>(8) Shaikh Zain applies the word <i>baḥrī</i> to the porpoise, when
paraphrasing the <i>Bābur-nāma</i> f. 281<i>b</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="a_xlviii" id="a_xlviii">[Pg xlviii]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="n" id="n"></a>N.&mdash;NOTES ON A FEW BIRDS.</h3>

<p>In attempting to identify some of the birds of Bābur’s lists
difficulty arises from the variety of names provided by the
different tongues of the region concerned, and also in some
cases by the application of one name to differing birds. The
following random gleanings enlarge and, in part, revise some
earlier notes and translations of Mr. Erskine’s and my own.
They are offered as material for the use of those better acquainted
with bird-lore and with Himālayan dialects.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>a.</i> <i>Concerning the lūkha</i>, <i>lūja</i>, <i>lūcha</i>, <i>kūja</i> (f.135 and f.278<i>b</i>).</p>

<p>The nearest word I have found to <i>lūkha</i> and its similars is
<i>likkh</i>, a florican (Jerdon, ii, 615), but the florican has not the
chameleon colours of the <i>lūkha</i> (var.). As Bābur when writing
in Hindūstān, uses such “book-words” as Ar. <i>baḥrī</i> (<i>qūt̤ās</i>) and
Ar. <i>bū-qalamūn</i> (chameleon), it would not be strange if his name
for the “<i>lūkha</i>” bird represented Ar. <i>awja</i>, very beautiful, or
connected with Ar. <i>loḥ</i>, shining splendour.</p>

<p>The form <i>kūja</i> is found in Ilminsky’s imprint p.361 (<i>Mémoires</i>
ii, 198, <i>koudjeh</i>).</p>

<p>What is confusing to translators is that (as it now seems to
me) Bābur appears to use the name <i>kabg-i-darī</i> in both passages
(f.135 and f.278<i>b</i>) to represent two birds; (1) he compares the
<i>lūkha</i> as to size with the <i>kabg-i-darī</i> of the Kābul region, and
(2) for size and colour with that of Hindūstān. But the bird, of
the Western Himālayas known by the name <i>kabg-i-darī</i> is the
Himālayan snow-cock, <i>Tetraogallus himālayensis</i>, Turkī, <i>aūlār</i>
and in the Kābul region, <i>chīūrtika</i> (f.249, Jerdon, ii, 549-50);
while the <i>kabg-i-darī</i> (syn. <i>chikor</i>) of Hindūstān, whether of
hill or plain, is one or more of much smaller birds.</p>

<p>The snow-cock being 28 inches in length, the <i>lūkha</i> bird must
be of this size. Such birds as to size and plumage of changing
colour are the <i>Lophophori</i> and <i>Trapagons</i>, varieties of which are
found in places suiting Bābur’s account of the <i>lūkha</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="a_xlix" id="a_xlix">[Pg xlix]</a></span></p>

<p>It may be noted that the Himālayan snow-cock is still called
<i>kabg-i-darī</i> in Afghānistān (Jerdon, ii, 550) and in Kashmīr
(Vigne’s <i>Travels in Kashmīr</i> ii, 18). As its range is up to
18,000 feet, its Persian name describes it correctly whether read
as “of the mountains” (<i>dari</i>), or as “royal” (<i>darī</i>) through its
splendour.</p>

<p class="tb">I add here the following notes of Mr. Erskine’s, which I have
not quoted already where they occur (cf. f. 135 and f. 278<i>b</i>):&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>b. Birds called mūnāl (var. monāl and moonaul).</i></p>

<p>Yule writing in <i>Hobson Jobson</i> (p. 580) of the “<i>moonaul</i>” which
he identifies as <i>Lophophorus Impeyanus</i>, queries whether, on
grounds he gives, the word <i>moonaul</i> is connected etymologically
with Sanscrit <i>muni</i>, an “eremite”. In continuation of his topic,
I give here the names of other birds called <i>mūnāl</i>, which I have
noticed in various ornithological works while turning their pages
for other information.</p>

<p>Besides <i>L. Impeyanus</i> and <i>Trapagon Ceriornis satyra</i> which
Yule mentions as called “<i>moonaul</i>”, there are <i>L. refulgens</i>,
<i>mūnāl</i> and <i>Ghūr</i> (mountain)-<i>mūnāl</i>; <i>Trapagon Ceriornis satyra</i>,
called <i>mūnāl</i> in Nipāl; <i>T. C. melanocephalus</i>, called <i>sing</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="a_l" id="a_l">[Pg l]</a></span>
(horned)-<i>mūnāl</i> in the N.W. Himālayas; <i>T. himālayensis</i>, the
<i>jer</i>- or <i>cher-mūnāl</i> of the same region, known also as <i>chikor</i>;
and <i>Lerwa nevicola</i>, the snow-partridge known in Garhwal as
<i>Quoir</i>- or <i>Qūr-mūnāl</i>. Do all these birds behave in such a way
as to suggest that <i>mūnāl</i> may imply the individual isolation
related by Jerdon of <i>L. Impeyanus</i>, “In the autumnal and winter
months numbers are generally collected in the same quarter of
the forest, though often so widely scattered that each bird
appears to be alone?” My own search amongst vocabularies of
hill-dialects for the meaning of the word has been unsuccessful,
spite of the long range <i>mūnāls</i> in the Himālayas.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>c. Concerning the word chīūrtika, chourtka.</i></p>

<p>Jerdon’s entry (ii, 549, 554) of the name <i>chourtka</i> as a
synonym of <i>Tetraogallus himālayensis</i> enables me to fill a gap
I have left on f. 249 (p. 491 and n. 6),<a name="FNanchor_2810" id="FNanchor_2810"></a><a href="#Footnote_2810" class="fnanchor">2810</a> with the name Himālayan
snow-cock, and to allow Bābur’s statement to be that he, in
January 1520 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span> when coming down from the <i>Bād-i-pīch</i> pass,
saw many snow-cocks. The <i>Memoirs</i> (p.282) has “<i>chikors</i>”,
which in India is a synonym for <i>kabg-i-darī</i>; the <i>Mémoires</i>
(ii, 122) has <i>sauterelles</i>, but this meaning of <i>chīūrtika</i> does not
suit wintry January. That month would suit for the descent
from higher altitudes of snow-cocks. Griffith, a botanist who
travelled in Afghānistān <i>cir.</i> 1838 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>, saw myriads of <i>cicadæ</i>
between Qilat-i-ghilzai and Ghazni, but the month was July.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>d.</i> <i>On the qūt̤ān</i> (f. 142, p. 224; <i>Memoirs</i>, p. 153; <i>Mémoires</i> ii, 313).</p>

<p>Mr. Erskine for <i>qūt̤ān</i> enters <i>khawāṣil</i> [gold-finch] which he
will have seen interlined in the Elphinstone Codex (f. 109<i>b</i>) in
explanation of <i>qūt̤ān</i>.</p>

<p>Shaikh Effendi (Kunos’ ed., p. 139) explains <i>qūt̤ān</i> to be the
gold-finch, <i>Steiglitz</i>.</p>

<p>Ilminsky’s <i>qūtān</i> (p. 175) is translated by M. de Courteille as
<i>pélicane</i> and certainly some copies of the 2nd Persian translation
[Muḥ. <i>Shīrāzi’s</i> p. 90] have <i>ḥawāṣil</i>, pelican.</p>

<p>The pelican would class better than the small finch with the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="a_li" id="a_li">[Pg li]</a></span>
herons and egrets of Bābur’s trio; it also would appear a more
likely bird to be caught “with the cord”.</p>

<p>That Bābur’s <i>qūt̤ān</i> (<i>ḥawāṣil</i>) migrated in great numbers is
however against supposing it to be <i>Pelicanus onocrotatus</i> which
is seen in India during the winter, because it appears there in
moderate numbers only, and Blanford with other ornithologists
states that no western pelican migrates largely into India.</p>

<p>Perhaps the <i>qūt̤ān</i> was Linnæus’ <i>Pelicanus carbo</i> of which
one synonym is <i>Carbo comoranus</i>, the cormorant, a bird seen in
India in large numbers of both the large and small varieties.
As cormorants are not known to breed in that country, they
will have migrated in the masses Bābur mentions.</p>

<p>A translation matter falls to mention here:&mdash;After saying
that the <i>aūqār</i> (grey heron), <i>qarqara</i> (egret), and <i>qūtān</i>
(cormorant) are taken with the cord, Bābur says that this
method of bird-catching is unique (<i>bū nūḥ qūsh tūtmāq ghair
muqarrar dūr</i>) and describes it. The Persian text omits to
translate the <i>tūtmāq</i> (by <i>P. giriftan</i>); hence Erskine (<i>Mems.</i>
p. 153) writes, “The last mentioned fowl” (<i>i.e.</i> the <i>qūt̤ān</i>) “is
rare,” notwithstanding Bābur’s statement that all three of the
birds he names are caught in masses. De Courteille (p. 313)
writes, as though only of the <i>qūtān</i>, “<i>ces derniers toutefois ne se
prennent qu’accidentelment</i>,” perhaps led to do so by knowledge
of the circumstance that <i>Pelicanus onocrotatus</i> is rare in India.</p>

<h3><a name="o" id="o"></a>O.&mdash;NOTES BY HUMĀYŪN ON SOME
HINDŪSTĀN FRUITS.</h3>

<p>The following notes, which may be accepted as made by
Humāyūn and in the margin of the archetype of the Elphinstone
Codex, are composed in Turkī which differs in diction from his
father’s but is far closer to that classic model than is that of the
producer [Jahāngīr?] of the “Fragments” (Index <i>s.n.</i>). Various
circumstances make the notes difficult to decipher <i>verbatim</i> and,
unfortunately, when writing in Jan. 1917, I am unable to collate<span class='pagenum'><a name="a_lii" id="a_lii">[Pg lii]</a></span>
with its original in the Advocates Library, the copy I made of
them in 1910.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>a.</i> <i>On the kadhil</i>, <i>jack-fruit</i>, <i>Artocarpus integrifolia</i> (f. 283<i>b</i>, p. 506;

<p>The contents of the note are that the strange-looking pumpkin
(<i>qar‘</i>, which is also Ibn Batuta’s word for the fruit), yields
excellent white juice, that the best fruit grows from the roots of
the tree,<a name="FNanchor_2812" id="FNanchor_2812"></a><a href="#Footnote_2812" class="fnanchor">2812</a> that many such grow in Bengal, and that in Bengal
and Dihli there grows a <i>kadhil</i>-tree covered with hairs (<i>Artocarpus

<p class="indent"><i>b.</i> <i>On the amrit-phal</i>, <i>mandarin-orange</i>, <i>Citrus aurantium</i> (f. 287,
p. 512; Elphinstone Codex, f. 238<i>b</i>, l. 12).</p>

<p>The interest of this note lies in its reference to Bābur.</p>

<p>A Persian version of it is entered, without indication of what
it is or of who was its translator, in one of the volumes of
Mr. Erskine’s manuscript remains, now in the British Museum
(Add. 26,605, p. 88). Presumably it was made by his Turkish
<i>munshi</i> for his note in the Memoirs (p. 329).</p>

<p>Various difficulties oppose the translation of the Turkī note;
it is written into the text of the Elphinstone Codex in two
instalments, neither of them in place, the first being interpolated
in the account of the <i>amil-bīd</i> fruit, the second in that of the
<i>jāsūn</i> flower; and there are verbal difficulties also. The Persian
translation is not literal and in some particulars Mr. Erskine’s
rendering of this differs from what the Turkī appears to state.</p>

<p>The note is, tentatively, as follows:<a name="FNanchor_2813" id="FNanchor_2813"></a><a href="#Footnote_2813" class="fnanchor">2813</a>&mdash;“His honoured Majesty

it to the mild-flavoured<a name="FNanchor_2817" id="FNanchor_2817"></a><a href="#Footnote_2817" class="fnanchor">2817</a> orange and did not make choice of it.
So much was the mild-flavoured orange despised that if any
person had disgusted (him) by insipid flattery(?) he used to
say, ‘He is like orange-juice.’”<a name="FNanchor_2818" id="FNanchor_2818"></a><a href="#Footnote_2818" class="fnanchor">2818</a></p>

<p>“The <i>amrit-phal</i> is one of the very good fruits. Though its
juice is not relishing (? <i>chūchūq</i>), it is extremely pleasant-drinking.
Later on, in my own time, its real merit became known. Its
tartness may be that of the orange (<i>nāranj</i>)and <i>lemu</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_2819" id="FNanchor_2819"></a><a href="#Footnote_2819" class="fnanchor">2819</a></p>

<p>The above passage is followed, in the text of the Elphinstone
Codex, by Bābur’s account of the <i>jāsūn</i> flower, and into this
a further instalment of Humāyūn’s notes is interpolated, having
opposite its first line the marginal remark, “This extra note,
seemingly made by Humāyūn Pādshāh, the scribe has mistakenly
written into the text.” Whether its first sentence refer to the
<i>amrit-phal</i> or to the <i>amil-bīd</i> must be left for decision to those
well acquainted with the orange-tribe. It is obscure in my copy
and abbreviated in its Persian translation; summarized it may
state that when the fruit is unripe, its acidity is harmful to the
digestion, but that it is very good when ripe.&mdash;The note then
continues as below:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>c. The kāmila, H. kauṅlā, the orange.</i><a name="FNanchor_2820" id="FNanchor_2820"></a><a href="#Footnote_2820" class="fnanchor">2820</a></p>

<p>“There are in Bengal two other fruits of the acid kind.
Though the <i>amrit-phal</i> be not agreeable, they have resemblance
to it (?).”</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="a_liv" id="a_liv">[Pg liv]</a></span></p>
<p>“One is the <i>kāmila</i> which may be as large as an orange
(<i>nāranj</i>); some took it to be a large <i>nārangī</i> (orange) but it is
much pleasanter eating than the <i>nārangī</i> and is understood not
to have the skin of that (fruit).”</p>

<p class="indent"><i>d. The samt̤ara.</i><a name="FNanchor_2821" id="FNanchor_2821"></a><a href="#Footnote_2821" class="fnanchor">2821</a></p>

<p>“The other is the <i>samt̤ara</i> which is larger than the orange
(<i>nāranj</i>) but is not tart; unlike the <i>amrit-phal</i> it is not of poor
flavour (<i>kam maza</i>) or little relish (<i>chūchūk</i>). In short a better
fruit is not seen. It is good to see, good to eat, good to digest.
One does not forget it. If it be there, no other fruit is chosen.
Its peel may be taken off by the hand. However much of the
fruit be eaten, the heart craves for it again. Its juice does not
soil the hand at all. Its skin separates easily from its flesh.
It may be taken during and after food. In Bengal the <i>samt̤ara</i>
is rare (<i>ghārib</i>) (or excellent, <i>‘asīz</i>). It is understood to grow
in one village Sanārgām (Sonargaon) and even therein a special
quarter. There seems to be no fruit so entirely good as the
<i>samt̤ara</i> amongst fruits of its class or, rather, amongst fruits of
all kinds.”</p>

<h3><a name="p" id="p"></a>P.&mdash;REMARKS ON BĀBUR’S REVENUE
LIST (fol. 292).</h3>

<p class="indent"><i>a. Concerning the date of the List.</i></p>

<p>The Revenue List is the last item of Bābur’s account of Hindūstān
and, with that account, is found <i>s.a.</i> 932 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>, manifestly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="a_lv" id="a_lv">[Pg lv]</a></span>
too early, (1) because it includes districts and their revenues
which did not come under Bābur’s authority until subdued in
his Eastern campaigns of 934 and 935 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>, (2) because Bābur’s
statement is that the “countries” of the List “are <i>now</i> in my
possession” (<i>in loco</i> p. 520).</p>

<p>The List appears to be one of revenues realized in 936 or
937 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> and not one of assessment or estimated revenue,
(1) because Bābur’s wording states as a fact that the revenue
was 52 <i>krūrs</i>; (2) because the Persian heading of the (Persian)
List is translatable as “Revenue (<i>jama‘</i>)<a name="FNanchor_2822" id="FNanchor_2822"></a><a href="#Footnote_2822" class="fnanchor">2822</a> of Hindūstān from
what has so far come under the victorious standards”.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>b. The entry of the List into European Literature.</i></p>

<p>Readers of the L. and E. <i>Memoirs of Bābur</i> are aware that
it does not contain the Revenue List (p. 334). The omission is
due to the absence of the List from the Elphinstone Codex and
from the ‘Abdu’r-raḥīm Persian translation. Since the <i>Memoirs
of Bābur</i> was published in 1826 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>, the List has come from the
<i>Bābur-nāma</i> into European literature by three channels.</p>

<p>Of the three the one used earliest is Shaikh Zain’s <i>T̤abaqāt-i-bāburī</i>
which is a Persian paraphrase of part of Bābur’s Hindūstān
section. This work provided Mr. Erskine with what he placed
in his <i>History of India</i> (London 1854, i, 540, Appendix D), but
his manuscript, now B.M. Add. 26,202, is not the best copy
of Shaikh Zain’s book, being of far less importance than B.M.
Or. 1999, [as to which more will be said.]<a name="FNanchor_2823" id="FNanchor_2823"></a><a href="#Footnote_2823" class="fnanchor">2823</a></p>

<p>The second channel is Dr. Ilminsky’s imprint of the Turkī
text (Kāsān 1857, p. 379), which is translated by the <i>Mémoires
de Bāber</i> (Paris 1871, ii, 230).</p>

<p>The third channel is the Ḥaidarābād Codex, in the English
translation of which [<i>in loco</i>] the List is on p. 521.</p>

<p>Shaikh Zain may have used Bābur’s autograph manuscript
for his paraphrase and with it the Revenue List. His own
autograph manuscript was copied in 998 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (1589-90 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>) by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="a_lvi" id="a_lvi">[Pg lvi]</a></span>Khwānd-amīr’s grandson ‘Abdu’l-lāh who may be the scribe
“Mīr ‘Abdu’l-lāh” of the <i>Āyīn-i-akbarī</i> (Blochmann’s trs. p. 109).
‘Abdu’l-lāh’s transcript (from which a portion is now absent,)
after having been in Sir Henry Elliot’s possession, has become
B.M. Or. 1999. It is noticed briefly by Professor Dowson (<i>l.c.</i>
iv, 288), but he cannot have observed that the “old, worm-eaten”
little volume contains Bābur’s Revenue List, since he does not
refer to it.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>c. Agreement and variation in copies of the List.</i></p>

<p>The figures in the two copies (Or. 1999 and Add. 26,202) of
the <i>T̤abaqāt-i-bāburī</i> are in close agreement. They differ, however,
from those in the Ḥaidarābād Codex, not only in a negligible
unit and a ten of <i>tankas</i> but in having 20,000 more <i>tankas</i>
from Oudh and Baraich and 30 <i>laks</i> of <i>tankas</i> more from Trans-sutlej.</p>

<p>The figures in the two copies of the <i>Bābur-nāma</i>, <i>viz.</i> the
Ḥaidarābād Codex and the Kehr-Ilminsky imprint are not in
agreement throughout, but are identical in opposition to the
variants (20,000 <i>t.</i> and 30 <i>l.</i>) mentioned above. As the two are
independent, being collateral descendants of Bābur’s original
papers, the authority of the Ḥaidarābād Codex in the matter
of the List is still further enhanced.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>d. Varia.</i></p>

<p>(1) The place-names of the List are all traceable, whatever
their varied forms. About the entry L:knū [or L:knūr] and B:ks:r
[or M:ks:r] a difficulty has been created by its variation in
manuscripts, not only in the List but where the first name occurs
<i>s.a.</i> 934 and 935 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> In the Ḥaidarābād List and in that of
Or. 1999 L:knūr is clearly written and may represent (approximately)
modern Shahābād in Rāmpūr. Erskine and de
Courteille, however, have taken it to be Lakhnau in Oudh.
[The distinction of Lakhnaur from Lakhnau in the historical
narrative is discussed in Appendix T.]</p>

<p>(2) It may be noted, as of interest, that the name Sarwār is
an abbreviation of Sarjūpār which means “other side of Sarjū”
(Sarū, Goghrā; E. and D.’s H. of I. i, 56, n.4).<span class='pagenum'><a name="a_lvii" id="a_lvii">[Pg lvii]</a></span></p>

<p>(3) Rūp-narā[:i]n (Deo or Dev) is mentioned in Ajodhya
Prasad’s short history of Tirhut and Darbhanga, the <i>Gulzār-i-Bihār</i>
(Calcutta 1869, Cap. v, 88) as the 9th of the Brahman
rulers of Tirhut and as having reigned for 25 years, from 917 to
942 <i>Faslī</i>(?). If the years were Ḥijrī, 917-42 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> would be
1511-1535.<a name="FNanchor_2824" id="FNanchor_2824"></a><a href="#Footnote_2824" class="fnanchor">2824</a></p>

<p>(4) Concerning the <i>tanka</i> the following modern description
is quoted from Mr. R. Shaw’s <i>High Tartary</i> (London 1871,
p. 464) “The <i>tanga</i>” (or <i>tanka</i>) “is a nominal coin, being
composed of 25 little copper cash, with holes pierced in them
and called <i>dahcheen</i>. These are strung together and the quantity
of them required to make up the value of one of these silver
ingots” (“<i>kooroos</i> or <i>yamboo</i>, value nearly <i>&pound;</i>17”) “weighs
a considerable amount. I once sent to get change for a <i>kooroos</i>,
and my servants were obliged to charter a donkey to bring it
home.”</p>

<p>(5) The following interesting feature of Shaikh Zain’s
<i>T̤abaqāt-i-bāburī</i> has been mentioned to me by my husband:&mdash;Its
author occasionally reproduces Bābur’s Turkī words instead of
paraphrasing them in Persian, and does this for the noticeable
passage in which Bābur records his dissatisfied view of Hindūstān
(f. 290<i>b</i>, <i>in loco</i> p. 518), prefacing his quotation with the remark
that it is best and will be nearest to accuracy not to attempt
translation but to reproduce the Pādshāh’s own words. The
main interest of the matter lies in the motive for reproducing the
<i>ipsissima verba</i>. Was that motive deferential? Did the revelation
of feeling and opinion made in the quoted passage clothe it with
privacy so that Shaikh Zain reserved its perusal from the larger
public of Hindūstān who might read Persian but not Turkī?
Some such motive would explain the insertion untranslated of
Bābur’s letters to Humāyūn and to Khwāja Kalān which are left
in Turkī by ‘Abdu’r-raḥīm Mīrzā.<a name="FNanchor_2825" id="FNanchor_2825"></a><a href="#Footnote_2825" class="fnanchor">2825</a></p>

<h3><a name="q" id="q"></a>Q.&mdash;CONCERNING THE “RĀMPŪR DĪWĀN”.</h3>

<p>Pending the wide research work necessary to interpret Bābur’s
Hindūstān poems which the Rāmpūr manuscript preserves, the
following comments, some tentative and open to correction,
may carry further in making the poems publicly known, what
Dr. E. Denison Ross has effected by publishing his Facsimile
of the manuscript.<a name="FNanchor_2826" id="FNanchor_2826"></a><a href="#Footnote_2826" class="fnanchor">2826</a> It is legitimate to associate comment on
the poems with the <i>Bābur-nāma</i> because many of them are in
it with their context of narrative; most, if not all, connect with
it; some without it, would be dull and vapid.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>a. An authorized English title.</i></p>

<p>The contents of the Rāmpūr MS. are precisely what Bābur
describes sending to four persons some three weeks after the date
attached to the manuscript,<a name="FNanchor_2827" id="FNanchor_2827"></a><a href="#Footnote_2827" class="fnanchor">2827</a> <i>viz.</i> “the Translation and whatnot
of poems made on coming to Hindūstān”;<a name="FNanchor_2828" id="FNanchor_2828"></a><a href="#Footnote_2828" class="fnanchor">2828</a> and a similar
description may be meant in the curiously phrased first clause
of the colophon, but without mention of the Translation (of the
<i>Wālidiyyah-risāla</i>).<a name="FNanchor_2829" id="FNanchor_2829"></a><a href="#Footnote_2829" class="fnanchor">2829</a> Hence, if the poems, including the Translation,
became known as the <i>Hindūstān Poems</i> or <i>Poems made in
Hindūstān</i>, such title would be justified by their author’s words.
Bābur does not call the Hindūstān poems a <i>dīwān</i> even when,
as in the above quotation, he speaks of them apart from his
versified translation of the Tract. In what has come down to
us of his autobiography, he applies the name <i>Dīwān</i> to poems of
his own once only, this in 925 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (f. 237<i>b</i>) when he records
sending “my <i>dīwān</i>” to Pūlād Sl. <i>Aūzbeg</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="a_lix" id="a_lix">[Pg lix]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent"><i>b. The contents of the Rāmpūr MS.</i></p>

<p>There are three separate items of composition in the manuscript,
marked as distinct from one another by having each its
ornamented frontispiece, each its scribe’s sign (<i>mīm</i>) of Finis,
each its division from its neighbour by a space without entry.
The first and second sections bear also the official sign [<i>ṣaḥḥ</i>] that
the copy has been inspected and found correct.</p>

<p>(1) The first section consists of Bābur’s metrical translation
of Khwāja ‘Ubaidu’l-lāh <i>Aḥrārī’s Parental Tract</i> (<i>Wālidiyyah-risāla</i>),
his prologue in which are his reasons for versifying the
Tract and his epilogue which gives thanks for accomplishing the
task. It ends with the date 935 (Ḥai. MS. f. 346). Below this
are <i>mīm</i> and <i>ṣaḥḥ</i>, the latter twice; they are in the scribe’s handwriting,
and thus make against supposing that Bābur wrote down
this copy of the Tract or its archetype from which the official
<i>ṣaḥḥ</i> will have been copied. Moreover, spite of bearing two
vouchers of being a correct copy, the Translation is emended, in
a larger script which may be that of the writer of the marginal
quatrain on the last page of the [Rāmpūr] MS. and there attested
by Shāh-i-jahān as Bābur’s autograph entry. His also may have
been the now expunged writing on the half-page left empty of
text at the end of the Tract. Expunged though it be, fragments
of words are visible.<a name="FNanchor_2830" id="FNanchor_2830"></a><a href="#Footnote_2830" class="fnanchor">2830</a></p>

<p>(2) The second section has in its frontispiece an inscription
illegible (to me) in the Facsimile. It opens with a <i>masnawī</i> of
41 couplets which is followed by a <i>ghazel</i> and numerous poems
in several measures, down to a triad of rhymed couplets (<i>matla‘</i>?),
the whole answering to descriptions of a <i>Dīwān</i> without formal
arrangement. After the last couplet are <i>mīm</i> and <i>ṣaḥḥ</i> in the
scribe’s hand-writing, and a blank quarter-page. Mistakes in
this section have been left uncorrected, which supports the view
that its <i>ṣaḥḥ</i> avouches the accuracy of its archetype and not
its own.<a name="FNanchor_2831" id="FNanchor_2831"></a><a href="#Footnote_2831" class="fnanchor">2831</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="a_lx" id="a_lx">[Pg lx]</a></span></p>
<p>(3) The third section shows no inscription on its frontispiece.
It opens with the <i>masnawī</i> of eight couplets, found also in the
<i>Bābur-nāma</i> (f. 312), one of earlier date than many of the poems
in the second section. It is followed by three <i>rubā‘ī</i> which
complete the collection of poems made in Hindūstān. A prose
passage comes next, describing the composition and transposition-in-metre
of a couplet of 16 feet, with examples in three
measures, the last of which ends in l. 4 of the photograph.&mdash;While
fixing the date of this metrical game, Bābur incidentally
allows that of his <i>Treatise on Prosody</i> to be inferred from the
following allusive words:&mdash;“When going to Saṃbhal (f. 330<i>b</i>) in
the year (933 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>) after the conquest of Hindūstān (932 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>), two
years after writing the <i>‘Arūẓ</i>, I composed a couplet of 16 feet.”&mdash;From
this the date of the Treatise is seen to be 931 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>, some
two years later than that of the <i>Mubīn</i>. The above metrical
exercise was done about the same time as another concerning
which a Treatise was written, viz. that mentioned on f. 330<i>b</i>,
when a couplet was transposed into 504 measures (Section <i>f</i>,
p. lxv).&mdash;The Facsimile, it will be noticed, shows something
unusual in the last line of the prose passage on Plate XVIII B,
where the scattering of the words suggests that the scribe was
trying to copy page <i>per</i> page.</p>

<p>The colophon (which begins on l. 5 of the photograph) is
curiously worded, as though the frequent fate of last pages had
befallen its archetype, that of being mutilated and difficult for
a scribe to make good; it suggests too that the archetype
was verse.<a name="FNanchor_2832" id="FNanchor_2832"></a><a href="#Footnote_2832" class="fnanchor">2832</a> Its first clause, even if read as <i>Hind-stān jānibī
‘azīmat qīlghānī</i> (i.e. not <i>qīlghālī</i>, as it can be read), has an
indirectness unlike Bābur’s corresponding “after coming to
Hindūstān” (f. 357<i>b</i>), and is not definite; (2) <i>bū aīrdī</i> (these
were) is not the complement suiting <i>aūl dūrūr</i> (those are);
(3) Bābur does not use the form <i>dūrūr</i> in prose; (4) the undue
space after <i>dūrūr</i> suggests connection with verse; (5) there is
no final verb such as prose needs. The meaning, however,
may be as follows:&mdash;The poems made after resolving on (the)
<span class='pagenum'><a name="a_lxi" id="a_lxi">[Pg lxi]</a></span>
Hindūstān parts (<i>jānibī</i>?) were these I have written down (<i>taḥrīr
qīldīm</i>), and past events are those I have narrated (<i>taqrīr</i>) in the
way that (<i>nī-chūk kīm</i>) (has been) written in these folios (<i>aūrāq</i>)
and recorded in those sections (<i>ajzā'</i>).&mdash;From this it would
appear that sections of the <i>Bābur-nāma</i> (f. 376<i>b</i>, p. 678) accompanied
the Hindūstān poems to the recipient of the message
conveyed by the colophon.</p>

<img src="images/fig5.jpg" width="500" height="779" alt="The colophon" title="" />
</div>

<p>Close under the colophon stands <i>Ḥarara-hu Bābur</i> and the date
Monday, Rabī‘ II. 15th 935 (Monday, December 27th 1528 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>),
the whole presumably brought over from the archetype. To the
question whether a signature in the above form would be copied
by a scribe, the Elphinstone Codex gives an affirmative answer
by providing several examples of notes, made by Humāyūn in
its archetype, so-signed and brought over either into its margin
or interpolated in its text. Some others of Humāyūn’s notes
are not so-signed, the scribe merely saying they are Humāyūn
Pādshāh’s.&mdash;It makes against taking the above entry of Bābur’s
name to be an autograph signature, (1) that it is enclosed in an
ornamented border, as indeed is the case wherever it occurs
throughout the manuscript; (2) that it is followed by the
scribe’s <i>mīm</i>. [See end of following section.]</p>

<p class="indent"><i>c. The marginal entries shown in the photograph.</i></p>

<p>The marginal note written length-wise by the side of the text
is signed by Shāh-i-jahān and attests that the <i>rubā‘ī</i> and the
signature to which it makes reference are in Bābur’s autograph
hand-writing. His note translates as follows:&mdash;This quatrain
and blessed name are in the actual hand-writing of that Majesty
(<i>ān ḥaẓrat</i>) <i>Firdaus-makānī</i> Bābur Pādshāh <i>Ghāzī</i>&mdash;May God
make his proof clear!&mdash;Signed (<i>Ḥararā-hu</i>), Shāh-i-jahān son
of Jahāngīr Pādshāh son of Akbar Pādshāh son of Humāyūn
Pādshāh son of Bābur Pādshāh.<a name="FNanchor_2833" id="FNanchor_2833"></a><a href="#Footnote_2833" class="fnanchor">2833</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="a_lxii" id="a_lxii">[Pg lxii]</a></span></p>
<p>The second marginal entry is the curiously placed <i>rubā‘ī</i>, which
is now the only one on the page, and now has no signature
attaching to it. It has the character of a personal message to
the recipient of one of more books having identical contents.
That these two entries are there while the text seems so clearly
to be written by a scribe, is open to the explanation that when
(as said about the colophon, p. lx) the rectangle of text was made
good from a mutilated archetype, the original margin was placed
round the <i>rifacimento</i>? This superposition would explain the
entries and seal-like circles, discernible against a strong light, on
the reverse of the margin only, through the <i>rifacimento</i> page.
The upper edge of the rectangle shows sign that the margin has
been adjusted to it [so far as one can judge from a photograph].
Nothing on the face of the margin hints that the text itself is
autograph; the words of the colophon, <i>taḥrīr qīldīm</i> (<i>i.e.</i> I have
written down) cannot hold good against the cumulative testimony
that a scribe copied the whole manuscript.&mdash;The position of the
last syllable [<i>nī</i>] of the <i>rubā‘ī</i> shows that the signature below
the colophon was on the margin before the diagonal couplet of
the <i>rubā‘ī</i> was written,&mdash;therefore when the margin was fitted,
as it looks to have been fitted, to the <i>rifacimento</i>. If this be the
order of the two entries [<i>i.e.</i> the small-hand signature and the
diagonal couplet], Shāh-i-jahān’s “blessed name” may represent
the small-hand signature which certainly shows minute
differences from the writing of the text of the MS. in the name
Bābur (<i>q.v. passim</i> in the Rāmpūr MS.).</p>

<p class="indent"><i>d. The Bāburī-khat̤t̤</i> (<i>Bābūr’s script</i>).</p>

<p>So early as 910 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> the year of his conquest of Kābul, Bābur
devised what was probably a variety of <i>nakhsh</i>, and called it the
<i>Bāburī-khat̤t̤</i> (f. 144<i>b</i>), a name used later by Ḥaidar Mīrzā,
Niz̤āmu’d-dīn Aḥmad and ‘Abdu’l-qādir <i>Badāyūnī</i>. He writes
of it again (f. 179) <i>s.a.</i> 911 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> when describing an interview had
in 912 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> with one of the Harāt Qāẓīs, at which the script was
discussed, its specialities (<i>mufradāt</i>) exhibited to, and read by the
Qāẓī who there and then wrote in it.<a name="FNanchor_2834" id="FNanchor_2834"></a><a href="#Footnote_2834" class="fnanchor">2834</a> In what remains to us
<span class='pagenum'><a name="a_lxiii" id="a_lxiii">[Pg lxiii]</a></span>
of the <i>Bābur-nāma</i> it is not mentioned again till 935 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (fol. 357<i>b</i>)
but at some intermediate date Bābur made in it a copy of the
Qorān which he sent to Makka.<a name="FNanchor_2835" id="FNanchor_2835"></a><a href="#Footnote_2835" class="fnanchor">2835</a> In 935 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (f. 357<i>b</i>) it is
mentioned in significant association with the despatch to each
of four persons of a copy of the Translation (of the <i>Wālidiyyah-risāla</i>)
and the Hindūstān poems, the significance of the association
being that the simultaneous despatch with these copies
of specimens of the <i>Bāburī-khat̤t̤</i> points to its use in the manuscripts,
and at least in Hind-āl’s case, to help given for reading
novel forms in their text. The above are the only instances
now found in the <i>Bābur-nāma</i> of mention of the script.</p>

<p>The little we have met with&mdash;we have made no search&mdash;about
the character of the script comes from the <i>Abūshqa</i>, <i>s.n.</i> <i>sīghnāq</i>,
in the following entry:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sīghnāq ber nū‘ah khat̤t̤ der Chaghatāīda khat̤t̤ Bāburī u ghairī
kibī ki Bābur Mīrzā ash‘ār’nda kīlūr bait</i></p>

</div></div></div>

<p>The old Osmanli-Turkish prose part of this appears to mean:&mdash;“<i>Sīghnāq</i>
is a sort of hand-writing, in Chaghatāī the <i>Bāburī-khat̤t̤</i>
and others resembling it, as appears in Bābur Mīrzā’s
poems. Couplet”:&mdash;</p>

<p>Without knowing the context of the couplet I make no
attempt to translate it because its words <i>khat̤t̤</i> or <i>khaṭ</i> and</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="a_lxiv" id="a_lxiv">[Pg lxiv]</a></span></p><p><i>sīghnāq</i> lend themselves to the kind of pun (<i>īhām</i>) “which
consists in the employment of a word or phrase having more
than one appropriate meaning, whereby the reader is often left
in doubt as to the real significance of the passage.”<a name="FNanchor_2837" id="FNanchor_2837"></a><a href="#Footnote_2837" class="fnanchor">2837</a> The rest of
the <i>rubā‘ī</i> may be given [together with the six other quotations
of Bābur’s verse now known only through the <i>Abūshqa</i>], in early
<i>Taẕkirātu ‘sh-shu‘āra</i> of date earlier than 967 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span></p>

<p>The root of the word <i>sīghnāq</i> will be <i>sīq</i>, pressed together,
crowded, included, <i>etc.</i>; taking with this notion of compression,
the explanations <i>feine Schrift</i> of Shaikh Effendi (Kunos) and
Vambéry’s <i>pétite écriture</i>, the Sīghnāqī and Bāburī Scripts are
allowed to have been what that of the Rāmpūr MS. is, a small,
compact, elegant hand-writing.&mdash;A town in the Caucasus
named Sīghnākh, “<i>située &agrave; peu pr&egrave;s &agrave; 800 m&egrave;tres d’altitude,
commen&ccedil;a par &ecirc;tre une forteresse et un lieu de refuge, car telle
est la signification de son nom tartare</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_2838" id="FNanchor_2838"></a><a href="#Footnote_2838" class="fnanchor">2838</a> <i>Sīghnāqī</i> is given by
de Courteille (Dict. p. 368) as meaning a place of refuge or
shelter.</p>

<p>The <i>Bāburī-khat̤t̤</i> will be only one of the several hands Bābur
is reputed to have practised; its description matches it with
other niceties he took pleasure in, fine distinctions of eye and
ear in measure and music.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>e. Is the Rāmpūr MS. an example of the Bāburī-khat̤t̤?</i></p>

<p>Though only those well-acquainted with Oriental manuscripts
dating before 910 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (1504 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>) can judge whether novelties
appear in the script of the Rāmpūr MS. and this particularly
in its head-lines, there are certain grounds for thinking that
though the manuscript be not Bābur’s autograph, it may be in
his script and the work of a specially trained scribe.</p>

<p>I set these grounds down because although the signs of a
scribe’s work on the manuscript seem clear, it is “locally” held to
be Bābur’s autograph. Has a tradition of its being in the <i>Bāburī-khat̤t̤</i>
glided into its being in the <i>khat̤t̤-i-Bābur</i>? Several circumstances
suggest that it may be written in the <i>Bāburī-khat̤t̤:</i>&mdash;(1)
the script is specially associated with the four transcripts
<span class='pagenum'><a name="a_lxv" id="a_lxv">[Pg lxv]</a></span>
of the Hindūstān poems (f. 357<i>b</i>), for though many letters
must have gone to his sons, some indeed are mentioned in the
<i>Bābur-nāma</i>, it is only with the poems that specimens of it are
recorded as sent; (2) another matter shows his personal interest
in the arrangement of manuscripts, namely, that as he himself
about a month after the four books had gone off, made a new
ruler, particularly on account of the head-lines of the Translation,
it may be inferred that he had made or had adopted the one
he superseded, and that his plan of arranging the poems was the
model for copyists; the Rāmpūr MS. bearing, in the Translation
section, corrections which may be his own, bears also a date
earlier than that at which the four gifts started; it has its headlines
ill-arranged and has throughout 13 lines to the page; his
new ruler had 11; (3) perhaps the words <i>taḥrīr qīldīm</i> used in
the colophon of the Rāmpūr MS. should be read with their full
connotation of careful and elegant writing, or, put modestly, as
saying, “I wrote down in my best manner,” which for poems is
likely to be in the <i>Bāburī-khat̤t̤</i>.<a name="FNanchor_2839" id="FNanchor_2839"></a><a href="#Footnote_2839" class="fnanchor">2839</a></p>

<p>Perhaps an example of Bābur’s script exists in the colophon,
if not in the whole of the <i>Mubīn</i> manuscript once owned by
Berézine, by him used for his <i>Chréstomathie Turque</i>, and described
by him as “unique”. If this be the actual manuscript Bābur
sent into Mā warā’u’n-nahr (presumably to Khwāja Aḥrārī’s
family), its colophon which is a personal message addressed to
the recipients, is likely to be autograph.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>f. Metrical amusements.</i></p>

<p>(1) Of two instances of metrical amusements belonging to the
end of 933 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> and seeming to have been the distractions of
illness, one is a simple transposition “in the fashion of the
circles” (<i>dawā’ir</i>) into three measures (Rāmpūr MS. Facsimile,
Plate XVIII and p. 22); the other is difficult because of the high
number of 504 into which Bābur says (f. 330<i>b</i>) he cut up the
following couplet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line"><i>Gūz u qāsh u soz u tīlīnī mū dī?</i></div>
<div class="line"><i>Qad u khadd u saj u bīlīnī mū dī?</i></div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="a_lxvi" id="a_lxvi">[Pg lxvi]</a></span></p>
<p>All manuscripts agree in having 504, and Bābur wrote a tract
(<i>risāla</i>) upon the transpositions.<a name="FNanchor_2840" id="FNanchor_2840"></a><a href="#Footnote_2840" class="fnanchor">2840</a> None of the modern treatises
on Oriental Prosody allow a number so high to be practicable,
but Maulānā Saifī of Bukhārā, of Bābur’s own time (f. 180<i>b</i>)
makes 504 seem even moderate, since after giving much detail
about <i>rubā‘ī</i> measures, he observes, “Some say there are 10,000”
(<i>Arūẓ-i-Saifī</i>, Ranking’s trs. p. 122). Presumably similar possibilities
were open for the couplet in question. It looks like one
made for the game, asks two foolish questions and gives no
reply, lends itself to poetic license, and, if permutation of words
have part in such a game, allows much without change of sense.
Was Bābur’s cessation of effort at 504 capricious or enforced by
the exhaustion of possible changes? Is the arithmetical statement
9 &times; 8 &times; 7 = 504 the formula of the practicable permutations?</p>

<p>(2) To improvise verse having a given rhyme and topic must
have demanded quick wits and much practice. Bābur gives at
least one example of it (f. 252<i>b</i>) but Jahāngīr gives a fuller and
more interesting one, not only because a <i>rubā‘ī</i> of Bābur’s was the
model but from the circumstances of the game:<a name="FNanchor_2841" id="FNanchor_2841"></a><a href="#Footnote_2841" class="fnanchor">2841</a>&mdash;It was in
1024 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (1615 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>) that a letter reached him from Māwarā’u’n-nahr
written by Khwāja Hāshim <i>Naqsh-bandī</i> [who by the story
is shown to have been of Aḥrārī’s line], and recounting the
long devotion of his family to Jahāngīr’s ancestors. He sent
gifts and enclosed in his letter a copy of one of Bābur’s quatrains
which he said Ḥaẓrat Firdaus-makānī had written for Ḥaẓrat
Khwājagī (Aḥrārī’s eldest son; f. 36<i>b</i>, p. 62 n. 2). Jahāngīr
quotes a final hemistich only, “<i>Khwājagīra mānda’īm, Khwājagīrā
banda’īm</i>” and thereafter made an impromptu verse upon
the one sent to him.</p>

<p>A curious thing is that the line he quotes is not part of the
quatrain he answered, but belongs to another not appropriate for
a message between <i>darwesh</i> and <i>pādshāh</i>, though likely to have
been sent by Bābur to Khwājagī. I will quote both because
<span class='pagenum'><a name="a_lxvii" id="a_lxvii">[Pg lxvii]</a></span>the matter will come up again for who works on the Hindūstān
poems.<a name="FNanchor_2842" id="FNanchor_2842"></a><a href="#Footnote_2842" class="fnanchor">2842</a></p>

<p>(1) The quatrain from the <i>Hindūstān Poems</i> is:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line"><i>Dar hawā’ī nafs gumrah ‘umr ẓāi‘ karda’īm</i> [<i>kanda’īm</i>?];</div>
<div class="line"><i>Pesh ahl-i-allāh az af‘āl-i-khūd sharmanda’īm;</i></div>
<div class="line"><i>Yak naz̤r bā mukhlaṣān-i-khasta-dil farmā ki mā</i></div>
<div class="line"><i>Khwājagīrā mānda’īm u Khwājagīrā banda’īm.</i></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>(2) That from the <i>Akbar-nāma</i> is:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line"><i>Darweshānrā agarcha nah as khweshānīm,</i></div>
<div class="line"><i>Lek az dil u jān mu‘taqid eshānīm;</i></div>

<div class="line"><i>Shāhīm walī banda-i-darweshānīm.</i></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The greater suitability of the second is seen from Jahāngīr’s
answering impromptu for which by sense and rhyme it sets the
model; the meaning, however, of the fourth line in each may be
identical, namely, “I remain the ruler but am the servant of the
<i>darwesh</i>.” Jahāngīr’s impromptu is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line"><i>Āī ānki marā mihr-i-tū besh az besh ast,</i></div>

<div class="line"><i>Shadīm az ānki lat̤if az ḥadd besh ast.</i></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>He then called on those who had a turn for verse to “speak
one” <i>i.e.</i> to improvise on his own; it was done as follows:&mdash;</p>

<h3><a name="s" id="s"></a>S.&mdash;CONCERNING THE BĀBUR-NĀMA
DATING OF 935 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span></h3>

<p>The dating of the diary of 935 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (f. 339 <i>et seq.</i>) is several times
in opposition to what may be distinguished as the “book-rule”
that the 12 lunar months of the Ḥijra year alternate in length
between 30 and 29 days (intercalary years excepted), and that
Muḥarram starts the alternation with 30 days. An early book
stating the rule is Gladwin’s <i>Bengal Revenue Accounts</i>; a recent
one, Ranking’s ed. of Platts’ <i>Persian Grammar</i>.</p>

<p>As to what day of the week was the initial day of some of the
months in 935 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> Bābur’s days differ from W&uuml;stenfeld’s who
gives the full list of twelve, and from Cunningham’s single one of
Muḥarram 1st.</p>

<p>It seems worth while to draw attention to the flexibility,
within limits, of Bābur’s dating, [not with the object of adversely
criticizing a rigid and convenient rule for common use, but as
supplementary to that rule from a somewhat special source],
because he was careful and observant, his dating was contemporary,
his record, as being <i>de die in diem</i>, provides a check
of consecutive narrative on his dates, which, moreover, are all held
together by the external fixtures of Feasts and by the marked
recurrence of Fridays observed. Few such writings as the Bābur-nāma
diaries appear to be available for showing variation within
a year’s limit.</p>

<p>In 935 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> Bābur enters few full dates, <i>i.e.</i> days of the week
and month. Often he gives only the day of the week, the safest,
however, in a diary. He is precise in saying at what time of
the night or the day an action was done; this is useful not only
as helping to get over difficulties caused by minor losses of
text, but in the more general matter of the transference of
a Ḥijra night-and-day which begins after sunset, to its Julian
equivalent, of a day-and-night which begins at 12 a.m. This
sometimes difficult transference affords a probable explanation
of a good number of the discrepant dates found in Oriental-Occidental
books.</p>

<p>Two matters of difference between the Bābur-nāma dating
and that of some European calendars are as follows:<span class='pagenum'><a name="a_lxxi" id="a_lxxi">[Pg lxxi]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>a. Discrepancy as to the day of the week on which Muḥ. 935</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>
<i>began.</i></p>

<p>This discrepancy is not a trivial matter when a year’s diary
is concerned. The record of Muḥ. 1st and 2nd is missing from
the <i>Bābur-nāma</i>; Friday the 3rd day of Muḥarram is the first
day specified; the 1st was a Wednesday therefore. Erskine
accepted this day; Cunningham and W&uuml;stenfeld give Tuesday.
On three grounds Wednesday seems right&mdash;at any rate at that
period and place:&mdash;(1) The second Friday in Muḥarram was
‘Āshūr, the 10th (f. 240); (2) Wednesday is in serial order if
reckoning be made from the last surviving date of 934 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> with
due allowance of an intercalary day to Ẕū’l-ḥijja (Gladwin),
<i>i.e.</i> from Thursday Rajab 12th (April 2nd 1528 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span> f. 339, p. 602);
(3) Wednesday is supported by the daily record of far into the
year.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>b. Variation in the length of the months of 935</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span></p>

<p>There is singular variation between the <i>Bābur-nāma</i> and
W&uuml;stenfeld’s <i>Tables</i>, both as to the day of the week on which
months began, and as to the length of some months. This
variation is shown in the following table, where asterisks mark
agreement as to the days of the week, and the capital letters,
quoted from W.’s <i>Tables</i>, denote A, Sunday; B, Tuesday, <i>etc.</i>
(the bracketed names being of my entry).</p>

<p>The table shows that notwithstanding the discrepancy discussed
in section <i>a</i>, of Bābur’s making 935 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> begin on a
Wednesday, and W&uuml;stenfeld on a Tuesday, the two authorities
agree as to the initial week-day of four months out of twelve,
<i>viz.</i> Ṣafar, Sha‘bān, Shawwal and Ẕū’l-ḥijja.</p>

<p>Again:&mdash;In eight of the months the <i>Bābur-nāma</i> reverses
the “book-rule” of alternative Muḥarram 30 days, Ṣafar 29 days
<i>et seq.</i> by giving Muḥarram 29, Ṣafar 30. (This is seen readily
by following the initial days of the week.) Again:&mdash;these eight
months are in pairs having respectively 29 and 30 days, and the
year’s total is 364.&mdash;Four months follow the fixed rule, <i>i.e.</i> as
though the year had begun Muḥ. 30 days, Ṣafar 29 days&mdash;namely,
the two months of Rabī‘ and the two of Jumāda.&mdash;Ramẓān
to which under “book-rule” 30 days are due, had
29 days, because, as Bābur records, the Moon was seen on the
29th.&mdash;In the other three instances of the reversed 30 and 29,
one thing is common, <i>viz.</i> Muḥarram, Rajab, Ẕū’l-qa‘da (as also
Ẕū’l-ḥijja) are “honoured” months.&mdash;It would be interesting if
some expert in this Musalmān matter would give the reasons
dictating the changes from rule noted above as occurring in
935 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><i>c. Varia.</i></p>

<p>(1) On f. 367 Saturday is entered as the 1st day of Sha‘bān
and Wednesday as the 4th, but on f. 368<i>b</i> stands Wednesday 5th,
as suits the serial dating. If the mistake be not a mere slip, it
may be due to confusion of hours, the ceremony chronicled
being accomplished on the eve of the 5th, Anglicé, after sunset
on the 4th.</p>

<p>(2) A fragment only survives of the record of Ẕū’l-ḥijja
935 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> It contains a date, Thursday 7th, and mentions a Feast
which will be that of the <i>‘Īdu’l-kabīr</i> on the 10th (Sunday).
Working on from this to the first-mentioned day of 936 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> <i>viz.</i>
Tuesday, Muḥarram 3rd, the month (which is the second of a pair
having 29 and 30 days) is seen to have 30 days and so to fit on
to 936 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> The series is Sunday 10th, 17th, 24th (Sat. 30th)
Sunday 1st, Tuesday 3rd.<span class='pagenum'><a name="a_lxxiii" id="a_lxxiii">[Pg lxxiii]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="t" id="t"></a>T.&mdash;ON L:KNŪ (LAKHNAU) AND L:KNŪR
(LAKHNŪR, NOW SHĀHĀBĀD IN
RĀMPŪR).</h3>

<p>One or other of the above-mentioned names occurs eight times
in the <i>Bābur-nāma</i> (<i>s.a.</i> 932, 934, 935 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>), some instances being
shown by their context to represent Lakhnau in Oudh, others
inferentially and by the verbal agreement of the Ḥaidarābād
Codex and Kehr’s Codex to stand for Lakhnūr (now Shāhābād
in Rāmpūr). It is necessary to reconsider the identification of
those not decided by their context, both because there is so
much variation in the copies of the ‘Abdu’r-raḥīm Persian translation
that they give no verbal help, and because Mr. Erskine
and M. de Courteille are in agreement about them and took the
whole eight to represent Lakhnau. This they did on different
grounds, but in each case their agreement has behind it a defective
textual basis.&mdash;Mr. Erskine, as is well known, translated the
‘Abdu’r-raḥīm Persian text without access to the original Turkī
but, if he had had the Elphinstone Codex when translating,
it would have given him no help because all the eight instances
occur on folios not preserved by that codex. His only sources
were not-first-rate Persian MSS. in which he found casual
variation from terminal <i>nū</i> to <i>nūr</i>, which latter form may have
been read by him as <i>nūū</i> (whence perhaps the old Anglo-Indian
transliteration he uses, Luknow).<a name="FNanchor_2843" id="FNanchor_2843"></a><a href="#Footnote_2843" class="fnanchor">2843</a>&mdash;M. de Courteille’s position
is different; his uniform <i>Lakhnau</i> obeyed the same uniformity
in his source the Kāsān Imprint, and would appear to him the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="a_lxxiv" id="a_lxxiv">[Pg lxxiv]</a></span>more assured for the concurrence of the <i>Memoirs</i>. His textual
basis, however, for these words is Dr. Ilminsky’s and not Kehr’s.
No doubt the uniform <i>Lakhnū</i> of the Kāsān Imprint is the
result of Dr. Ilminsky’s uncertainty as to the accuracy of his
single Turkī archetype [Kehr’s MS.], and also of his acceptance of
Mr. Erskine’s uniform <i>Luknow</i>.<a name="FNanchor_2844" id="FNanchor_2844"></a><a href="#Footnote_2844" class="fnanchor">2844</a>&mdash;Since the Ḥaidarābād Codex
became available and its collation with Kehr’s Codex has been
made, a better basis for distinguishing between the L:knū and
L:knūr of the Persian MSS. has been obtained.<a name="FNanchor_2845" id="FNanchor_2845"></a><a href="#Footnote_2845" class="fnanchor">2845</a> The results of
the collation are entered in the following table, together with
what is found in the Kāsān Imprint and the <i>Memoirs</i>. [N.B. The

<p>The following notes give some grounds for accepting the
names as the two Turkī codices agree in giving them:&mdash;</p>

<p>The first and second instances of the above table, those of
the Ḥai. Codex f. 278<i>b</i> and f. 338, are shown by their context to
represent Lakhnau.</p>

<p>The third (f. 292<i>b</i>) is an item of Bābur’s Revenue List. The
Turkī codices are supported by B.M. Or. 1999, which is a direct
copy of Shaikh Zain’s autograph <i>T̤ābaqāt-i-bāburī</i>, all three
having L:knūr. Kehr’s MS. and Or. 1999 are descendants of
the second degree from the original List; that the Ḥai. Codex
is a direct copy is suggested by its pseudo-tabular arrangement
<span class='pagenum'><a name="a_lxxv" id="a_lxxv">[Pg lxxv]</a></span>of the various items.&mdash;An important consideration supporting
<i>L:knūr</i>, is that the List is in Persian and may reasonably be
accepted as the one furnished officially for the Pādshāh’s
information when he was writing his account of Hindūstān (cf.
Appendix P, p. liv). This official character disassociates it from
any such doubtful spelling by the foreign Pādshāh as cannot
but suggest itself when the variants of <i>e.g.</i> Dalmau and Bangarmau
are considered. L:knūr is what three persons copying
independently read in the official List, and so set down that
careful scribes <i>i.e.</i> Kehr and ‘Abdu’l-lāh (App. P) again wrote
L:knūr.<a name="FNanchor_2846" id="FNanchor_2846"></a><a href="#Footnote_2846" class="fnanchor">2846</a>&mdash;Another circumstance favouring L:knūr (Lakhnūr) is
that the place assigned to it in the List is its geographical one
between Saṃbhal and Khairābād.&mdash;Something for [or perhaps
against] accepting Lakhnūr as the <i>sarkār</i> of the List may be
known in local records or traditions. It had been an important
place, and later on it paid a large revenue to Akbar [as part of
Saṃbhal].&mdash;It appears to have been worth the attention of
Bīban <i>Jalwānī</i> (f. 329).&mdash;Another place is associated with L:knūr
in the Revenue List, the forms of which are open to a considerable
number of interpretations besides that of Baksar shown
<i>in loco</i> on p. 521. Only those well acquainted with the United
Provinces or their bye-gone history can offer useful suggestion
about it. Maps show a “Madkar” 6 m. south of old Lakhnūr;
there are in the United Provinces two Baksars and as many
other Lakhnūrs (none however being so suitable as what is now
Shāhābād). Perhaps in the archives of some old families there
may be help found to interpret the entry <i>L:knūr u B:ks:r</i> (var.),
a conjecture the less improbable that the <i>Gazetteer of the
Province of Oude</i> (ii, 58) mentions a <i>farmān</i> of Bābur Pādshāh’s
dated 1527 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span> and upholding a grant to Shaikh Qāẓī of Bīlgrām.</p>

<p>The fourth instance (f. 329) is fairly confirmed as Lakhnūr
by its context, <i>viz.</i> an officer received the district of Badāyūn
from the Pādshāh and was sent against Bīban who had laid
siege to L:knūr on which Badāyūn bordered.&mdash;At the time
Lakhnau may have been held from Bābur by Shaikh Bāyazīd</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="a_lxxvi" id="a_lxxvi">[Pg lxxvi]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Farmūlī</i> in conjunction with Aūd. Its estates are recorded as
still in Farmūlī possession, that of the widow of “Kala Pahār”
<i>Farmūlī</i>.&mdash;(<i>See infra.</i>)</p>

<p>The fifth instance (f. 334) connects with Aūd (Oudh) because
royal troops abandoning the place L:knū were those who had
been sent against Shaikh Bāyazīd in Aūd.</p>

<p>The remaining three instances (f. 376, f. 376<i>b</i>, f. 377<i>b</i>) appear
to concern one place, to which Bīban and Bāyazīd were
rumoured to intend going, which they captured and abandoned.
As the table of variants shows, Kehr’s MS. reads Lakhnūr in
all three places, the Ḥai. MS. once only, varying from itself as
it does in Nos. 1 and 2.&mdash;A circumstance supporting <i>Lakhnūr</i>
is that one of the messengers sent to Bābur with details of the
capture was the son of Shāh Muḥ. <i>Dīwāna</i> whose record associates
him rather with Badakhshān, and with Humāyūn and Saṃbhal
[perhaps with Lakhnūr itself] than with Bābur’s own army.&mdash;Supplementing
my notes on these three instances, much could
be said in favour of reading Lakhnūr, about time and distance
done by the messengers and by ‘Abdu’l-lah <i>kitābdār</i>, on his way
to Saṃbhal and passing near Lakhnūr; much too about the
various rumours and Bābur’s immediate counter-action. But
to go into it fully would need lengthy treatment which the
historical unimportance of the little problem appears not to
demand.&mdash;Against taking the place to be Lakhnau there are the
considerations (<i>a</i>) that Lakhnūr was the safer harbourage for
the Rains and less near the westward march of the royal troops
returning from the battle of the Goghrā; (<i>b</i>) that the fort of
Lakhnau was the renowned old Machchi-bawan (cf. <i>Gazetteer
of the Province of Oude</i>, 3 vols., 1877, ii, 366).&mdash;So far as I have
been able to fit dates and transactions together, there seems no
reason why the two Afghāns should not have gone to Lakhnūr,
have crossed the Ganges near it, dropped down south [perhaps
even intending to recross at Dalmau] with the intention of
getting back to the Farmūlīs and Jalwānīs perhaps in Sārwār,
perhaps elsewhere to Bāyazīd’s brother Ma‘rūf.</p>

<h3><a name="u" id="u"></a>U.&mdash;THE INSCRIPTIONS ON BĀBUR’S
MOSQUE IN AJODHYA (OUDH).</h3>

<p>Thanks to the kind response made by the Deputy-Commissioner
of Fyzābād to my husband’s enquiry about two
inscriptions mentioned by several Gazetteers as still existing
on “Bābur’s Mosque” in Oudh, I am able to quote copies of
both.<a name="FNanchor_2847" id="FNanchor_2847"></a><a href="#Footnote_2847" class="fnanchor">2847</a></p>

<p><i>a.</i> The inscription inside the Mosque is as follows:&mdash;</p>

follows:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_2848" id="FNanchor_2848"></a><a href="#Footnote_2848" class="fnanchor">2848</a></p>

<p>1. By the command of the Emperor Bābur whose justice is
an edifice reaching up to the very height of the heavens,</p>

<p>2. The good-hearted Mīr Bāqī built this alighting-place of
angels;<a name="FNanchor_2849" id="FNanchor_2849"></a><a href="#Footnote_2849" class="fnanchor">2849</a></p>

<p>3. <i>Bavad khāir bāqī!</i> (May this goodness last for ever!)<a name="FNanchor_2850" id="FNanchor_2850"></a><a href="#Footnote_2850" class="fnanchor">2850</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="a_lxxviii" id="a_lxxviii">[Pg lxxviii]</a></span></p>

<p>The year of building it was made clear likewise when I said,
<i>Buvad khair bāqī</i> ( = 935).<a name="FNanchor_2851" id="FNanchor_2851"></a><a href="#Footnote_2851" class="fnanchor">2851</a></p>

<p>The explanation of this is:&mdash;</p>

<p>1st couplet:&mdash;The poet begins by praising the Emperor Bābur
under whose orders the mosque was erected. As justice is the
(chief) virtue of kings, he naturally compares his (Bābur’s) justice
to a palace reaching up to the very heavens, signifying thereby
that the fame of that justice had not only spread in the wide
world but had gone up to the heavens.</p>

<p>2nd couplet:&mdash;In the second couplet, the poet tells who was
entrusted with the work of construction. M[i]r Bāqī was evidently
some nobleman of distinction at Bābur’s Court.&mdash;The noble
height, the pure religious atmosphere, and the scrupulous cleanliness
and neatness of the mosque are beautifully suggested by
saying that it was to be the abode of angels.</p>

<p>3rd couplet:&mdash;The third couplet begins and ends with the
expression <i>Buvad khair bāqī</i>. The letters forming it by their
numerical values represent the number 935, thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>The poet indirectly refers to a religious commandment
(<i>dictum</i>?) of the Qorān that a man’s good deeds live after his
death, and signifies that this noble mosque is verily such a one.</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>The explanation of the above is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the first couplet the poet praises God, in the second
Muḥammad, in the third Bābur.&mdash;There is a peculiar literary
beauty in the use of the word <i>lā-makānī</i> in the 1st couplet.
The author hints that the mosque is meant to be the abode of
God, although He has no fixed abiding-place.&mdash;In the first
hemistich of the 3rd couplet the poet gives Bābur the appellation
of <i>qalandar</i>, which means a perfect devotee, indifferent to all
worldly pleasures. In the second hemistich he gives as the reason
for his being so, that Bābur became and was known all the world
over as a <i>qalandar</i>, because having become Emperor of India
and having thus reached the summit of worldly success, he had
nothing to wish for on this earth.<a name="FNanchor_2853" id="FNanchor_2853"></a><a href="#Footnote_2853" class="fnanchor">2853</a></p>

<p>The inscription is incomplete and the above is the plain
interpretation which can be given to the couplets that are to
hand. Attempts may be made to read further meaning into
them but the language would not warrant it.</p>

<h3><a name="v" id="v"></a>V.&mdash;BĀBUR’S GARDENS IN AND NEAR
KĀBUL.</h3>

<p>The following particulars about gardens made by Bābur in or
near Kābul, are given in Muḥammad Amīr of Kazwīn’s <i>Pādshāh-nāma</i>
(Bib. Ind. ed. p. 585, p. 588).</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="a_lxxx" id="a_lxxx">[Pg lxxx]</a></span></p><p>Ten gardens are mentioned as made:&mdash;the Shahr-ārā (Town-adorning)
which when Shāh-i-jahān first visited Kābul in the
12th year of his reign (1048 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1638 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>) contained very fine
plane-trees Bābur had planted, beautiful trees having magnificent
trunks,<a name="FNanchor_2854" id="FNanchor_2854"></a><a href="#Footnote_2854" class="fnanchor">2854</a>&mdash;the Chār-bāgh,&mdash;the Bāgh-i-jalau-khāna,<a name="FNanchor_2855" id="FNanchor_2855"></a><a href="#Footnote_2855" class="fnanchor">2855</a>&mdash;the
Aūrta-bāgh (Middle-garden),&mdash;the Ṣaurat-bāgh,&mdash;the Bāgh-i-mahtāb
(Moonlight-garden),&mdash;the Bāgh-i-āhū-khāna (Garden-of-the-deer-house),&mdash;and
three smaller ones. Round these
gardens rough-cast walls were made (renewed?) by Jahāngīr
(1016 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>).</p>

<p>The above list does not specify the garden Bābur made and
selected for his burial; this is described apart (<i>l.c.</i> p. 588) with
details of its restoration and embellishment by Shāh-i-jahān
the master-builder of his time, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The burial-garden was 500 yards (<i>gaz</i>) long; its ground was
in 15 terraces, 30 yards apart(?). On the 15th terrace is the
tomb of Ruqaiya Sult̤ān Begam<a name="FNanchor_2856" id="FNanchor_2856"></a><a href="#Footnote_2856" class="fnanchor">2856</a>; as a small marble platform
(<i>chabūṭra</i>) had been made near it by Jahāngīr’s command, Shāh-i-jahān
ordered (both) to be enclosed by a marble screen
three yards high.&mdash;Bābur’s tomb is on the 14th terrace. In
accordance with his will, no building was erected over it, but
Shāh-i-jahān built a small marble mosque on the terrace below.<a name="FNanchor_2857" id="FNanchor_2857"></a><a href="#Footnote_2857" class="fnanchor">2857</a>
It was begun in the 17th year (of Shāh-i-jahān’s reign) and was
finished in the 19th, after the conquest of Balkh and Badakhshān,
at a cost of 30,000 <i>rūpīs</i>. It is admirably constructed.&mdash;From
the 12th terrace running-water flows along the line
(<i>rasta</i>) of the avenue;<a name="FNanchor_2858" id="FNanchor_2858"></a><a href="#Footnote_2858" class="fnanchor">2858</a> but its 12 water-falls, because not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="a_lxxxi" id="a_lxxxi">[Pg lxxxi]</a></span>constructed with cemented stone, had crumbled away and their
charm was lost; orders were given therefore to renew them
entirely and lastingly, to make a small reservoir below each fall,
and to finish with Kābul marble the edges of the channel and
the waterfalls, and the borders of the reservoirs.&mdash;And on the
9th terrace there was to be a reservoir 11 x 11 yards, bordered
with Kābul marble, and on the 10th terrace one 15 x 15, and
at the entrance to the garden another 15 x 15, also with a marble
border.&mdash;And there was to be a gateway adorned with gilded
cupolas befitting that place, and beyond (<i>pesh</i>) the gateway
a square station,<a name="FNanchor_2859" id="FNanchor_2859"></a><a href="#Footnote_2859" class="fnanchor">2859</a> one side of which should be the garden-wall
and the other three filled with cells; that running-water should
pass through the middle of it, so that the destitute and poor
people who might gather there should eat their food in those
cells, sheltered from the hardship of snow and rain.<a name="FNanchor_2860" id="FNanchor_2860"></a><a href="#Footnote_2860" class="fnanchor">2860</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_26" id="Footnote_26"></a><a href="#FNanchor_26"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> But for present difficulties of intercourse with Petrograd, I would
have re-examined with Kehr’s the collateral Codex of 1742 (copied in
1839 and now owned by the Petrograd University). It might be useful; as
Kehr’s volume has lost pages and may be disarranged here and there.
</p>
<p>
The list of Kehr’s items is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>1 (<i>not in the Imprint</i>). A letter from Babur to Kamran the date of
which is fixed as 1527 by its committing Ibrahim <i>Ludi’s</i> son to
Kamran’s charge (p. 544). It is heard of again in the Bukhara
Compilation, is lost from Kehr’s Codex, and preserved from his
archetype by Klaproth who translated it. Being thus found in Bukhara
in the first decade of the eighteenth century (our earliest
knowledge of the Compilation is 1709), the inference is allowed that
it went to Bukhara as loot from the defeated Kamran’s camp and that
an endorsement its companion Babur-nama (proper) bears was made by
the Auzbeg of two victors over Kamran, both of 1550, both in
Tramontana.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a>
</p><p>
2 (<i>not in Imp.</i>). Timur-pulad’s memo. about the purchase of his
Codex in cir. 1521 (<i>eo cap. post</i>).
</p><p>
3 (<i>Imp. 1</i>). Compiler’s Preface of Praise (JRAS. 1900, p. 474).
</p><p>
4 (<i>Imp. 2</i>). Babur’s Acts in Farghana, in diction such as to seem a
re-translation of the Persian translation of 1589. How much of
Kamran’s MS. was serviceable is not easy to decide, because the
Turki fettering of ‘Abdu’r-rahim’s Persian lends itself admirably to
re-translation.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a>
</p><p>
5 (<i>Imp. 3</i>). The “Rescue-passage” (App. D) attributable to
Jahangir.
</p><p>
6 (<i>Imp. 4</i>). Babur’s Acts in Kabul, seeming (like No. 4) a
re-translation or patching of tattered pages. There are also
passages taken verbatim from the Persian.
</p><p>
7 (<i>Imp. omits</i>). A short length of Babur’s Hindustan Section,
carefully shewn damaged by dots and dashes.
</p><p>
8 (<i>Imp. 5</i>). Within 7, the spurious passage of App. L and also
scattered passages about a feast, perhaps part of 7.
</p><p>
9 (<i>Imp. separates off at end of vol.</i>). Translated passage from the
<i>Akbar-nāma</i>, attributable to Jahangir, briefly telling of Kanwa
(1527), Babur’s latter years (both changed to first person), death
and court.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a>
</p><p>
[Babur’s history has been thus brought to an end, incomplete in the
balance needed of 7. In Kehr’s volume a few pages are left blank
except for what shews a Russian librarian’s opinion of the plan of
the book, “Here end the writings of Shah Babur.”]
</p><p>
10 (<i>Imp. omits</i>). Preface to the history of Humayun, beginning at
the Creation and descending by giant strides through notices of
Khans and Sultans to “Babur Mirza who was the father of Humayun
Padshah”. Of Babur what further is said connects with the battle of
Ghaj-davan (918-1512 <i>q.v.</i>). It is ill-informed, laying blame on
him as if he and not Najm Sani had commanded&mdash;speaks of his
preference for the counsel of young men and of the numbers of
combatants. It is noticeable for more than its inadequacy however;
its selection of the Ghaj-davan episode from all others in Babur’s
career supports circumstantially what is dealt with later, the
Ghaj-davani authorship of the Compilation.
</p><p>
11 (<i>Imp. omits</i>). Under a heading “Humayun Padshah” is a fragment
about (his? Accession) Feast, whether broken off by loss of his
pages or of those of his archetype examination of the P. Univ. Codex
may show.
</p><p>
12 (<i>Imp. 6</i>). An excellent copy of Babur’s Hindustan Section,
perhaps obtained from the Ahrari house. [This Ilminski places (I
think) where Kehr has No. 7.] From its position and from its bearing
a scribe’s date of completion (which Kehr brings over), <i>viz.</i> <i>Tamt
shud 1126</i> (Finished 1714), the compiler may have taken it for
Humayun’s, perhaps for the account of his reconquest of Hind in
1555.
</p><p>
[The remaining entries in Kehr’s volume are a quatrain which may
make jesting reference to his finished task, a librarian’s Russian
entry of the number of pages (831), and the words <i>Etablissement
Orientale, Fr. v. Adelung</i>, 1825 (the Director of the School from
1793).<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></p></div></div>

Ālmālīgh,&mdash;a Metropolitan see of the Nestorian Church in the 14th.

follow Turkī lettering because I am not competent to choose amongst
systems which <i>e.g.</i> here, reproduce Aūzbeg as Ūzbeg, &Ouml;zbeg and Euzbeg;
and (2) that style being part of an autobiography, I am compelled, in
pressing back the Memoirs on Bābur’s Turkī mould, to retract from the
wording of the western scholars, Erskine and de Courteille. Of this
compulsion Bābur’s bald phrase <i>Mughūl u Aūzbeg jihatdīn</i> provides an
illustration. Each earlier translator has expressed his meaning with
more finish than he himself; ‘Abdu’r-raḥīm, by <i>az jihat ‘ubūr-i</i>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_59" id="Footnote_59"></a><a href="#FNanchor_59"><span class="label">[59]</span></a> Most travellers into Farghāna comment on Bābur’s account
of it. One much discussed point is the position of the Barā Koh. The
personal observations of Ujfalvy and Schuyler led them to accept its
identification with the rocky ridge known as the Takht-i-sulaimān. I
venture to supplement this by the suggestion that Bābur, by Barā Koh,
did not mean the whole of the rocky ridge, the name of which,
Takht-i-sulaimān, an ancient name, must have been known to him, but one
only of its four marked summits. Writing of the ridge Madame Ujfalvy
says, “<i>Il y a quatre sommets dont le plus élevé est le troisi&egrave;me
comptant par le nord</i>.” Which summit in her sketch (p. 327) is the third
and highest is not certain, but one is so shewn that it may be the
third, may be the highest and, as being a peak, can be described as
symmetrical <i>i.e.</i> Bābur’s <i>mauzūn</i>. For this peak an appropriate name
would be Barā Koh.
</p><p>
If the name Barā Koh could be restricted to a single peak of the
Takht-i-sulaimān ridge, a good deal of earlier confusion would be
cleared away, concerning which have written, amongst others, Ritter (v,
432 and 732); Réclus (vi. 54); Schuyler (ii, 43) and those to whom these
three refer. For an excellent account, graphic with pen and pencil, of

not sure that he uses it always as a noun; he writes of a <i>Sārt kīshī</i>,
a Sārt person. His Asfara Sārts may have been Turkī-speaking settled

This is a puzzling passage. It seems to say that wind always goes east
and west from the steppe as from a generating centre. E. and de C. have
given it alternative directions, east or west, but there is little point
in saying this of wind in a valley hemmed in on the north and the south.
Bābur limits his statement to the steppe lying in the contracted mouth
of the Farghāna valley (<i>pace</i> Schuyler ii, 51) where special climatic
conditions exist such as (<i>a</i>) difference in temperature on the two
sides of the Khujand narrows and currents resulting from this
difference,&mdash;(<i>b</i>) the heating of the narrows by sun-heat reflected from
the Mogol-tau,&mdash;and (<i>c</i>) the inrush of westerly wind over Mīrzā Rabāt̤.
Local knowledge only can guide a translator safely but Bābur’s
directness of speech compels belief in the significance of his words and
this particularly when what he says is unexpected. He calls the Hā
Darwesh a whirling wind and this it still is. Thinkable at least it is
that a strong westerly current (the prevailing wind of Farghāna)
entering over Mīrzā Rabāt̤ and becoming, as it does become, the whirlwind
of Hā Darwesh on the hemmed-in steppe,&mdash;becoming so perhaps by conflict
with the hotter indraught through the Gates of Khujand&mdash;might force that
indraught back into the Khujand Narrows (in the way <i>e.g.</i> that one Nile
in flood forces back the other), and at Khujand create an easterly
current. All the manuscripts agree in writing to (<i>ghā</i>) Marghīnān and
to (<i>ghā</i>) Khujand. It may be observed that, looking at the map, it
appears somewhat strange that Bābur should take, for his wind objective,
a place so distant from his (defined) Hā Darwesh and seemingly so
screened by its near hills as is Marghīnān. But that westerly winds are
prevalent in Marghīnān is seen <i>e.g.</i> in Middendorff’s <i>Einblikke in den
Farghāna Thal</i> (p. 112). <i>Cf.</i> Réclus vi, 547; Schuyler ii, 51; Cahun’s

The “lambskins” of L. and E. carry on a notion of comfort started by
their having read <i>sayāh</i>, shelter, for Turkī <i>sā’ī</i>, torrent-bed; de C.
also lays stress on fur and warmth, but would not the flowery border of
a mountain stream prompt rather a phrase bespeaking ornament and beauty
than one expressing warmth and textile softness? If the phrase might be
read as <i>postīn pesh perā</i>, what adorns the front of a coat, or as
<i>postīn pesh bar rah</i>, the fine front of the coat, the phrase would
recall the gay embroidered front of some leathern postins.</p></div>

that the actual villages he names may not be those of Bābur’s Yītī-kint.

The rulers whose affairs are chronicled at length in the Farghāna
Section of the B.N. are, (I) of Tīmūrid Turks, (always styled Mīrzā),
(<i>a</i>) the three Mīrān-shāhī brothers, Aḥmad, Maḥmūd and ‘Umar Shaikh
with their successors, Bāī-sunghar, ‘Alī and Bābur; (<i>b</i>) the Bāī-qarā,
Ḥusain of Harāt: (II) of Chīngīz Khānīds, (always styled Khān,) (<i>a</i>)
the two Chaghatāī Mughūl brothers, Maḥmūd and Aḥmad; (<i>b</i>) the Shaibānid
Aūzbeg, Muḥammad Shaibānī (Shāh-i-bakht or Shaibāq or Shāhī Beg).
</p><p>
In electing to use the name <i>Shaibānī</i>, I follow not only the Ḥai. Codex
but also Shaibānī’s Boswell, Muḥammad Ṣāliḥ Mīrzā. The Elph. MS.
frequently uses <i>Shaibāq</i> but its authority down to f. 198 (Ḥai. MS. f.
243b) is not so great as it is after that folio, because not till f. 198
is it a direct copy of Bābur’s own. It may be more correct to write “the
Shaibānī Khān” and perhaps even “the Shaibānī.”</p></div>

It would have accorded with Bābur’s custom if here he had mentioned the
parentage of his father’s mother. Three times (fs. 17b, 70b, 96b) he
writes of “Shāh Sulṯan Begīm” in a way allowing her to be taken as ‘Umar
Shaikh’s own mother. Nowhere, however, does he mention her parentage.
One even cognate statement only have we discovered, <i>viz.</i> Khwānd-amīr’s
(Ḥ.S. ii, 192) that ‘Umar Shaikh was the own younger brother (<i>barādar
khurdtar khūd</i>) of Aḥmad and Maḥmūd. If his words mean that the three
were full-brothers, ‘Umar Shaikh’s own mother was Ābū-sa‘īd’s Tarkhān
wife. Bābur’s omission (f. 21b) to mention his father with A. and M. as
a nephew of Darwesh Muḥammad Tarkhān would be negative testimony against
taking Khwānd-amīr’s statement to mean “full-brother,” if clerical slips
were not easy and if Khwānd-amir’s means of information were less good.
He however both was the son of Maḥmūd’s wāzir (Ḥ.S. ii, 194) and
supplemented his book in Bābur’s presence.

To a statement made by the writer of the biographies included in Kehr’s

W.-i-B. by writing <i>aūltūrdī</i> (killed) where I suggest to read
<i>aūlnūrdī</i> (<i>devenir comme il faut</i>) state that Aḥmad killed Qātāq. I
hesitate to accept this (1) because the only evidence of the murder is
one diacritical point, the removal of which lifts Aḥmad’s reproach from
him by his return to the accepted rules of a polygamous household; (2)
because no murder of Qātāq is chronicled by Khwānd-amīr or other
writers; and (3) because it is incredible that a mild, weak man living
in a family atmosphere such as Bābur, Ḥaidar and Gul-badan reproduce for
us, should, while possessing facility for divorce, kill the mother of
four out of his five children.
</p><p>
Reprieve must wait however until the word <i>tīrīklīk</i> is considered. This
Erskine and de C. have read, with consistency, to mean <i>life-time</i>, but
if <i>aūlnūrdī</i> be read in place of <i>aūltūrdī</i> (killed), <i>tīrīklīk</i> may be
read, especially in conjunction with Bābur’s <i>‘āshīqlīklār</i>, as meaning
<i>living power</i> or <i>ascendancy</i>. Again, if read as from <i>tīrik</i>, a small
arrow and a consuming pain, <i>tīrīklīk</i> may represent Cupid’s darts and
wounds. Again it might be taken as from <i>tīrāmāk</i>, to hinder, or forbid.
</p><p>
Under these considerations, it is legitimate to reserve judgment on
Aḥmad.</p></div>

caution as a narrator. He appears to tell it as one who knowing the

habits were strange or that the envoy was an athlete but that both
things must have been (<i>īkān dūr</i>) from what he had heard or to suit the
point of the anecdote. Nor does he affirm as of his own knowledge that
Aūzbegs calls a strong man (his <i>zor kīshī</i>) a <i>būkuh</i> (bull) but says
it is so understood (<i>dīr īmīsh</i>).</p></div>

of mind</i>, an explanation fully illustrated in the B.N. The verb
describes fittingly the dainty, nervous action of some trained horses.

me that here and in other places, stress is laid by Bābur upon the
mutual gaze as an episode of a ceremonious interview. The verb
<i>kūrūshmak</i> is often rendered by the Persian translators as <i>daryāftan</i>
and by the L. and E. Memoirs as <i>to embrace</i>. I have not found in the
B.N. warrant for translating it as <i>to embrace</i>; <i>qūchūshmāq</i> is Bābur’s
word for this (f. 103). <i>Daryāftan</i>, taken as to grasp or see with the
mind, to understand, well expresses mutual gaze and its sequel of mutual
understanding. Sometimes of course, <i>kūrūsh</i>, the interview does not
imply <i>kūrūsh</i>, the silent looking in the eyes with mutual
understanding; it simply means <i>se voyer</i> <i>e.g.</i> f. 17. The point is
thus dwelt upon because the frequent mention of an embrace gives a
different impression of manners from that made by “interview” or words
expressing mutual gaze.</p></div>

heels. Out of this last meaning, I infer comes the one given by
dictionaries, “to sit at ease,” since the cross-legged posture is less
irksome than the genuflection, not to speak of the ease of mind produced
by honour received. <i>Cf.</i> f. 18b and note on Aḥmad’s posture; Redhouse

place stands at the mouth of a triply-bridged defile, but the name

Bābur’s. Bābur is obscure about what country was to be given to ‘Alī.
Pāyanda-ḥasan paraphrases his brief words;&mdash;Shaibānī was to be as a
father to ‘Alī and when he had taken ‘Alī’s father’s <i>wilāyāt</i>, he was
to give a country to ‘Alī. It has been thought that the gift to ‘Alī was
to follow Shaibānī’s recovery of his own ancestral camping-ground
(<i>yūrt</i>) but this is negatived, I think, by the word, <i>wilāyāt</i>,
cultivated land.</p></div>

(Four-doors) 18,900 ft. and Shibr-tū 9800 ft. In considering the labour
of their ascent and descent, the general high level, north and south of
them, should be borne in mind; <i>e.g.</i> Chārikār (Chār-yak-kār) stands
5200 ft. and Kābul itself at 5780 ft. above the sea.</p></div>

agrees with what is said of Shibr-tū pass as not crossing but turning
the Hindū-kush (Cunningham). Lord uses the same wording about the
Ḥājī-ghāt (var. -kāk etc.) traverse of the same spur, which “turns the

found no warrant, previous to Abū’l-faẓl’s, for calling the Indus the
Nīl-āb, and that to find one would solve an ancient geographical
difficulty. This difficulty, my husband suggests, was Alexander’s
supposition that the Indus was the Nile. In books grouping round the
<i>Bābur-nāma</i>, the name Nīl-āb is not applied to the Indus, but to the
ferry-station on that river, said to owe its name to a spring of azure
water on its eastern side. (Cf. Afẓal Khān <i>Khattak</i>, R.’s <i>Notes</i> p.
447.)
</p><p>
I find the name Nīl-āb applied to the Kābul-river:&mdash;1. to its Arghandī
affluent (Cunningham, p. 17, Map); 2. through its boatman class, the
Nīl-ābīs of Lālpūra, Jalālābād and Kūnār (G. of I. 1907, art. Kābul); 3.
inferentially to it as a tributary of the Indus (D’Herbélot); 4. to it
near its confluence with the grey, silt-laden Indus, as blue by contrast
(Sayyid Ghulām-i-muḥammad, R.’s <i>Notes</i> p. 34). (For Nīl-āb (Naulibis?)

component, whatever its form, is usually taken to mean <i>pass</i>, but to
read it here as pass would be redundant, since Bābur writes “pass
(<i>kūtal</i>) of Bād-i-pīch”. Pich occurs as a place name both east (Pīch)
and west (Pīchghān) of the <i>kūtal</i>, but what would suit the bitter and
even fatal winds of the pass would be to read the name as Whirling-wind
(<i>bād-i-pīch</i>). Another explanation suggests itself from finding a
considerable number of pass-names such as Shibr-tū, Jāi-tū, Qarā-tū, in
which <i>tū</i> is a synonym of <i>pīch</i>, turn, twist; thus Bād-i-pīch may be
the local form of Bād-tū, Windy-turn.</p></div>

about that this saint, one honoured in Kashmīr, was buried in Khutlān.
He died in Hazāra (Paklī) and there the Paklī Sult̤ān wished to have him
buried, but his disciples, for some unspecified reason, wished to bury
him in Khutlān. In order to decide the matter they invited the Sultān to
remove the bier with the corpse upon it. It could not be stirred from
its place. When, however, a single one of the disciples tried to move
it, he alone was able to lift it, and to bear it away on his head. Hence
the burial in Khutlān. The death occurred in 786 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH</span>. (1384 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD</span>.). A point
of interest in this legend is that, like the one to follow, concerning
dead women, it shews belief in the living activities of the dead.</p></div>

were found to link to the Turkī verb <i>chaqmāq</i>, to go out, because it
lies in the mouth of a defile (Dahānah-i-koh, Mountain-mouth) through
which the road for Kāfiristān goes out past the village. A
not-infrequent explanation of the name to mean White-house, Āq-sarāī,
may well be questioned. <i>Chaghān</i>, white, is Mughūlī and it would be
less probable for a Mughūlī than for a Turkī name to establish itself.
Another explanation may lie in the tribe name Chugānī. The two forms
<i>chaghān</i> and <i>chaghār</i> may well be due to the common local interchange
in speech of <i>n</i> with <i>r</i>. (For Dahānah-i-koh <i>see</i> [some] maps and

difficult to direct a missile so light as an arrow without the added
energy of the bow. The arrow itself will often have found its billet in

robbers of Khusrau Shāh’s former following. He cannot be taken as having

That Bābur should have given his laborious account of the Court of Herī
seems due both to loyalty to a great Tīmūrid, seated in Tīmūr Beg’s
place (f. 122b), and to his own interest, as a man-of-letters and
connoisseur in excellence, in that ruler’s galaxy of talent. His account
here opening is not complete; its sources are various; they include the
<i>Ḥabību’s-siyār</i> and what he will have learned himself in Herī or from
members of the Bāī-qarā family, knowledgeable women some of them, who
were with him in Hindūstān. The narrow scope of my notes shews that they
attempt no more than to indicate further sources of information and to

15lbs (Wollaston). The weight seems likely to refer to the strength
demanded for rounding the bow (<i>kamān guroha-sī</i>) <i>i.e.</i> as much
strength as to lift 40 <i>bātmāns</i>. Rounding or bending might stand for
stringing or drawing. The meaning can hardly be one of the weight of the
cross-bow itself. Erskine read <i>gūrdehieh</i> for <i>guroha</i> (p. 180) and
translated by “double-stringed bow”; de Courteille (i, 373) read
<i>guirdhiyeh, arrondi, circulaire</i>, in this following Ilminsky who may
have followed Erskine. The Elph. and Ḥai. MSS. and the first W.-i-B.

‘Āqil Sl. <i>Aūzbeg</i> (A.N. index <i>s.n.</i>). Several matters suggest that
these men were of the Shabān Aūzbegs who intermarried with Ḥusain
<i>Bāī-qarā’s</i> family and some of whom went to Bābur in Hindūstān. One
such matter is that Kābul was the refuge of dispossessed Harātīs, after
the Aūzbeg conquest; that there ‘Āqil married Shād <i>Bāī-qarā</i> and that
‘Ādil went on to Bābur. Moreover Khāfī Khān makes a statement which (if
correct) would allow ‘Ādil’s father Mahdī to be a grandson of Ḥusain
<i>Bāī-qarā</i>; this statement is that when Bābur defeated the Aūzbegs in
916 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (1510 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>), he freed from their captivity two sons (descendants)
of his paternal uncle, named Mahdī Sl. and Sult̤ān Mīrzā. [Leaving the
authenticity of the statement aside for a moment, it will be observed
that this incident is of the same date and place as another well-vouched
for, namely that Bābur then and there killed Mahdī Sl. <i>Aūzbeg</i> and
Ḥamza Sl. <i>Aūzbeg</i> after defeating them.] What makes in favour of Khāfī
Khān’s correctness is, not only that Bābur’s foe Mahdī is not known to
have had a son ‘Ādil, but also that his “Sulṯān Mīrzā” is not a style so
certainly suiting Ḥamza as it does a Shabān sult̤ān, one whose father was
a Shabān sult̤ān, and whose mother was a Mīrzā’s daughter. Moreover this
point of identification is pressed by the correctness, according to
oriental statement of relationship, of Khāfī Khān’s “paternal uncle” (of
Bābur), because this precisely suits Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā with whose family
these Shabān sult̤āns allied themselves. On the other hand it must be
said that Khāfī Khān’s statement is not in the English text of the
<i>Tārīkh-i-rashīdī</i>, the book on which he mostly relies at this period,
nor is it in my husband’s MS. [a copy from the Rampūr Codex]; and to
this must be added the verbal objection that a modicum of rhetoric
allows a death to be described both in Turkī and Persian, as a release
from the captivity of a sinner’s own acts (f. 160). Still Khāfī Khān may
be right; his statement may yet be found in some other MS. of the T. R.
or some different source; it is one a scribe copying the T. R. might be
led to omit by reason of its coincidences. The killing and the release
may both be right; ‘Ādil’s Mahdī may be the Shabān sult̤ān inference
makes him seem. This little <i>crux</i> presses home the need of much
attention to the <i>lacunæ</i> in the <i>Bābur-nāma</i>, since in them are lost
some exits and some entries of Bābur’s <i>dramatis personæ</i>, pertinently,
mention of the death of Mahdī with Ḥamza in 916 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>, and possibly also
that of ‘Ādil’s Mahdī’s release.</p></div>

Begīm Sult̤ān (a frequent title), married to Abā-bikr <i>Mīrān-shāhī</i> (who

explained by considering the following details; he left Herī hastily (f.

(June 23rd) in the Ravens'-garden. Here what Bābur says is that the

“What was the source of his own income?” Up to 873 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> he was for some

contradicting M. Belin’s view that vested property such as can be
described as “paternal inheritance”, may have passed from father to son,
even in those days of fugitive prosperity and changing appointments, one

attendants of his day, Kamālu’d-dīn Ḥusain <i>Gāzur-gāhī</i>. Mohan Lall
describes it as he saw it in 1831; says the original name of the
locality was Kār-zār-gāh, place-of-battle; and, as perhaps his most
interesting detail, mentions that Jalālu’d-dīn <i>Rūmī’s Maṣnawī</i> was
recited every morning near the tomb and that people fainted during the
invocation (<i>Travels in the Panj-āb</i> etc. p. 252). Colonel Yate has
described the tomb as he saw it some 50 years later (JASB 1887); and
explains the name Gāzur-gāh (lit. bleaching-place) by the following
words of an inscription there found; “His tomb (Anṣarī’s) is a
washing-place (<i>gāzur-gāh</i>) wherein the cloud of the Divine forgiveness
washes white the black records of men” (p. 88 and p. 102).</p></div>

the Turkī Codices, doubt cannot but be felt as to their authenticity.
They do not fit verbally to the sentence they follow; they are a unique
departure from Bābur’s plain prose narrative and nothing in the small
Hazāra affair shews cause for such departure; they differ from his usual
topics in their bombast and comment on his men (<i>cf.</i> f. 194 for comment
on shirking begs). They appear in the 2nd Persian translation (217 f.
134) in Turkī followed by a prose Persian rendering (<i>khalāṣa</i>). They
are not with the 1st Pers. trs. (215 f. 159), the text of which runs on
with a plain prose account suiting the size of the affair, as
follows:&mdash;“The braves, seeing their (the Hazāras) good soldiering, had
stopped surprised; wishing to hurry them i went swiftly past them,
shouting ‘Move on! move on!’ They paid me no attention. When, in order
to help, I myself attacked, dismounting and going up the hill, they
shewed courage and emulation in following. Getting to the top of the
pass, we drove that band off, killing many, capturing others, making
their families prisoner and plundering their goods.” This is followed by
“I myself collected” <i>etc.</i> as in the Turkī text after the verse. It
will be seen that the above extract is not a translation of the verse;
no translator or even summariser would be likely to omit so much of his
original. It is just a suitably plain account of a trivial matter.</p></div>

account that his own father was one of the rebels let go to the mercy of
the “avenging servitor”. When he writes of Bābur, as being, at a time so
provoking, gay, generous, affectionate, simple and gentle, he sets
before us insight and temper in tune with Kipling’s “If....”</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1241" id="Footnote_1241"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1241"><span class="label">[1241]</span></a> Bābur’s distinction, made here and elsewhere, between
Chaghatāī and Mughūl touches the old topic of the right or wrong of the
term “Mughūl dynasty”. What he, as also Ḥaidar, allows said is that if
Bābur were to describe his mother in tribal terms, he would say she was
half-Chaghatāī, half-Mughūl; and that if he so described himself, he
would say he was half-Tīmūrid-Turk, half-Chaghatāī. He might have called
the dynasty he founded in India Turkī, might have called it Tīmūriya; he
would never have called it Mughūl, after his maternal grandmother.
</p><p>
Ḥaidar, with imperfect classification, divides Chīngīz Khān’s “Mughūl
horde” into Mughūls and Chaghatāīs and of this Chaghatāī offtake says
that none remained in 953 <i>AH.</i> (1547 <i>AD.</i>) except the rulers, <i>i.e.</i>
sons of Sl. Aḥmad Khan (T.R. 148). Manifestly there was a body of
Chaghatāīs with Bābur and there appear to have been many near his day in
the Herī region,&mdash;‘Alī-sher <i>Nawā‘i</i> the best known.
</p><p>
Bābur supplies directions for naming his dynasty when, as several times,
he claims to rule in Hindūstān where the “Turk” had ruled (f. 233<i>b</i>, f.
224<i>b</i>, f. 225). To call his dynasty Mughūl seems to blot out the
centuries, something as we should do by calling the English Teutons. If
there is to be such blotting-out, Abū’l-ghāzī would allow us, by his
tables of Turk descent, to go further, to the primal source of all the
tribes concerned, to Turk, son of Japhet. This traditional descent is
another argument against “Mughūl dynasty.”</p></div>

re-marriage by Ḥ.S. iii, 359. The passage, a somewhat rhetorical one,
gives the following details:&mdash;“On coming into Herī on Muḥarram 11th,
Shaibānī at once set about gathering in the property of the Tīmūrids. He
had the wives and daughters of the former rulers brought before him. The
great lady Khān-zāda Begīm (f. 163<i>b</i>) who was daughter of Aḥmad Khān,
niece of Sl. Ḥusain Mīrzā, and wife of Muz̤affar Mīrzā, shewed herself
pleased in his presence. Desiring to marry him, she said Muz̤affar M.
had divorced her two years before. Trustworthy persons gave evidence to
the same effect, so she was united to Shaibānī in accordance with the
glorious Law. Mihr-angez Begīm, Muẓaffar M.’s daughter, was married to
‘Ubaidu’llāh Sl. (<i>Aūzbeg</i>); the rest of the chaste ladies having been
sent back into the city, Shaibānī resumed his search for property.”
Manifestly Bābur did not believe in the divorce Khwānd-amīr thus
records.</p></div>

between the departure of the two rebels from Kābul (f. 201<i>b</i>-202) and

only to the style but to the kind of paper on which a letter is written,
the place of signature, the place of the seal, and the situation of the
address. Chardin gives some curious information on the subject
(Erskine). Bābur marks the distinction of rank he drew between the
Arghūn chiefs and himself when he calls their letter to him,
<i>‘arẓ-dāsht</i>, his to them <i>khat̤t̤</i>. His claim to suzerainty over those
chiefs is shewn by Ḥaidar Mīrzā to be based on his accession to Tīmūrid
headship through the downfall of the Bāī-qarās, who had been the
acknowledged suzerains of the Arghūns now repudiating Bābur’s claim. Cf.

The end of the 280 mile march, from Kābul to within sight of Qandahār,
will have stirred in the General of 1507 what it stirred in the General
of 1880. Lord Roberts speaking in May 1913 in Glasgow on the rapid
progress of the movement for National Service thus spoke:&mdash;“A memory
comes over me which turns misgiving into hope and apprehension into
confidence. It is the memory of the morning when, accompanied by two of
Scotland’s most famous regiments, the Seaforths and the Gordons, at the
end of a long and arduous march, <i>I saw in the distance the walls and
minarets of Qandahar, and knew that the end of a great resolve and a

of supremacy at this particular time. He was the only Tīmūrid ruler and
man of achievement; he filled Ḥusain <i>Bāī-qarā</i>’s place of Tīmūrid
headship; his actions through a long period show that he aimed at
filling Tīmūr Beg’s. There were those who did not admit his
suzerainty,&mdash;Tīmūrids who had rebelled, Mughūls who had helped them, and
who would also have helped Sa‘īd Khān <i>Chaghatāī</i>, if he had not refused
to be treacherous to a benefactor; there were also the Arghūns,
Chīngīz-khānids of high pretensions. In old times the Mughūl Khāqāns
were <i>pādshāh</i> (supreme); Pādshāh is recorded in history as the style of
at least Sātūq-būghra Khān Pādshāh Ghāzī; no Tīmūrid had been lifted by
his style above all Mīrzās. When however Tīmūrids had the upper hand,
Bābur’s Tīmūrid grandfather Abū-sa‘īd asserted his <i>de facto</i> supremacy
over Bābur’s Chaghatāī grandfather Yūnas (T. R. p. 83). For Bābur to
re-assert that supremacy by assuming the Khāqān’s style was highly
opportune at this moment. To be Bābur Supreme was to declare
over-lordship above Chaghatāī and Mughūl, as well as over all Mīrzās. It
was done when his sky had cleared; Mīrzā Khān’s rebellion was scotched;
the Arghūns were defeated; he was the stronger for their lost
possessions; his Aūzbeg foe had removed to a less ominous distance; and
Kābul was once more his own.

position:&mdash;In the previous year he had been left in charge of Kābul when
Bābur went eastward in dread of Shaibānī, and, so left, occupied his
hereditary place. He cannot have hoped to hold Kābul if the Aūzbeg
attacked it; for its safety and his own he may have relied, and Bābur
also in appointing him, upon influence his Arghūn connections could use.
For these, one was Muqim his brother-in-law, had accepted Shaibānī’s
suzerainty after being defeated in Qandahār by Bābur. It suited them
better no doubt to have the younger Mīrzā rather than Bābur in Kābul;
the latter’s return thither will have disappointed them and the Mīrzā;
they, as will be instanced later, stood ready to invade his lands when
he moved East; they seem likely to have promoted the present Mughūl
uprising. In the battle which put this down, the Mīrzā was captured;
Bābur pardoned him; but he having rebelled again, was then put to
death.</p></div>

Muḥammad <i>Khukandī’s Tārīkh-i-shāhrukhī</i> (Kazan, 1885) and Nalivkine’s
<i>Khānate of Khokand</i> (p. 63). It says that when Bābur in 918 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (1512
<span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>) left Samarkand after defeat by the Aūzbegs, one of his wives,
Sayyida Āfāq who accompanied him in his flight, gave birth to a son in
the desert which lies between Khujand and Kand-i-badām; that Bābur, not
daring to tarry and the infant being too young to make the impending
journey, left it under some bushes with his own girdle round it in which
were things of price; that the child was found by local people and in
allusion to the valuables amongst which it lay, called Altūn bīshik
(golden cradle); that it received other names and was best known in
later life as Kḥudāyān Sult̤ān. He is said to have spent most of his life
in Akhsī; to have had a son Tīngrī-yār; and to have died in 952 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>
(1545 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>). His grandson Yār-i-muḥammad is said to have gone to India to
relations who was descendants of Bābur (JASB 1905 p. 137 H. Beveridge’s
art. <i>The Emperor Bābur</i>). What is against the truth of this tradition
is that Gul-badan mentions no such wife as Sayyida Āfāq. Māhīm however
seems to have belonged to a religious family, might therefore be styled
Sayyida, and, as Bābur mentions (f. 220), had several children who did
not live (a child left as this infant was, might if not heard of, be
supposed dead). There is this opening allowed for considering the
tradition.</p></div>

at Ḥiṣār and in the attack there made on Bābur; they are known from
Ḥaidar to have been done at Ghaznī; both times fall within this present

The year 925 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> opens with Bābur far from Kābul and east of the Khahr
(fort) he is about to attack. Afghān and other sources allow surmise of
his route to that position; he may have come down into the
Chandāwal-valley, first, from taking Chaghān-sarāī (f. 124, f. 134 and
n.), and, secondly, from taking the Gibrī stronghold of Ḥaidar-i-‘alī
<i>Bajaurī</i> which stood at the head of the Bābā Qarā-valley. The latter
surmise is supported by the romantic tales of Afghān chroniclers which
at this date bring into history Bābur’s Afghān wife, Bībī Mubāraka (f.
220<i>b</i> and note; Mems. p. 250 n.; and Appendix K, <i>An Afghān legend</i>).
(It must be observed here that R.’s <i>Notes</i> (pp. 117, 128) confuse the
two sieges, <i>viz.</i> of the Gibrī fort in 924 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> and of the Khahr of
Bajaur in 925 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>)</p></div>

Bābur now attacks has never been known as Bajaur, but always simply as

use of gun-powder in the East. There is, however, no well-authenticated
fact to prove the existence of anything like artillery there, till it
was introduced from Europe. Bābur here, and in other places (f. 267)
calls his larger ordnance Firingī, a proof that they were then regarded
as owing their origin to Europe. The Turks, in consequence of their
constant intercourse with the nations of the West, have always excelled
all the other Orientals in the use of artillery; and, when heavy cannon
were first used in India, Europeans or Turks were engaged to serve them
(Erskine). It is owing no doubt to the preceding gap in his writings
that we are deprived of Bābur’s account of his own introduction to
fire-arms. <i>See</i> E. &amp; D.’s <i>History of India</i>, vi, Appendix <i>On the

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1370" id="Footnote_1370"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1370"><span class="label">[1370]</span></a> This statement, the first we have, that Bābur has broken
Musalmān Law against stimulants (f. 49 and n.), is followed by many
others more explicit, jotting down where and what and sometimes why he
drank, in a way which arrests attention and asks some other explanation
than that it is an unabashed record of conviviality such conceivably as
a non-Musalmān might write. Bābur is now 37 years old; he had obeyed the
Law till past early manhood; he wished to return to obedience at 40; he
frequently mentions his lapses by a word which can be translated as
“commitment of sin” (<i>irtqāb</i>); one gathers that he did not at any time
disobey with easy conscience. Does it explain his singular record,&mdash;one
made in what amongst ourselves would be regarded as a private
diary,&mdash;that his sins were created by Law? Had he a balance of
reparation in his thoughts?
</p><p>
Detaching into their separate class as excesses, all his instances of
confessed drunkenness, there remains much in his record which, seen from
a non-Musalmān point of view, is venial; <i>e.g.</i> his <i>ṣubūhī</i> appears to
be the “morning” of the Scot, the <i>Morgen-trank</i> of the Teuton; his
afternoon cup, in the open air usually, may have been no worse than the
sober glass of beer or local wine of modern Continental Europe. Many of
these legal sins of his record were interludes in the day’s long ride,
stirrup-cups some of them, all in a period of strenuous physical
activity. Many of his records are collective and are phrased
impersonally; they mention that there was drinking, drunkenness even,
but they give details sometimes such as only a sober observer could
include.
</p><p>
Bābur names a few men as drunkards, a few as entirely obedient; most of
his men seem not to have obeyed the Law and may have been “temperate
drinkers”; they effected work, Bābur amongst them, which habitual
drunkards could not have compassed. Spite of all he writes of his worst
excesses, it must be just to remember his Musalmān conscience, and also
the distorting power of a fictitious sin. Though he broke the law
binding all men against excess, and this on several confessed occasions,
his rule may have been no worse than that of the ordinarily temperate
Western. It cannot but lighten judgment that his recorded lapses from
Law were often prompted by the bounty and splendour of Nature; were
committed amidst the falling petals of fruit-blossom, the flaming fire
of autumn leaves, where the eye rested on the <i>arghwān</i> or the orange
grove, the coloured harvest of corn or vine.</p></div>

Samarkand (T.R. p. 265). The last time Bābur came from Khwāst to Kābul
was probably in 920 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>; if later, it was still in the gap. But an
alternative explanation is that looking over and annotating the diary
section, Bābur made this reference to what he fully meant to write but
died before being able to do so.</p></div>

A considerable amount of reliable textual material for revising the
Hindūstān section of the English translation of the <i>Bābur-nāma</i> is
wanting through loss of pages from the Elphinstone Codex; in one
instance no less than an equivalent of 36 folios of the Ḥaidarābād Codex
are missing (f. 356 <i>et seq.</i>), but to set against this loss there is
the valuable <i>per contra</i> that Kehr’s manuscript throughout the section
becomes of substantial value, losing its Persified character and
approximating closely to the true text of the Elphinstone and Ḥaidarābād
Codices. Collateral help in revision is given by the works specified
(<i>in loco</i> p. 428) as serving to fill the gap existing in Bābur’s
narrative previous to 932 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> and this notably by those described by
Elliot and Dowson. Of these last, special help in supplementary details
is given for 932 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> and part of 933 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> by Shaikh Zain [<i>Khawāfi</i>]’s
<i>T̤abaqāt-i-bāburī</i>, which is a highly rhetorical paraphrase of Bābur’s
narrative, requiring familiarity with ornate Persian to understand. For
all my references to it, I am indebted to my husband. It may be
mentioned as an interesting circumstance that the B.M. possesses in Or.
1999 a copy of this work which was transcribed in 998 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> by one of
Khwānd-amīr’s grandsons and, judging from its date, presumably for
Abū’l-faẓl’s use in the <i>Akbar-nāma</i>.
</p><p>
Like part of the Kābul section, the Hindūstān one is in diary-form, but
it is still more heavily surcharged with matter entered at a date later
than the diary. It departs from the style of the preceding diary by an
occasional lapse into courtly phrase and by exchange of some Turkī words
for Arabic and Persian ones, doubtless found current in Hind, <i>e.g.</i>
<i>fauj</i>, <i>dīra</i>, <i>manzil</i>, <i>khail-khāna</i>.</p></div>

to mean a gift (N. et E. xiv, 119 n.) but here <i>muḥaqqar saughāt</i>
expresses gift. Another meaning can be assigned to <i>bīlāk</i> here, [one
had also by <i>tīlāk</i>,] <i>viz.</i> that of word-of-mouth news or
communication, sometimes supplementing written communication, possibly
secret instructions, possibly small domestic details. In <i>bīlāk</i>, a
gift, the root may be <i>bīl</i>, the act of knowing, in <i>tīlāk</i> it is <i>tīl</i>,
the act of speaking [whence <i>tīl</i>, the tongue, and <i>tīl tūtmāk</i>, to get
news]. In the sentence noted, either word would suit for a verbal
communication. Returning to <i>bīlāk</i> as a gift, it may express the
<i>nuance</i> of English <i>token</i>, the maker-known of friendship, affection
and so-on. This differentiates <i>bīlāk</i> from <i>saughāt</i>, used in its
frequent sense of ceremonial and diplomatic presents of value and

Būt-khāk, the road passes what in the thirties of the 19th Century, was
locally known as Bābur Pādshāh’s Stone-heap (cairn) and believed piled
in obedience to Bābur’s order that each man in his army should drop a
stone on it in passing. No time for raising such a monument could be

of Humāyūn’s about his delay; it has been expunged from the text but is
still fairly legible:&mdash;“The time fixed was after ‘Āshūrā (10th Muḥarram,
a voluntary fast); although we arrived after the next-following 10th
(<i>‘āshūr</i>, <i>i.e.</i> of Ṣafar), the delay had been necessary. The purpose
of the letters (Bābur’s) was to get information; (in reply) it was
represented that the equipment of the army of Badakhshān caused delay.
If this slave (Humāyūn), trusting to his [father’s] kindness, caused
further delay, he has been sorry.”
</p><p>
Bābur’s march from the Bāgh-i-wafā was delayed about a month; Humāyūn
started late from Badakhshān; his force may have needed some stay in
Kābul for completion of equipment; his personal share of blame for which
he counted on his father’s forgiveness, is likely to have been connected
with his mother’s presence in Kābul.
</p><p>
Humāyūn’s note is quoted in Turkī by one MS. of the Persian text (B.M.
W.-i-B. 16,623 f. 128); and from certain indications in Muḥammad
<i>Shīrāzī</i>’s lithograph (p. 163), appears to be in his archetype the

is wanted is an illustration of two incompatible things. Bābur’s
reflections [<i>infra</i>] condemned his verse. Shaikh Zain describes the
whole episode of the verse-making on the raft, and goes on with, “He
(Bābur) excised this choice couplet from the pages of his Acts
(<i>Wāqi‘āt</i>) with the knife of censure, and scratched it out from the
tablets of his noble heart with the finger-nails of repentance. I shall
now give an account of this spiritual matter” (<i>i.e.</i> the repentance),
“by presenting the recantations of his Solomon-like Majesty in his very
own words, which are weightier than any from the lips of Aesop.” Shaikh
Zain next quotes the Turkī passage here translated in <i>b. Mention of the
Mubīn</i>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1583" id="Footnote_1583"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1583"><span class="label">[1583]</span></a> The <i>Mubīn</i> (<i>q.v.</i> Index) is mentioned again and quoted

de Courteille, who here took it for <i>mīn</i>, I, and on f. 351<i>b</i> omitted
it, matters of which the obvious cause is that both translators were
less familiar with the poem than it is now easy to be. There is amplest
textual warrant for reading <i>Mubīn</i> in both the places indicated above;
its reinstatement gives to the English and French translations what they
have needed, namely, the clinch of a definite stimulus and date of
repentance, which was the influence of the Mubīn in 928 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (1521-2
<span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>). The whole passage about the peccant verse and its fruit of
contrition should be read with others that express the same regret for
broken law and may all have been added to the diary at the same time,
probably in 935 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (1529 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>). They will be found grouped in the Index

made Buhlūlpūr a royal domain (B.M. Add. 26,202 f. 16), but this does
not agree with Bābur’s explanation that he visited the place because it
was <i>khalṣa</i>. Its name suggests that it had belonged to Buhlūl <i>Lūdī</i>;
Bābur may have taken it in 930 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> when he captured Sīālkot. It never
received the population of Sīālkot, as Bābur had planned it should do
because pond-water was drunk in the latter town and was a source of
disease. The words in which Bābur describes its situation are those he
uses of Akhsī (f. 4<i>b</i>); not improbably a resemblance inclined his
liking towards Buhlūlpūr. (It may be noted that this Buhlūlpūr is
mentioned in the <i>Āyīn-i-akbarī</i> and marked on large maps, but is not
found in the G. of I. 1907.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1607" id="Footnote_1607"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1607"><span class="label">[1607]</span></a> Both names are thus spelled in the <i>Bābur-nāma</i>. In view
of the inclination of Turkī to long vowels, Bābur’s short one in Jat may
be worth consideration since modern usage of Jat and Jāt varies. Mr.
Crooke writes the full vowel, and mentions that Jāts are Hindūs, Sikhs,
and Muḥammadans (<i>Tribes and Castes of the North-western Provinces and
Oude</i>, iii, 38). On this point and on the orthography of the name,
Erskine’s note (<i>Memoirs</i> p. 294) is as follows: “The Jets or Jats are
the Muḥammadan peasantry of the Panj-āb, the bank of the Indus, Sīwīstān
<i>etc.</i> and must not be confounded with the Jāts, a powerful Hindū tribe
to the west of the Jamna, about Agra <i>etc.</i> and which occupies a
subordinate position in the country of the Rājpūts.”</p></div>

diary summarizing the action of ‘Ālam Khān before and after Bābur heard
of the defeat from the trader he mentions. It refutes an opinion found
here and there in European writings that Bābur used and threw over ‘Ālam
Khān. It and Bābur’s further narrative shew that ‘Ālam Khān had little
valid backing in Hindūstān, that he contributed nothing to Bābur’s
success, and that no abstention by Bābur from attack on Ibrāhīm would
have set ‘Ālam Khān on the throne of Dihlī. It and other records,
Bābur’s and those of Afghān chroniclers, allow it to be said that if
‘Ālam Khān had been strong enough to accomplish his share of the compact
that he should take and should rule Dihlī, Bābur would have kept to his
share, namely, would have maintained supremacy in the Panj-āb. He
advanced against Ibrāhīm only when ‘Ālam Khān had totally failed in arms
and in securing adherence.</p></div>

The <i>Bābur-nāma</i> makes no mention of Daulat Khān’s relations with Nānak,
the founder of the Sikh religion, nor does it mention Nānak himself. A
tradition exists that Nānak, when on his travels, made exposition of his
doctrines to an attentive Bābur and that he was partly instrumental in
bringing Bābur against the Afghāns. He was 12 years older than Bābur and
survived him nine. (Cf. <i>Dabistān</i> lith. ed. p. 270; and, for Jahāngīr

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1642" id="Footnote_1642"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1642"><span class="label">[1642]</span></a> There are two readings of this sentence; Erskine’s
implies that the neck of land connecting the fort-rock with its adjacent
hill measures 7-8 <i>qārī</i> (yards) from side to side; de Courteille’s that
where the great gate was, the perpendicular fall surrounding the fort
shallowed to 7-8 yards. The Turkī might be read, I think, to mean
whichever alternative was the fact. Erskine’s reading best bears out
Bābur’s account of the strength of the fort, since it allows of a cleft
between the hill and the fort some 140-160 feet deep, as against the
21-24 of de Courteille’s. Erskine may have been in possession of
information [in 1826] by which he guided his translation (p. 300), “At
its chief gate, for the space of 7 or 8 <i>gez</i> (<i>qārī</i>), there is a place
that admits of a draw-bridge being thrown across; it may be 10 or 12
<i>gez</i> wide.” If de Courteille’s reading be correct in taking 7-8 <i>qārī</i>
only to be the depth of the cleft, that cleft may be artificial.</p></div>

</p><p>
Since I wrote of Balkh <i>s.a.</i> 923 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (1517 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>), I have obtained the
following particulars about it in that year; they are summarized from
the <i>Ḥabību’s-siyar</i> (lith. ed. iii, 371). In 923 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> Khwānd-amīr was in
retirement at Pasht in Ghūrjistān where also was Muḥammad-i-zamān Mīrzā.
The two went in company to Balkh where the Mīrzā besieged Bābur’s man
Ibrāhīm <i>chāpūk</i> (Slash-face), and treacherously murdered one
Aūrdū-shāh, an envoy sent out to parley with him. Information of what
was happening was sent to Bābur in Kābul. Bābur reached Balkh when it
had been besieged a month. His presence caused the Mīrzā to retire and
led him to go into the Darā-i-gaz (Tamarind-valley). Bābur, placing in
Balkh Faqīr-i-‘alī, one of those just come up with him, followed the
Mīrzā but turned back at Āq-guṃbaz (White-dome) which lies between
Chāch-charān in the Herī-rūd valley and the Ghūrjistān border, going no
further because the Ghūrjistānīs favoured the Mīrzā. Bābur went back to
Kābul by the Fīrūz-koh, Yaka-aūlāng (cf. f. 195) and Ghūr; the Mīrzā was
followed up by others, captured and conveyed to Kābul.</p></div>

interpolated in its text, a note of Humāyūn’s on his first use of the
razor. Part of it is written as by Bābur:&mdash;“Today in this same camp the
razor or scissors was applied to Humāyūn’s face.” Part is signed by
Humāyūn:&mdash;“As the honoured dead, earlier in these Acts (<i>wāqi‘āt</i>)
mentions the first application of the razor to his own face (f. 120), so
in imitation of him I mention this. I was then at the age of 18; now I
am at the age of 48, I who am the sub-signed Muḥammad Humāyūn.” A
scribe’s note attests that this is “copied from the hand-writing of that
honoured one”. As Humāyūn’s 48th (lunar) birthday occurred a month
before he left Kābul, to attempt the re-conquest of Hindūstān, in
November 1554 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span> (in the last month of 961 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>), he was still 48
(lunar) years old on the day he re-entered Dihlī on July 23rd 1555 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>
(Ramẓān 1st 962 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>), so that this “shaving passage” will have been
entered within those dates. That he should study his Father’s book at
that time is natural; his grandson Jahāngīr did the same when going to
Kābul; so doubtless would do its author’s more remote descendants, the
sons of Shāh-jahān who reconquered Transoxiana.

<i>Memoirs</i> inserts an explanatory passage in Persian about the <i>dīm</i>. It
will have been in one of the <i>Wāqi‘āt-i-bāburī MSS.</i> Erskine used; it is
in Muḥ. <i>Shīrāzī</i>’s lithograph copy of the Udaipūr Codex (p. 173). It is
not in the Turkī text or in all the MSS. of the Persian translation.
Manifestly, it was entered at a time when Bābur’s term <i>dīm kūrūldī</i>
requires explanation in Hindustan. The writer of it himself does not
make details clear; he says only, “It is manifest that people declare
(the number) after counting the mounted army in the way agreed upon
amongst them, with a whip or a bow held in the hand.” This explanation
suggests that in the march-past the troops were measured off as so many
bow- or whip-lengths (Index <i>s.n.</i> <i>dīm</i>).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1660" id="Footnote_1660"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1660"><span class="label">[1660]</span></a> These <i>arāba</i> may have been the baggage-carts of the
army and also carts procured on the spot. Erskine omits (<i>Memoirs</i> p.
304) the words which show how many carts were collected and from whom.
Doubtless it would be through not having these circumstances in his mind
that he took the <i>arāba</i> for gun-carriages. His incomplete translation,
again, led Stanley Lane-Poole to write an interesting note in his
<i>Bābur</i> (p. 161) to support Erskine against de Courteille (with whose
rendering mine agrees) by quoting the circumstance that Humāyūn had 700
guns at Qanauj in 1540 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span> It must be said in opposition to his support
of Erskine’s “gun-carriages” that there is no textual or circumstantial
warrant for supposing Bābur to have had guns, even if made in parts, in
such number as to demand 700 gun-carriages for their transport. What
guns Bābur had at Pānī-pat will have been brought from his Kābul base;
if he had acquired any, say from Lāhor, he would hardly omit to mention
such an important reinforcement of his armament; if he had brought many
guns on carts from Kābul, he must have met with transit-difficulties
harassing enough to chronicle, while he was making that long journey
from Kābul to Pānī-pat, over passes, through skirt-hills and many fords.
The elephants he had in Bīgrām may have been his transport for what guns
he had; he does not mention his number at Pānī-pat; he makes his victory
a bow-man’s success; he can be read as indicating that he had two guns
only.</p></div>

the Turkī text agree and with them also numerous good ones of the
Persian translation. I have made careful examination of the word because
it is replaced or explained here and there in MSS. by <i>s:hb:ndī</i>, the
origin of which is said to be obscure. The sense of <i>b:d-hindī</i> and of
<i>s:hb:ndī</i> is the same, <i>i.e.</i> irregular levy. The word as Bābur wrote
it must have been understood by earlier Indian scribes of both the Turkī
and Persian texts of the <i>Bābur-nāma</i>. Some light on its correctness may
be thought given by Hobson Jobson (Crooke’s ed. p. 136) <i>s.n.</i> Byde or
Bede Horse, where the word Byde is said to be an equivalent of
<i>pindārī</i>, <i>lūtī</i>, and <i>qāzzāq</i>, raider, plunderer, so that Bābur’s word
<i>b:d-hindī</i> may mean <i>qāzzāq</i> of Hind. Wherever I have referred to the
word in many MSS. it is pointed to read <i>b:d</i>, and not <i>p:d</i>, thus
affording no warrant for understanding <i>pad</i>, foot, foot-man, infantry,
and also negativing the spelling <i>bīd</i>, <i>i.e.</i> with a long vowel as in
<i>Byde</i>.
</p><p>
It may be noted here that Muḥ. <i>Shīrāzī</i> (p. 174) substituted <i>s:hb:ndī</i>
for Bābur’s word and that this led our friend the late William Irvine to
attribute mistake to de Courteille who follows the Turkī text (<i>Army of
the Mughūls</i> p. 66 and <i>Mémoires</i> ii, 163).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1668" id="Footnote_1668"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1668"><span class="label">[1668]</span></a> Well-known are the three decisive historical battles
fought near the town of Pānī-pat, <i>viz.</i> those of Bābur and Ibrāhīm in
1526, of Akbar and Hīmū in 1556, and of Aḥmad <i>Abdālī</i> with the Mahratta
Confederacy in 1761. The following lesser particulars about the
battle-field are not so frequently mentioned:&mdash;(<i>i</i>) that the scene of
Bābur’s victory was long held to be haunted, Badāyūnī himself, passing
it at dawn some 62 years later, heard with dismay the din of conflict
and the shouts of the combatants; (<i>ii</i>) that Bābur built a (perhaps
commemorative) mosque one mile to the n.e. of the town; (<i>iii</i>) that one
of the unaccomplished desires of Sher Shāh <i>Sūr</i>, the conqueror of
Bābur’s son Humāyūn, was to raise two monuments on the battle-field of
Pānī-pat, one to Ibrāhīm, the other to those Chaghatāī sult̤āns whose
martyrdom he himself had brought about; (<i>iv</i>) that in 1910 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span> the
British Government placed a monument to mark the scene of Shāh
<i>Abdālī’s</i> victory of 1761 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span> This monument would appear, from Sayyid
Ghulām-i-‘alī’s <i>Nigār-nāma-i-hind</i>, to stand close to the scene of
Bābur’s victory also, since the Mahrattas were entrenched as he was
outside the town of Pānī-pat. (Cf. E. &amp; D. viii, 401.) </p></div>

oriental writers locate Bābur’s battle at two or more miles from the
town of Pānī-pat, and Bābur’s word <i>ātlāndūk</i> might imply that his
cavalry rode forth and arrayed outside his defences, but his narrative
allows of his delivering attack, through the wide sally-ports, after
arraying behind the carts and mantelets which checked his adversary’s
swift advance. The Mahrattas, who may have occupied the same ground as
Bābur, fortified themselves more strongly than he did, as having
powerful artillery against them. Aḥmad Shāh <i>Abdālī’s</i> defence against
them was an ordinary ditch and <i>abbattis</i>, [Bābur’s ditch and branch,]
mostly of <i>dhāk</i> trees (<i>Butea frondosa</i>), a local product Bābur also is

were out-of-heart through his ill-treatment of them, and his amīrs in
displeasure against him, but that never-the-less, the conflict at
Pānī-pat was more desperate than had ever been seen. It states that
Ibrāhīm fell where his tomb now is (<i>i.e.</i> in <i>circa</i> 1002 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1594
<span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>); that Bābur went to the spot and, prompted by his tender heart,
lifted up the head of his dead adversary, and said, “Honour to your
courage!”, ordered brocade and sweetmeats made ready, enjoined Dilāwar
Khān and Khalīfa to bathe the corpse and to bury it where it lay (E. &amp;

the burial together of head and trunk.</p></div>

but might also be a <i>nuance</i> of Bābur’s, made to shew, with other
<i>minutiae</i>, that Humāyūn was in chief command. The other minute matters
are that instead of Humāyūn’s name being the first of a simple series of
commanders’ names with the enclitic accusative appended to the last one
(here Walī), as is usual, Humāyūn’s name has its own enclitic <i>nī</i>; and,
again, the phrase is “<i>Humāyūn with</i>” such and such begs, a turn of
expression differentiating him from the rest. The same unusual
variations occur again, just below, perhaps with the same intention of
shewing chief command, there of Mahdī Khwāja.</p></div>

Possibly he confused the two. The ‘Alāī Minār remains unfinished; the

had a right to rule there. Many, if not all, of the Slave dynasty were
Turks; these were followed by the Khiljī Turks, these again by the
Tūghlūqs. Moreover the Panj-āb he had himself taken, and lands on both
sides of the Indus further south had been ruled by Ghaznawid Turks. His

unfortunate inhabitants of India bury under ground their most cumbrous
effects, and each individual, man, woman, and child above six years of
age (the infant children being carried by their mothers), with a load of
grain proportioned to their strength, issue from their beloved homes,
and take the direction of a country (if such can be found,) exempt from
the miseries of war; sometimes of a strong fortress, but more generally
of the most unfrequented hills and woods, where they prolong a miserable
existence until the departure of the enemy, and if this should be
protracted beyond the time for which they have provided food, a large
portion necessarily dies of hunger.’ See the note itself. The Historical
Sketches should be read by every-one who desires to have an accurate
idea of the South of India. It is to be regretted that we do not possess
the history of any other part of India, written with the same knowledge

“The word <i>wulsa</i> or <i>walsa</i> is Dravidian. Telugu has <i>valasa</i>,
‘emigration, flight, or removing from home for fear of a hostile army.’
Kanarese has <i>valasĕ</i>, <i>ŏlasĕ</i>, and <i>ŏlisĕ</i>, ‘flight, a
removing from home for fear of a hostile army.’ Tamil has <i>valasei</i>,
‘flying for fear, removing hastily.’ The word is an interesting one. I
feel pretty sure it is not Aryan, but Dravidian; and yet it stands alone
in Dravidian, with nothing that I can find in the way of a root or
affinities to explain its etymology. Possibly it may be a borrowed word
in Dravidian. Malayalam has no corresponding word. Can it have been
borrowed from Kolarian or other primitive Indian speech?” (Letter to H.
Beveridge from Mr. F. E. Pargiter, 8th August, 1914.)

(<i>Mustelidae</i>) <i>putorius ermina</i>, the ermine-weasel (Blanford, p. 165),
which thus seems to be Bābur’s <i>kīsh</i>. The alternative name Bābur gives
for his <i>nūl</i>, <i>i.e.</i> <i>mūsh-i-khūrma</i>, is, in India, that of <i>Sciurus
palmarum</i>, the palm-squirrel (G. of I. i, 227); this then, it seems that
Bābur’s <i>nūl</i> is. Erskine took <i>nūl</i> here to be the mongoose
(<i>Herpestes mūngūs</i>) (p. 318); and Blanford, perhaps partly on Erskine’s
warrant, gives <i>mūsh-i-khūrma</i> as a name of the lesser <i>mungūs</i> of
Bengal. I gather that the name <i>nawal</i> is not exclusively confined even
now to the (<i>mungūs</i>.)</p></div>

cherry, because it closely resembled <i>Turkī gīlās</i>, lizard. There is a
lizard <i>Stellio Lehmanni</i> of Transoxiana with which Bābur may well have
compared the crocodile’s appearance (Schuyler’s <i>Turkistān</i>, i, 383).
Akbar in Hindūstān may have had <i>Varanus salvator</i> (6 ft. long) in mind,
if indeed he had not the great lizard, <i>al lagarto</i>, the alligator
itself in his thought. The name <i>kīlās</i> evidently was banished only from
the Court circle, since it is still current in Kashmīr (Blochmann <i>l.c.</i>
p. 616); and Speede (p. 201) gives <i>keeras</i>, cherry, as used in India.</p></div>

crocodiles.]</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1823" id="Footnote_1823"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1823"><span class="label">[1823]</span></a> As the Ḥai. MS. and also I.O. 216 f. 137 (Pers. trs.)
write <i>kalah</i> (<i>galah</i>)-fish, this may be a large cray-fish. One called
by a name approximating to <i>galah</i>-fish is found in Malāyan waters,
<i>viz.</i> the <i>galah</i>-prawn (<i>hūdang</i>) (cf. Bengālī <i>gūla-chingrī</i>,
<i>gūla</i>-prawn, Haughton). <i>Galah</i> and <i>gūla</i> may express lament made when
the fish is caught (Haughton pp. 931, 933, 952); or if <i>kalah</i> be read,
this may express scolding. Two good MSS. of the <i>Wāqi‘āt-i-bāburī</i>
(Pers. trs.) write <i>kaka</i>; and their word cannot but have weight.
Erskine reproduces <i>kaka</i> but offers no explanation of it, a failure
betokening difficulty in his obtaining one. My husband suggests that
<i>kaka</i> may represent a stuttering sound, doing so on the analogy of
Vullers’ explanation of the word,&mdash;<i>Vir ridiculus et facetus qui simul
balbutiat</i>; and also he inclines to take the fish to be a crab
(<i>kakra</i>). Possibly <i>kaka</i> is a popular or vulgar name for a cray-fish
or a crab. Whether the sound is lament, scolding, or stuttering the
fisherman knows! Shaikh Zain enlarges Bābur’s notice of this fish; he
says the bones are prolonged (<i>bar āwarda</i>) from the ears, that these it
agitates at time of capture, making a noise like the word <i>kaka</i> by
which it is known, that it is two <i>wajab</i> (18 in.) long, its flesh
surprisingly tasty, and that it is very active, leaping a <i>gaz</i> (<i>cir.</i>
a yard) out of the water when the fisherman’s net is set to take it. For
information about the Malāyan fish, I am indebted to Mr. Cecil Wray.</p></div>

general resemblance with the plantain. So too have the names of the

on the question considered in the Ency. Br. (art. maize) whether maize

appears to have done the writer (Humāyūn?) of a [now mutilated] note in
the Elph. Codex (f. 238), which seems to say that the fruit or its name
went from Bajaur to Hindūstān. Is the country of Bajaur so-named from
its indigenous orange (<i>vījāpūra</i>, whence <i>bijaurā</i>)? The name occurs
also north of Kangra.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1879" id="Footnote_1879"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1879"><span class="label">[1879]</span></a> Of this name variants are numerous, <i>santra</i>,
<i>santhara</i>, <i>samtara</i>, etc. Watts classes it as a <i>C. aurantium</i>;
Erskine makes it the common sweet orange; Firminger, quoting Ross (p.
221) writes that, as grown in the Nagpur gardens it is one of the finest
Indian oranges, with rind thin, smooth and close. The Emperor Muḥammad
Shāh is said to have altered its name to <i>rang-tāra</i> because of its fine
colour (<i>rang</i>) (Forbes). Speede (ii, 109) gives both names. As to the
meaning and origin of the name <i>santara</i> or <i>santra</i>, so suggestive of
Cintra, the Portuguese home of a similar orange, it may be said that it
looks like a hill-name used in N. E. India, for there is a village in
the Bhutan Hills, (Western Duars) known from its orange groves as
Santra-bārī, Abode of the orange. To this (mentioned already as my
husband’s suggestion in Mr. Crooke’s ed. of Yule’s H.J.) support is
given by the item “Suntura, famous Nipal variety”, entered in Seth’s
Nursery-list of 1914 (Feronia Nurseries, Calcutta). Light on the
question of origin could be thrown, no doubt, by those acquainted with
the dialects of the hill-tract concerned.</p></div>

fruit like an orange, the cane that bears an acid fruit, <i>Calamus

this fruit the solvent property Bābur mentions, as well as the
commonly-known service in cleansing metal, link it, by these uses, with
the willow and suggest a ground for understanding, as Erskine did, that

one stout trunk, or stout short stem. The words placed in parenthesis
above are not with the Ḥaidarabad but are with the Elphinstone Codex.
There would seem to have been a scribe’s skip from one “rose” to the
other. As has been shewn repeatedly, this part of the Bābur-nāma has
been much annotated; in the Elph. Codex, where only most of the notes

Rajas of the highest rank, 9 Raos, and 104 chieftains bearing the titles
of Rawul and Rawut, with 500 war-elephants, followed him into the
field.” Bābur’s army, all told, was 12,000 when he crossed the Indus
from Kābul; it will have had accretions from his own officers in the
Panj-āb and some also from other quarters, and will have had losses at
Pānipat; his reliable kernel of fighting-strength cannot but have been
numerically insignificant, compared with the Rājpūt host. Tod says that
almost all the princes of Rājastān followed the Rānā at Kanwā.</p></div>

<i>Mughūl Ḥiṣārī</i>, translates by <i>az daṃbal yak dīgar</i> (I.O. 215, f.

Courteille (ii, 272) appears to render it by (amirs) <i>que je ne nomme

that is, to certain Turkī matter not included in the standard
<i>Bābur-nāma</i>, but preserved with the Kehr&mdash;Ilminsky&mdash;de Courteille text.
As is well-known in Bāburiana, opinion has varied as to the genesis of
this matter; there is now no doubt that it is a translation into Turkī
from the (<i>Persian</i>) <i>Akbar-nāma</i>, prefaced by the above-asterisked
passage of the <i>Bābur-nāma</i> and continuous (with slight omissions) from
Bib. Ind. ed. i, 106 to 120 (trs. H. Beveridge i, 260 to 282). It covers
the time from before the battle of Kanwā to the end of Abū’l-faẓl’s
description of Bābur’s death, attainments and Court; it has been made to
seem Bābur’s own, down to his death-bed, by changing the third person of
A.F.’s narrative into the autobiographical first person. (Cf. Ilminsky,

A minute point in the history of the B.N. manuscripts may be placed on
record here; <i>viz.</i> that the variants from the true <i>Bābur-nāma</i> text

“<i>amīrs auxquels incombait l’obligation de raffermir le gouvernement</i>”.
But Erskine, using the Pers. text alone, and thus having <i>khwār</i> before
him, translates by, “amīrs who enjoyed the wealth of kingdoms.” The two
Turkī words make a depreciatory “jingle”, but the first one, <i>dīgūchī</i>,
may imply serious reference to the duty, declared by Muḥammad to be
incumbent upon a wazīr, of reminding his sovereign “when he forgetteth

Sangā) for the northern limit of his dominions, and he had here built a
small palace.” Tod thus describes Bābur’s foe, “Sangā Rānā was of the
middle stature, and of great muscular strength, fair in complexion, with
unusually large eyes which appear to be peculiar to his descendants. He
exhibited at his death but the fragments of a warrior: one eye was lost
in the broil with his brother, an arm in action with the Lodī kings of
Dehlī, and he was a cripple owing to a limb being broken by a

considérable. Ces arāba pouvaient servir en partie &agrave; transporter des
pi&egrave;ces de campagne, mais ils avaient aussi une autre destination, comme

Erskine <i>translates</i> the word <i>arāba</i> by the word <i>gun</i>, but that the
<i>arābas</i> (all of which he took to be gun-carriages) being there, he
supposed the guns. This was not correct as the various passages about

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2040" id="Footnote_2040"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2040"><span class="label">[2040]</span></a> It is characteristic of Bābur that he reproduces Shaikh
Zain’s <i>Fatḥ-nāma</i>, not because of its eloquence but because of its
useful details. Erskine and de Courteille have the following notes
concerning Shaikh Zain’s <i>farmān</i>:&mdash;“Nothing can form a more striking
contrast to the simple, manly and intelligent style of Baber himself,
than the pompous, laboured periods of his secretary. Yet I have never
read this Firmān to any native of India who did not bestow unlimited
admiration on the official bombast of Zeineddin, while I have met with
none but turks who paid due praise to the calm simplicity of Baber”
[Mems. p. 359]. “<i>Comme la précédente (farmān), cette pi&egrave;ce est rédigée
en langue persane et offre un mod&egrave;le des plus accomplis du style en
usage dans les chancelleries orientales. La traduction d’un semblable
morceau d'éloquence est de la plus grande difficulté, si on veut &ecirc;tre
clair, tout en restant fid&egrave;le &agrave; l’original.</i>”
</p><p>
Like the Renunciation <i>farmān</i>, the Letter-of-victory with its preceding
sentence which I have asterisked, was probably inserted into Bābur’s
narrative somewhat later than the battle of Kānwa. Hence Bābur’s
pluperfect-tense “had indited”. I am indebted to my husband for help in
revising the difficult <i>Fatḥ-nāma</i>; he has done it with consideration of
the variants between the earlier English and the French translations. No
doubt it could be dealt with more searchingly still by one well-versed
in the Qorān and the Traditions, and thus able to explain others of its
allusions. The italics denote Arabic passages in the original; many of
these are from the Qorān, and in tracing them M. de Courteille’s notes

Abraha the prince of Yemen who [in the year of Muḥammad’s birth] marched
his army and some elephants to destroy the <i>ka‘ba</i> of Makka. ‘The
Meccans,’ says Sale, ‘at the appearance of so considerable a host,
retired to the neighbouring mountains, being unable to defend their city
or temple. But God himself undertook the defence of both. For when
Abraha drew near to Mecca, and would have entered it, the elephant on
which he rode, which was a very large one and named Maḥmūd, refused to
advance any nigher to the town, but knelt down whenever they endeavoured
to force him that way, though he would rise and march briskly enough if
they turned him towards any other quarter; and while matters were in
this posture, on a sudden a large flock of birds, like swallows, came
flying from the sea-coast, every-one of which carried three stones, one
in each foot and one in its bill; and these stones they threw down upon
the heads of Abraha’s men, certainly killing every one they struck.’ The
rest were swept away by a flood or perished by a plague, Abraha alone
reaching Senaa, where he also died” [Erskine]. The above is taken from
Sale’s note to the 105 chapter of the Qorān, entitled “the Elephant”.</p></div>

account has been preserved in Kehr’s <i>Bābur-nāma</i> volume [whence
Ilminsky reproduced it, it was translated by M. de Courteille and became
known as a “Fragment” of Bāburiana]. Almost certainly both scholars
would have judged adversely of their suggestion by the light of to-day’s
easier research. The following considerations making against its value,
may be set down:&mdash;
</p><p>
(1) There is no sign that Bābur ever wrote a plain account of the battle
or any account of it. There is against his doing so his statement that
he inserts Shaikh Zain’s <i>Fatḥ-nāma</i> because it gives particulars. If he
had written any account, it would be found preceding the <i>Fatḥ-nāma</i>, as
his account of his renunciation of wine precedes Shaikh Zain’s <i>Farmān</i>
announcing the act.
</p><p>
(2) Moreover, the “Fragment” cannot be described as a plain account such
as would harmonize with Bābur’s style; it is in truth highly rhetorical,
though less so as Shaikh Zain’s.
</p><p>
(3) The “Fragment” begins with a quotation from the <i>Bābur-nāma</i>
(f.310<i>b</i> and n.), skips a good deal of Bābur’s matter preliminary to
the battle, and passes on with what there can be no doubt is a
translation in inferior Turkī of the <i>Akbar-nāma</i> account.
</p><p>
(4) The whole of the extra matter is seen to be continuous and not
fragmentary, if it is collated with the chapter in which Abū’l-faẓl
describes the battle, its sequel of events, the death, character,
attainments, and Court of Bābur. Down to the death, it is changed to the
first person so as to make Bābur seem to write it. The probable
concocter of it is Jahāngīr.
</p><p>
(5) If the Fragment were Bābur’s composition, where was it when
‘Abdu-r-raḥīm translated the <i>Bābur-nāma</i> in 998 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1590 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>; where too
did Abū’l-faẓl find it to reproduce in the <i>Akbar-nāma</i>?
</p><p>
(6) The source of Abū’l-faẓl’s information seems without doubt to be
Bābur’s own narrative and Shaikh Zain’s <i>Fatḥ-nāma</i>. There are many
significant resemblances between the two rhetoricians’ metaphors and
details selected.
</p><p>
(7) A good deal might be said of the dissimilarities between Bābur’s
diction and that of the “Fragment”. But this is needless in face of the
larger and more circumstantial objections already mentioned.

Ibn Batūta, and the Kadwāha (Kadwaia) of the <i>Indian Atlas</i>, Sheet 52
N.E. and of Luard’s <i>Gazetteer</i> <i>of Gwalior</i> (i, 247), which is situated
in 24&deg; 58’ N. and 77&deg; 57’ E. Each of the three names is of a place
standing on a lake; Ibn Batūta’s lake was a league (4 m.) long, Bābur’s
about 11 miles round; Luard mentions no lake, but the <i>Indian Atlas</i>
marks one quite close to Kadwāha of such form as to seem to have a
tongue of land jutting into it from the north-west, and thus suiting
Bābur’s description of the site of Kachwa. Again,&mdash;Ibn Batūta writes of
Kajwarra as having, round its lake, idol-temples; Luard says of Kadwāha
that it has four idol-temples standing and nine in ruins; there may be
hinted something special about Bābur’s Kachwa by his remark that he
encouraged its people, and this speciality may be interaction between
Muḥammadanism and Hindūism serving here for the purpose of
identification. For Ibn Batūta writes of the people of Kajwarra that
they were <i>jogīs</i>, yellowed by asceticism, wearing their hair long and
matted, and having Muḥammadan followers who desired to learn their
(occult?) secrets. If the same interaction existed in Bābur’s day, the
Muḥammadan following of the Hindū ascetics may well have been the
special circumstance which led him to promise protection to those
Hindūs, even when he was out for Holy-war. It has to be remembered of
Chandīrī, the nearest powerful neighbour of Kadwāha, that though Bābur’s
capture makes a vivid picture of Hindūism in it, it had been under
Muḥammadan rulers down to a relatively short time before his conquest.
The <i>jogīs</i> of Kachwa could point to long-standing relations of
tolerance by the Chandīrī Governors; this, with their Muḥammadan
following, explains the encouragement Bābur gave them, and helps to
identify Kachwa with Kajarra. It may be observed that Bābur was familiar
with the interaction of the two creeds, witness his “apostates”, mostly
Muḥammadans following Hindū customs, witness too, for the persistent
fact, the reports of District-officers under the British <i>Rāj</i>.
Again,&mdash;a further circumstance helping to identify Kajwarra, Kachwa and
Kadwāha is that these are names of the last important station the
traveller and the soldier, as well perhaps as the modern wayfarer, stays
in before reaching Chandīrī. The importance of Kajwarra is shewn by Ibn
Batūta, and of Kadwāha by its being a <i>maḥāll</i> in Akbar’s <i>sarkār</i> of
Bāyawān of the <i>ṣūba</i> of Āgra. Again,&mdash;Kadwāha is the place nearest to
Chandīrī about which Bābur’s difficulties as to intermediate road and
jungle would arise. That intermediate road takes off the main one a
little south of Kadwāha and runs through what looks like a narrow valley
and broken country down to Bhamor, Bhurānpūr and Chandīrī. Again,&mdash;no
bar to identification of the three names is placed by their differences
of form, in consideration of the vicissitudes they have weathered in
tongue, script, and transliteration. There is some ground, I believe,
for surmising that their common source is <i>kajūr</i>, the date-fruit. [I am
indebted to my husband for the help derived from Ibn Batūta, traced by
him in Sanguinetti’s trs. iv, 33, and S. Lee’s trs. p. 162.]

(Two places similar in name to Kachwa, and situated on Bābur’s route
<i>viz.</i> Kocha near Jhansi, and Kuchoowa north of Kadwāha (Sheet 69 S.W.)
are unsuitable for his “Kachwa”, the first because too near Bandīr to
suit his itinerary, the second because too far from the turn off the
main-road mentioned above, because it has no lake, and has not the help
in identification detailed above of Kadwāha.)</p></div>

<i>m:lchār</i> is found in MSS. where the meaning is that of T. <i>būljār</i>. It
is not in any dictionary I have seen; Mr. Irvine found it “obscure” and
surmised it to mean “approach by trenches”, but this does not suit its
uses in the <i>Bābur-nāma</i> of a military post, and a rendezvous. This
surmise, containing, as it does, a notion of protection, links <i>m:ljār</i>
in sense with Ar. <i>malja'</i>. The word needs expert consideration, in
order to decide whether it is to be received into dictionaries, or to be
rejected because explicable as the outcome of unfamiliarity in Persian
scribes with T. <i>būljār</i> or, <i>more Persico</i> with narrowed vowels,
<i>bŭljăr</i>. Shaw in his Vocabulary enters <i>būljāq</i> (<i>būljār</i>?), “a
station for troops, a rendezvous, see <i>malja'</i>,” thus indicating, it
would seem, that he was aware of difficulty about <i>m:ljār</i> and <i>būljāq</i>
(<i>būljār</i>?). There appears no doubt of the existence of a Turkī word
<i>būljār</i> with the meanings Shaw gives to <i>būljāq</i>; it could well be
formed from the root <i>būl</i>, being, whence follows, being in a place,
posted. <i>Maljā</i> has the meaning of a standing-place, as well as those of
a refuge and an asylum; both meanings seem combined in the <i>m:ljār</i> of
f. 336<i>b</i>, where for matchlockmen a <i>m:ljār</i> was ordered “raised”. (Cf.
Irvine’s <i>Army of the Indian Moghuls</i> p. 278.)</p></div>

accounts of Bābur’s sieges, may explain one our friend the late Mr.
William Irvine left undecided (<i>l.c.</i> p. 278), <i>viz.</i> <i>shāt̤ūr</i>. On p.
281 he states that <i>nardubān</i> is the name of a scaling-ladder and that
Bābur mentions scaling ladders more than once. Bābur mentions them
however always as <i>shātū</i>. Perhaps <i>shāt̤ūr</i> which, as Mr. Irvine says,
seems to be made of the trunks of trees and to be a siege appliance, is
really <i>shātū u</i> ... (ladder and ...) as in the passage under note and
on f. 216<i>b</i>, some other name of an appliance following.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2199" id="Footnote_2199"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2199"><span class="label">[2199]</span></a> The word here preceding <i>tūra</i> has puzzled scribes and
translators. I have seen the following variants in MSS.;&mdash;<i>nūkrī</i> or
<i>tūkrī</i>, <i>b:krī</i> or <i>y:krī</i>, <i>būkrī</i> or <i>yūkrī</i>, <i>būkrāī</i> or <i>yūkrāī</i>,
in each of which the <i>k</i> may stand for <i>g</i>. Various suggestions might be
made as to what the word is, but all involve reading the Persian
enclitic <i>ī</i> (forming the adjective) instead of Turkī <i>līk</i>. Two roots,
<i>tīg</i> and <i>yūg</i>, afford plausible explanations of the unknown word;
appliances suiting the case and able to bear names formed from one or
other of these roots are <i>wheeled mantelet</i>, and <i>head-strike</i> (P.
<i>sar-kob</i>). That the word is difficult is shewn not only by the variants
I have quoted, but by Erskine’s reading <i>naukarī tūra</i>, “to serve the
<i>tūras</i>,” a requisite not specified earlier by Bābur, and by de
Courteille’s paraphrase, <i>tout ce qui est nécessaire aux touras</i>.</p></div>

inasmuch as it says nothing of the general massacre of pagans he has
mentioned on f. 272. Khẉāfī Khān records the massacre, saying, that
after the fort was surrendered, as was done on condition of safety for
the garrison, from 3 to 4000 pagans were put to death by Bābur’s troops
on account of hostility shewn during the evacuation of the fort. The
time assigned to the massacre is previous to the <i>jūhar</i> of 1000 women
and children and the self-slaughter of men in Medinī Rāo’s house, in
which he himself died. It is not easy to fit the two accounts in; this
might be done, however, by supposing that a folio of Bābur’s MS. was
lost, as others seem lost at the end of the narrative of this year’s
events (<i>q.v.</i>). The lost folio would tell of the surrender, one clearly
affecting the mass of Rājpūt followers and not the chiefs who stood for
victory or death and who may have made sacrifice to honour after hearing
of the surrender. Bābur’s narrative in this part certainly reads less
consecutive than is usual with him; something preceding his account of
the <i>jūhar</i> would improve it, and would serve another purpose also,
since mention of the surrender would fix a term ending the now too short
time of under one hour he assigns as the duration of the fighting. If a
surrender had been mentioned, it would be clear that his “2 or 3
<i>garīs</i>” included the attacking and taking of the <i>dū-tahī</i> and down to
the retreat of the Rājpūts from the walls. On this Bābur’s narrative of
the unavailing sacrifice of the chiefs would follow in due order. Khẉāfī
Khān is more circumstantial than Firishta who says nothing of surrender
or massacre, but states that 6000 men were killed fighting. Khẉāfī
Khān’s authorities may throw light on the matter, which so far does not
hang well together in any narrative, Bābur’s, Firishta’s, or Khẉāfī
Khān’s. One would like to know what led such a large body of Rājpūts to
surrender so quickly; had they been all through in favour of accepting
terms? One wonders, again, why from 3 to 4000 Rājpūts did not put up a
better resistance to massacre. Perhaps their assailants were Turks,
stubborn fighters down to 1915 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span></p></div>

acquaintance with such expressions in French does not allow me to know
whether his words are a statement of latitude. It occurs to me against
this being so, that Bābur uses other words when he gives the latitude of
Samarkand (f. 44<i>b</i>); and also that he has shewn attention to the
Pole-star as a guide on a journey (f. 203, where he uses the more common
word <i>Qut̤b</i>). Perhaps he notes its lower altitude when he is far south,
in the way he noted the first rise of Canopus to his view (f. 125).</p></div>

Multān by his elder brother Kāmrān, transferred from Qandahār [Index;
JRAS. 1908 p. 829 para. (1)]. This transfer, it is safe to say, was due
to Bābur’s resolve to keep Kābul in his own hands, a resolve which his
letters to Humāyūn (f. 348), to Kāmrān (f. 359), and to Khwāja Kalān (f.
359) attest, as well as do the movements of his family at this time.
What would make the stronger government of Kāmrān seem now more “for the

<i>‘imārat</i> is that the words “palace”, “<i>palais</i>”, and “residence” used
for it respectively by Erskine, de Courteille, and, previous to the
Hindūstān Section, by myself, are too limited in meaning to serve for
Bābur’s uses of it in Hindūstān; and this (1) because he uses it
throughout his writings for buildings under palatial rank (<i>e.g.</i> those
of high and low in Chandīrī); (2) because he uses it in Hindūstān for
non-residential buildings (<i>e.g.</i> for the Bādalgarh outwork, f. 341<i>b</i>,
and a Hindū temple <i>ib.</i>); and (3) because he uses it for the word
“building” in the term building-stone, f. 335<i>b</i> and f. 339<i>b</i>.
<i>Building</i> is the comprehensive word under which all his uses of it
group. For labouring this point a truism pleads my excuse, namely, that
a man’s vocabulary being characteristic of himself, for a translator to
increase or diminish it is to intrude on his personality, and this the
more when an autobiography is concerned. Hence my search here (as
elsewhere) for an English grouping word is part of an endeavour to
restrict the vocabulary of my translation to the limits of my author’s.</p></div>

be remembered, without the help of detailed modern descriptions and
pictures, took the above words to say that the buildings were scattered
and without symmetry, but they are not scattered and certainly
Mān-sing’s has symmetry. I surmise that the words quoted above do not
refer to the buildings themselves but to the stones of which they are

demanded for <i>punkhas</i>. I regret that Erskine’s translation of this
passage, so superior to my own in literary merit, does not suit the
Turkī original. He worked from the Persian translation, and not only so,
but with a less rigid rule of translation than binds me when working on
Bābur’s <i>ipsissima verba</i> (<i>Mems.</i> p. 384; Cunningham p. 349; Luard p.

<i>bāra-dūrī</i>, a twelve-doored open hall, and must have been light. His
“originally” points to the view that the hall had been altered before
Bābur saw it but as it was only about 10 years old at that time, it was
in its first form, presumably. Perhaps Bābur saw it in a bad light. The
dimensions Cunningham gives of it suggest that the high dome must have
been frequently ill-lighted.</p></div>

for its diminutive <i>tālār-ghina</i> is still more difficult. Raḥīm-dād’s
<i>tālār</i>-ette will have stood on the flat centre of the dome, raised on
four pillars or perhaps with its roof only so-raised; one is sure there
would be a roof as protection against sun or moon. It may be noted that
the dome is not visible outside from below, but is hidden by the
continuation upwards of walls which form a mean-looking parallelogram of
masonry.</p></div>

so. Bābur’s word is not <i>gaz</i> a measure of 24 fingers-breadth, but
<i>qārī</i>, the length from the tip of the shoulder to the fingers-ends; it
is about 33 inches, not less, I understand. Thus stated in <i>qārīs</i>
Bābur’s estimate of the height comes very near Cunningham’s, being a
good 55 ft. to 57 ft. (I may note that I have usually translated <i>qārī</i>
by “yard”, as the yard is its nearest English equivalent. The Pers. trs.
of the B. N. translates by <i>gaz</i>, possibly a larger <i>gaz</i> than that of

not; nor is this name of a Gate found. It might be that of the
Dhonda-paur (Cunningham, p. 339). The 1st Pers. trs. [I.O. 215 f. 210]
omits the word <i>rozan</i> (or, <i>auz:n</i>); the 2nd [I.O. 217 f. 236b] renders
it by <i>jā’ī</i>, place. Manifestly the Gate was opened by Bābur, but,
presumably, not precisely at the time of his visit. I am inclined to
understand that <i>rozan</i> ... <i>tafarruj karda</i> means enjoying the window
formerly used by Muḥammadan rulers. If <i>aūz:n</i> be the right reading, its

Sunday, Muḥ. 19th, and the one next following, <i>viz.</i> Saturday, Ṣafar
3rd, the diary of six days is wanting. The gap seems to be between the
unfinished account of doings in Dhūlpūr and the incomplete one of those
of the Monday of the party. For one of the intermediate days Bābur had
made an appointment, when in Gūālīār (f. 343), with the envoys of
Bikramājīt, the trysting-day being Muḥ. 23rd (<i>i.e.</i> 9 days after Muḥ.
14th). Bābur is likely to have gone to Bīāna as planned; that envoys met
him there may be surmised from the circumstance that when negociations
with Bikramājīt were renewed in Āgra (f. 345), two sets of envoys were
present, a “former” one and a “later” one, and this although all envoys
had been dismissed from Gūālīār. The “former” ones will have been those
who went to Bīāna, were not given leave there, but were brought on to
Āgra; the “later” ones may have come to Āgra direct from Ranthaṃbhor. It
suits all round to take it that pages have been lost on which was the
record of the end of the Dhūlpūr visit, of the journey to the, as yet
unseen, fort of Bīāna, of tryst kept by the envoys, of other doings in
Bīāna where, judging from the time taken to reach Sīkrī, it may be that
the <i>ma‘jūn</i> party was held.</p></div>

diviner (Erskine, water-finder), a <i>jība-gar</i>, cuirass-maker, or a

describes the kind of well he had in hand, perhaps the stone one of f.

European literature only through Bābur’s metrical translation of it; and
this, again, is known only through the <i>Rāmpūr Dīwān</i>. [It may be noted
here, though the topic belongs to the beginning of the <i>Bābur-nāma</i> (f.

accounts (Index <i>s.n.</i> Jām) are merely repetitions of news given to him;
he is not responsible for mistakes he records, such as those of f. 354.
It must be mentioned that Mr. Erskine has gone wrong in his description
of the battle, the starting-point of error being his reversal of two
events, the encampment of T̤ahmāsp at Rādagān and his passage through
Mashhad. A century ago less help, through maps and travel, was available

Aūzbeg muster in Merv, was Herāt, near which ‘Ubaid Khān had been for 7
months. He did not take the shortest route for Mashhad, <i>viz.</i> the
Dāmghān-Sabzawār-Nīshāpūr road, but went from Dāmghān for Mashhad by way
of Kālpūsh (<i>‘Ālam-ārāī</i> lith. ed. p. 45) and Rādagān. Two military
advantages are obvious on this route; (1) it approaches Mashhad by the
descending road of the Kechef-valley, thus avoiding the climb into that
valley by a pass beyond Nīshāpūr on the alternative route; and (2) it
passes through the fertile lands of Rādagān. [For Kālpūsh and the route

reports (<i>Persia</i>, ii, 120) that his interlocutors on the spot were not
able to explain the word “Radkan,” it may be useful to note here that
the town seems to borrow its name from the ancient tower standing near
it, the <i>Mīl-i-rādagān</i>, or, as Réclus gives it, <i>Tour de méimandan</i>,
both names meaning, Tower of the bounteous (or, beneficent,
highly-distinguished, <i>etc.</i>). (Cf. Vullers Dict. <i>s.n.</i> <i>rād</i>; Réclus’
<i>L’Asie Antérieure</i> p. 219; and O’Donovan’s <i>Merv Oasis</i>.) Perhaps light
on the distinguished people (<i>rādagān</i>) is given by the <i>Dābistān’s</i>
notice of an ancient sect, the Rādīyān, seeming to be fire-worshippers
whose chief was Rād-gūna, an eminently brave hero of the latter part of
Jāmshīd’s reign (800 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>?). Of the town Rādagān Daulat Shāh makes

Scorpio to follow Virgo in Sept.-Oct. according to the ancient view of
the Zodiacal Signs which allotted two houses to the large Scorpio and,
if it admitted Libra at all, placed it between Scorpio’s claws (Virgil’s

T̤ahmāsp was encamped at Rādagān, expected to interpose themselves in
his way at Mashhad and to get their 20,000 to Rādagān before he broke
camp. T̤āhmāsp’s swiftness spoiled their plan; he will have stayed at
Rādagān a short time only, perhaps till he had further news of the
Aūzbegs, perhaps also for commissariat purposes and to rest his force.

hamlet or suburb of Jām. The <i>‘Ālam-ārāī</i> (lith. ed. p. 40) writes
Khusrau-jard-i-Jām (the Khusrau-throne of Jām), perhaps rhetorically.
The hamlet is Maulānā ‘Abdu’r-raḥmān <i>Jāmī’s</i> birthplace (Daulat Shāh’s
<i>Taẕkirat</i>, E. G. Browne’s ed. p. 483). Jām now appears on maps as

but that as his cause was not good, their supplications were turned
backwards, and that all were slain where they had prayed.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2349" id="Footnote_2349"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2349"><span class="label">[2349]</span></a> Here the 1st Pers. trs. (I.O. 215 f. 214) mentions that
it was Chalma who wrote and despatched the exact particulars of the
defeat of the Aūzbegs. This information explains the presumption Bābur
expresses. It shows that Chalma was in Ḥiṣār where he may have written
his letter to give news to Humāyūn. At the time Bīān Shaikh left, the
Mīrzā was near Kishm; if he had been the enterprising man he was not,
one would surmise that he had moved to seize the chance of the sult̤āns’
abandonment of Ḥiṣār, without waiting for his father’s urgency (f.
348<i>b</i>). Whether he had done so and was the cause of the sult̤āns’
flight, is not known from any chronicle yet come to our hands. Chalma’s
father Ibrāhīm <i>Jānī</i> died fighting for Bābur against Shaibāq Khān in
906 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (f. 90<i>b</i>).
</p><p>
As the sense of the name-of-office Chalma is still in doubt, I suggest
that it may be an equivalent of <i>aftābachī</i>, bearer of the water-bottle
on journeys. <i>T. chalma</i> can mean a water-vessel carried on the
saddle-bow; one Chalma on record was a <i>safarchī</i>; if, in this word,
<i>safar</i> be read to mean journey, an approach is made to <i>aftābachī</i>

Dynasties</i>). It would be natural for Bābur to comment on the mistake,
since envoys from two of the sult̤āns reported killed, were in Āgra.
There had been time for the facts to be known: the battle was fought on
Sep. 26th; the news of it was in Āgra on Nov. 23rd; envoys from both
adversaries were at Bābur’s entertainment on Dec. 19th. From this

(<i>T.-i-T̤.</i> p. 11):&mdash;“I marched against the Aūzbegs. The battle took
place outside Jām. At the first onset, Aūzbeg prevailed over Qīzīl-bāsh.
Ya‘qūb Sl. fled and Sl. Wālāma <i>Taklū</i> and other officers of the right
wing were defeated and put to flight. Putting my trust in God, I prayed
and advanced some paces.... One of my body-guard getting up with ‘Ubaid
struck him with a sword, passed on, and occupied himself with another.
Qūlīj Bahādur and other Aūzbegs carried off the wounded ‘Ubaid;
Kūchkūnjī (Kūchūm) Khān and Jānī Khān Beg, when they became aware of
this state of affairs, fled to Merv. Men who had fled from our army
rejoined us that day. That night I spent on the barren plain (<i>ṣaḥra'</i>).
I did not know what had happened to ‘Ubaid. I thought perhaps they were
devising some stratagem against me.” The ‘A.-‘A. says that ‘Ubaid’s
assailant, on seeing his low stature and contemptible appearance, left
him for a more worthy foe.</p></div>

to do which shows fairly well that the “same day” will be not Tuesday
the 16th but Thursday the 18th. Ghīāṣu’d-dīn’s reception was on the day
preceding Friday 19th, so that part of Thursday’s record (as shewn by
“on this same day”), the whole of Wednesday’s, and (to suit an expected
comment by Bābur on the discrepant story of the Aūzbeg deaths) part of

item reported by Humāyūn, that there was talk of peace. Bābur replied
that, if the time for negotiation were not past, Humāyūn was to make
peace until such time as the affairs of Hindūstān were cleared off. This
is followed in the A. N. by a seeming quotation from Bābur’s letter,
saying in effect that he was about to leave Hindūstān, and that his
followers in Kābul and Tramontana must prepare for the expedition
against Samarkand which would be made on his own arrival. None of the
above matter is now with the <i>Bābur-nāma</i>; either it was there once, was
used by Abū’l-faz̤l and lost before the Persian trss. were made; or
Abū’l-faẓl used Bābur’s original, or copied, letter itself. That desire
for peace prevailed is shewn by several matters:&mdash;T̤ahmāsp, the victor,
asked and obtained the hand of an Aūzbeg in marriage; Aūzbeg envoys came
to Āgra, and with them Turk Khwājas having a mission likely to have been
towards peace (f. 357<i>b</i>); Bābur’s wish for peace is shewn above and on
f. 359 in a summarized letter to Humāyūn. (Cf. Abū’l-ghāzī’s
<i>Shajarat-i-Turk</i> [<i>Histoire des Mongols</i>, Désmaisons’ trs. p. 216];
<i>Akbar-nāma</i>, H. B.’s trs. i, 270.)
</p><p>
A here-useful slip of reference is made by the translator of the
<i>Akbar-nāma</i> (<i>l.c.</i> n. 3) to the Fragment (<i>Mémoires</i> ii, 456) instead
of to the <i>Bābur-nāma</i> translation (<i>Mémoires</i> ii, 381). The utility of
the slip lies in its accompanying comment that de C.’s translation is in
closer agreement with the <i>Akbar-nāma</i> than with Bābur’s words. Thus the
<i>Akbar-nāma</i> passage is brought into comparison with what it is now safe
to regard as its off-shoot, through Turkī and French, in the Fragment.
When the above comment on their resemblance was made, we were less
assured than now as to the genesis of the Fragment (Index <i>s.n.</i>

Turkī word <i>tūghāī</i> to mean bend of a river, and as referring to the one
shaped (on the map) like a soda-water bottle, its neck close to Rāprī.
Bābur avoided it by taking boat below its mouth.&mdash;In neither Persian
translation has <i>tūghāī</i> been read to mean a bend of a river; the first
has <i>az pāyān rūīa Rāprī</i>, perhaps referring to the important ford
(<i>pāyān</i>); the second has <i>az zīr bulandī kalān Rāprī</i>, perhaps
referring to a height at the meeting of the bank of the ravine down
which the road to the ford comes, with the high bank of the river. Three
examples of <i>tūghāī</i> or <i>tūqāī</i> [a synonym given by Dictionaries], can
be seen in Abū’l-ghāzī’s <i>Shajrat-i-Turk</i>, Fræhn’s imprint, pp. 106,
107, 119 (Désmaisons’ trs. pp. 204, 205, 230). In each instance
Désmaisons renders it by <i>coude</i>, elbow, but one of the examples may

dense forest by the side of a river (Vambéry), prairie (Zenker), and

Bābur now fashions a line-marker for 11. He has already despatched 4
copies of the translation (f. 357<i>b</i>); he will have judged them
unsatisfactory; hence to give space for the mixture of hands (<i>tarkīb

Bābur when on the east bank, writes of coming opposite to it (<i>supra</i>

halting-place somewhere near the Akbarpūr of later name, which stands on
a road and at a ferry. But if the army did a stage on Tuesday, of which
Bābur omits mention, Wednesday’s march might well bring him opposite to
Hamirpūr and to the “Rampur”-ferry. The verbal approximation of Ārampūr
and “Rampur” arrests attention.&mdash;Local encroachment by the river, which

support his view that Bābur’s title for his book was <i>Waqāī‘</i>, and not
<i>Bābur-nāma</i> which, indeed, Teufel describes as the <i>Kazaner Ausgabe
adoptirte Titel</i>. <i>Bābur-nāma</i>, however, is the title [or perhaps,
merely scribe’s name] associated both with Kehr’s text and with the
Ḥaidarābād Codex.&mdash;I have found no indication of the selection by Bābur
of any title; he makes no mention of the matter and where he uses the
word <i>waqāī‘</i> or its congeners, it can be read as a common noun. In his
colophon to the <i>Rāmpūr Dīwān</i>, it is a parallel of <i>ash‘ār</i>, poems.
Judging from what is found in the <i>Mubīn</i>, it may be right to infer
that, if he had lived to complete his book&mdash;now broken off <i>s.a.</i> 914
<span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (f. 216<i>b</i>)&mdash;he would have been explicit as to its title, perhaps
also as to his grounds for choosing it. Such grounds would have found
fitting mention in a preface to the now abrupt opening of the
<i>Bābur-nāma</i> (f. 1<i>b</i>), and if the <i>Malfūzāt-i-tīmūrī</i> be Tīmūr’s
authentic autobiography, this book might have been named as an ancestral
example influencing Bābur to write his own. Nothing against the
authenticity of the <i>Malfūzāt</i> can be inferred from the circumstance
that Bābur does not name it, because the preface in which such mention
would be in harmony with <i>e.g.</i> his <i>Walidiyyah</i> preface, was never
written. It might accredit the <i>Malfūzāt</i> to collate passages having
common topics, as they appear in the <i>Bābur-nāma</i>, <i>Malfūzāt-i-tīmūrī</i>
and <i>Z̤afar-nāma</i> (cf. E. &amp; D.’s H. of I. iv, 559 for a discussion by

record of 934 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (f. 339). It is singular that the Pers. trss. make no
mention of Pīāg or of Sīr-auliya; their omission arouses speculation, as
to in which text, the Turkī or Persian, it was first tried to fill what
remains a gap in the Ḥai. Codex. A second seeming sign of disorder is
the incomplete sentence <i>yūrtgha kīlīb</i>, which is noted below. A third
is the crowd of incidents now standing under “Tuesday”. A fourth, and an
important matter, is that on grounds noted at the end of the swimming

935 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (April 4th, 1529 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span> f. 366<i>b</i>), that he had swum the Ganges at
Baksara (Buxar) a year before, <i>i.e.</i> on or close to Rajab 25th, 934 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>
(April 15th, 1528 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>). Nothing in his writings shews that he was near
Pīāg (Allāhābād) in 934 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>; nothing indisputably connects the swimming
episode with the “Tuesday” below which it now stands; there is no help
given by dates. One supposes Bābur would take his first chance to swim
the Ganges; this was offered at Qanauj (f. 336), but nothing in the
short record of that time touches the topic. The next chance would be
after he was in Aūd, when, by an unascertained route, perhaps down the
Ghogrā, he made his way to Baksara where he says (f. 366<i>b</i>) he swam the
river. Taking into consideration the various testimony noted, [Index
<i>s.n.</i> swimming] there seems warrant for supposing that this swimming
passage is a survival of the missing record of 934 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (f. 339). Cf. f.
377<i>b</i>, p. 680 and n. 2 for another surmised survival of 934 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2529" id="Footnote_2529"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2529"><span class="label">[2529]</span></a> From the particulars Bābur gives about the Tūs (Tons)
and Karmā-nāśā, it would seem that he had not passed them last year,
an inference supported by what is known of his route in that year:&mdash;He
came from Gūālīār to the Kanār-passage (f. 336), there crossed the Jumna
and went direct to Qanauj (f. 335), above Qanauj bridged the Ganges,
went on to Bangarmāu (f. 338), crossed the Gūmtī and went to near the
junction of the Ghogrā and Sardā (f. 338<i>b</i>). The next indication of his
route is that he is at Baksara, but whether he reached it by water down
the Ghogrā, as his meeting with Muḥ. Ma‘rūf <i>Farmūlī</i> suggests (f. 377),
or by land, nothing shews. From Baksara (f. 366) he went up-stream to
Chausa (f. 365<i>b</i>), on perhaps to Sayyidpūr, 2m. from the mouth of the
Gūmtī, and there left the Ganges for Jūnpūr (f. 365). I have found
nothing about his return route to Āgra; it seems improbable that he
would go so far south as to near Pīāg; a more northerly and direct road
to Fatḥpūr and Sarāī Bāburpūr may have been taken.&mdash;Concerning Bābur’s
acts in 934 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> the following item, (met with since I was working on 934
<span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>), continues his statement (f. 338<i>b</i>) that he spent a few days near
Aūd (Ajōdhya) to settle its affairs. The <i>D.G. of Fyzābāa</i> (H. E.
Nevill) p. 173 says “In 1528 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span> Bābur came to Ajodhya (Aūd) and halted
a week. He destroyed the ancient temple” (marking the birth-place of
Rāma) “and on its site built a mosque, still known as Bābur’s Mosque....
It has two inscriptions, one on the outside, one on the pulpit; both are
in Persian; and bear the date 935 <i>AH.</i>” This date may be that of the
completion of the building.&mdash;(<i>Corrigendum</i>:&mdash;On f. 339 n. 1, I have too
narrowly restricted the use of the name Sarjū. Bābur used it to describe
what the maps of Arrowsmith and Johnson shew, and not only what the
<i>Gazetteer of India</i> map of the United Provinces does. It applies to the
Sardā (f. 339) as Bābur uses it when writing of the fords.)</p></div>

the meaning of the phrase <i>dastak bīla aūtūb</i> is caused by finding that
while here de Courteille agrees with Erskine in taking it to mean
swimming, he varies later (f. 373<i>b</i>) to <i>appuyés sur une pi&egrave;ce de
bois</i>. Taking the Persian translations of three passages about crossing
water into consideration (p. 655 after f. 363<i>b</i>, f. 366<i>b</i> (here), f.
373<i>b</i>), and also the circumstances that E. and de C. are once in
agreement and that Erskine worked with the help of Oriental <i>munshīs</i>, I
incline to think that <i>dastak bīla</i> does express swimming.&mdash;The question
of its precise meaning bears on one concerning Bābur’s first swim across
the Ganges (p. 655, n. 3).&mdash;Perhaps I should say, however, that if the
sentence quoted at the head of this note stood alone, without the
extraneous circumstances supporting the reading of <i>dastak bīla</i> to mean
swimming, I should incline to read it as stating that Bābur went on foot
through the water, feeling his footing with a pole (<i>dastak</i>), and that
his followers rode through the ford after him. Nothing in the quoted
passage suggests that the horses and camels swam. But whether the Ganges
was fordable at Baksara in Bābur’s time, is beyond surmise.</p></div>

statement of them would have made clearer the political relations of

character and success the fruition of his mental characteristics and of
his labours in Hindūstān. (For Sharafu’d-dīn <i>Munīrī</i>, cf.

have been considerably longer in Bābur’s day than now because of the

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2590" id="Footnote_2590"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2590"><span class="label">[2590]</span></a> In trying to locate the site of Bābur’s coming battle
with the forces of Naṣrat Shāh, it should be kept in mind that previous
to the 18th century, and therefore, presumably, in his day, the Ganges
flowed in the “Burh-ganga” (Old Ganges) channel which now is closely
followed by the western boundary of the Ballia <i>pargana</i> of Dū-āba; that
the Ganges and Ghogrā will have met where this old channel entered the
bed of the latter river; and also, as is seen from Bābur’s narrative,
that above the confluence the Ghogrā will have been confined to a
narrowed channel. When the Ganges flowed in the Burh-ganga channel, the
now Ballia <i>pargana</i> of Dū-āba was a sub-division of Bihiya and
continuous with Shāhābād. From it in Bihiya Bābur crossed the Ganges
into Kharīd, doing this at a place his narrative locates as some 2 miles
from the confluence. Cf. <i>D. G. of Ballia</i>, pp. 9, 192-3, 206, 213. It
may be observed that the former northward extension of Bihiya to the
Burh-ganga channel explains Bābur’s estimate (f. 370) of the distance
from Munīr to his camp on the Ganges; his 12<i>k.</i> (24m.) may then have
been correct; it is now too high.</p></div>

40 and p. 41) what may apply to Bābur’s <i>ẓarb-zan</i> (culverin?) and
<i>tufang</i> (matchlock), when he describes the larger culverin as a heavy
hand-gun of from 16-18lb., as used by the foot-soldier and requiring the
assistance of an attendant to work it; also when he says that it became
the portable arquebus which was in extensive use in Europe by the Swiss
in 1476 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>; and that between 1510 and 1520 the arquebus described was
superseded by what is still seen amongst remote tribes in India, a

to have been opposite two ferry-heads, those, presumably, which were
blocked against his pursuit of Bīban and Bāyazīd. ‘Alī-qulī’s
emplacement will have been on the high bank of old alluvium of
south-eastern Kharīd, overlooking the narrowed channel demanded by
Bābur’s narrative, one pent in presumably by <i>kankar</i> reefs such as
there are in the region. As illustrating what the channel might have
been, the varying breadth of the Ghogrā along the ‘Azamgarh District may
be quoted, <i>viz.</i> from 10 miles to 2/5m., the latter being where, as in
Kharīd, there is old alluvium with <i>kankar</i> reefs preserving the banks.

Gogar (or Gagar) and Sarū (Sīrū or Sīrd), on f. 338-8<i>b</i>, that whereas
the rebels were, earlier, for crossing Sarū only, <i>i.e.</i> the Ghogrā
below its confluence with the Sarda, they had now changed for crossing
above the confluence and further north. Such a change is explicable by
desire to avoid encounter with Bābur’s following, here perhaps the army
of Aūd, and the same desire is manifested by their abandonment of a fort
captured (f. 377<i>b</i>) some days before the rumour reached Bābur of their
crossing Sarū and Gogar.&mdash;Since translating the passage on f. 338, I
have been led, by enforced attention to the movement of the confluence
of Ghogrā with Ganges (Sarū with Gang) to see that that translation,
eased in obedience to distances shewn in maps, may be wrong and that
Bābur’s statement that he dismounted 2-3 <i>kurohs</i> (4-6 m.) above Aūd at
the confluence of Gogar with Sarū, may have some geographical interest
and indicate movement of the two affluents such <i>e.g.</i> as is indicated
of the Ganges and Ghogrā by tradition and by the name Burh-ganga (cf. f.
370, p. 667, n. 2).</p></div>

variation in the MSS. between L:knū and L:knūr makes the movements of

on Ramẓān 13th. Nothing further is heard of the detachment.&mdash;That news
of the rebel-crossing of the rivers did not reach Bābur before the 18th
and news of their capture of L:knū or L:knūr before the 19th may
indicate that they had crossed a good deal to the north of the

(Oude). Cf. Appendix T.</p></div>

the <i>Memoirs</i> p. 420, and in Mr. Erskine’s own Codex of the
<i>Wāqi‘āt-i-bāburī</i> (now B.M. Add. 26,200), f. 371 where however several
circumstances isolate it from the context. It may be a Persian
translation of an authentic Turkī fragment, found, perhaps with other
such fragments, in the Royal Library. Its wording disassociates it from
the ‘Abdu’r-raḥīm text. The Codex (No. 26,200) breaks off at the foot of
a page (<i>supra</i>, Fatḥpūr) with a completed sentence. The
supposedly-misplaced passage is entered on the next folio as a sort of
ending of the <i>Bābur-nāma</i> writings; in a rough script, inferior to that
of the Codex, and is followed by <i>Tam, tam</i> (Finis), and an incomplete
date 98-, in words. Beneath this a line is drawn, on which is subtended
the triangle frequent with scribes; within this is what seems to be a
completion of the date to 980 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> and a pious wish, scrawled in an even
rougher hand than the rest.&mdash;Not only in diction and in script but in
contents also the passage is a misfit where it now stands; it can hardly
describe a village on the Sarū; Bābur in 935 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> did not march for
Ghāzīpūr but may have done so in 934 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (p. 656, n. 3); Ismā‘īl
<i>Jalwānī</i> had had leave given already in 935 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (f. 377) under other
conditions, ones bespeaking more trust and tried allegiance.&mdash;Possibly
the place described as having fine buildings, gardens <i>etc.</i> is Aūd
(Ajodhya) where Bābur spent some days in 934 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (cf. f. 363<i>b</i>, p. 655

incorrect” (Erskine). This note will have been written perhaps a decade
before 1826, in which year the <i>Memoirs of Bābur</i> was published, after
long delay. Mr. Erskine’s own Codex (No. 26,200) was made good at a
later date, perhaps when he was working on his History of India (pub.
1854), by a well-written supplement which carries the diary to its usual

approximately suiting Bābur’s statement of distance, is the lake “Tal
Ratoi”, formerly larger and deeper than now. There is a second further
west and now larger than Tal Ratoi; through this the Ghogrā once flowed,
and through it has tried within the last half-century to break back.
These changes in Tal Ratoi and in the course of the Ghogrā dictate
caution in attempting to locate places which were on it in Bābur’s day

<i>tawābī‘sī</i> but not so written). The obscurity of these words is
indicated by their variation in the manuscripts. Most scribes have them
as Chunār and Jūnpūr, guided presumably by the despatch of a force to
Chunār on receipt of the news, but another force was sent to Dalmau at
the same time. The rebels were defeated s.w. of Dalmau and thence went
to Mahūba; it is not certain that they had crossed the Ganges at Dalmau;
there are difficulties in supposing the fort they captured and abandoned
was Lakhnau (Oude); they might have gone south to near Kālpī and
Ādampūr, which are at no great distance from where they were defeated by
Bāqī <i>shaghāwal</i>, if Lakhnūr (now Shahābād in Rāmpūr) were the fort.
(Cf. Appendix T.)&mdash;To take up the interpretation of the words quoted
above, at another point, that of the kinsfolk or fellow-Afghāns the
rebels planned to join:&mdash;these kinsfolk may have been, of Bāyazīd, the
Farmūlīs in Sarwār, and of Bīban, the Jalwānīs of the same place. The
two may have trusted to relationship for harbourage during the Rains,
disloyal though they were to their kinsmen’s accepted suzerain.
Therefore if they were once across Ganges and Jumna, as they were in
Mahūba, they may have thought of working eastwards south of the Ganges
and of getting north into Sarwār through territory belonging to the
Chunār and Jūnpūr governments. This however is not expressed by the
words quoted above; perhaps Bābur’s record was hastily and incompletely
written.&mdash;Another reading may be Chunār and Jaund (in Akbar’s <i>sarkār</i>
of Rohtās).</p></div>

century later) as following Māhīm’s arrival in Āgra, will belong to the
record of 935 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> because they preceded Humāyūn’s arrival from
Badakhshān. Their omission from Bābur’s diary is explicable by its minor
<i>lacunæ</i>. Such are:&mdash;(1) a visit to Dhūlpūr and Sīkrī the interest of
which lies in its showing that Bībī Mubārika had accompanied Māhīm Begīm
to Āgra from Kābul, and that there was in Sīkrī a quiet retreat, a
<i>chaukandī</i>, where Bābur “used to write his book”;&mdash;(2) the arrival of
the main caravan of ladies from Kābul, which led Bābur to go four miles
out, to Naugrām, in order to give honouring reception to his sister
Khān-ẓāda Begīm;&mdash;(3) an excursion to the Gold-scattering garden
(<i>Bāgh-i-zar-afshān</i>), where seated among his own people, Bābur said he
was “bowed down by ruling and reigning”, longed to retire to that garden
with a single attendant, and wished to make over his sovereignty to
Humāyūn;&mdash;(4) the death of Dil-dār’s son Alwār (var. Anwār) whose birth
may be assigned to the gap preceding 932 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> because not chronicled
later by Bābur, as is Farūq’s. As a distraction from the sorrow for this
loss, a journey was “pleasantly made by water” to Dhūlpūr.</p></div>

It is known from a remark of Gul-badan’s (H.N. p. 103) that he “used to

They contribute nothing towards filling the gap of 936 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>; their
authors, being Humāyūn’s servants, write about him. It may be observed
that criticism of these books, as recording trivialities, is disarmed if
they were commanded because they would obey an order to set down
whatever was known, selection amongst their contents resting with
Abū’l-faẓl. Even more completely must they be excluded from a verdict on
the literary standard of their day.&mdash;Abū’l-faẓl must have had a source
of Bāburiana which has not found its way into European libraries. A man
likely to have contributed his recollections, directly or transmitted,
is Khwāja Muqīm <i>Harāwī</i>. The date of Muqīm’s death is conjectural only,
but he lived long enough to impress the worth of historical writing on
his son Niz̤āmu'-d-dīn Aḥmad. (Cf. E. and D.’s H. of I. art.

where he was of the first importance as an administrator, leads to
consideration of why it was done. So little is known explicitly of
Bābur’s intentions about his territories after his death that it is
possible only to put that little together and read between its lines. It
may be that he was now planning an immediate retirement to Kābul and an
apportionment during life of his dominions, such as Abū-sa‘īd had made
of his own. If so, it would be desirable to have Badakhshān held in
strength such as Khalīfa’s family could command, and especially
desirable because as Barlās Turks, that family would be one with Bābur
in desire to regain Transoxiana. Such a political motive would worthily
explain the offer of the appointment.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2704" id="Footnote_2704"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2704"><span class="label">[2704]</span></a> The “Shāh” of this style is derived from Sulaimān’s
Badakhshī descent through Shāh Begīm; the “Mīrzā” from his Mīrān-shāhī
descent through his father Wais Khān Mīrzā. The title Khān Mīrzā or
Mīrzā Khān, presumably according to the outlook of the speaker, was
similarly derived from forbears, as would be also Shāh Begīm’s; (her
personal name is not mentioned in the sources).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2705" id="Footnote_2705"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2705"><span class="label">[2705]</span></a> Sa‘īd, on the father’s, and Bābur, on the mother’s side,
were of the same generation in descent from Yūnas Khān; Sulaimān was of
a younger one, hence his pseudo-filial relation to the men of the elder
one.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2706" id="Footnote_2706"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2706"><span class="label">[2706]</span></a> Sa‘īd was Shāh Begīm’s grandson through her son Aḥmad,
Sulaimān her great-grandson through her daughter Sult̤ān-Nigār, but
Sulaimān could claim also as the heir of his father who was nominated to
rule by Shāh Begīm; moreover, he could claim by right of conquest on the
father’s side, through Abū-sa‘īd the conqueror, his son Maḥmūd long the
ruler, and so through Maḥmūd’s son Wais Khān Mīrzā.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2707" id="Footnote_2707"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2707"><span class="label">[2707]</span></a> The menace conveyed by these words would be made the
more forceful by Bābur’s move to Lāhor, narrated by Aḥmad-i-yādgār. Some
ill-result to Sa‘īd of independent rule by Sulaimān seems foreshadowed;
was it that if Bābur’s restraining hand were withdrawn, the Badakhshīs
would try to regain their lost districts and would have help in so-doing
from Bābur?</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2708" id="Footnote_2708"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2708"><span class="label">[2708]</span></a> It is open to conjecture that if affairs in Hindūstān
had allowed it, Bābur would now have returned to Kābul. Aḥmad-i-yādgār
makes the expedition to be one for pleasure only, and describes Bābur as
hunting and sight-seeing for a year in Lāhor, the Panj-āb and near
Dihlī. This appears a mere flourish of words, in view of the purposes
the expedition served, and of the difficulties which had arisen in Lāhor
itself and with Sa‘īd Khān. Part of the work effected may have been the
despatch of an expedition to Kashmīr.</p></div>

be noted here that several instances of confusion amongst Bābur’s sons
occur in the extracts made by Sir H. Elliot and Professor Dowson in
their <i>History of India</i> from the less authoritative sources [<i>e.g.</i> v,
35 Kāmrān for Humāyūn, ‘Askarī said to be in Kābul (pp. 36 and 37);

Aḥmad-i-yādgār himself because this would allot him too long a spell of
life. It may show however that the interpolations about the two Tīmūrids
were not inserted in his book by him. Its purport is that the Mundāhir
village destroyed by Bābur’s troops in 936 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1530 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span> was still in
ruins at the time it was written 160 (lunar) years later (<i>i.e.</i> in 1096

somewhat uncertain as to the spelling of the name. What is found in
histories is plain, N:g:r:hār. The other name varies; on first
appearance (fol. 131<i>b</i>) and also on fols. 144 and 154<i>b</i>, there is a
vagrant dot below the word, which if it were above would make
Nīng-nahār. In all other cases the word reads N:g:nahār. Nahār is a
constant component, as is also the letter <i>g</i>(or <i>k</i>).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2776" id="Footnote_2776"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2776"><span class="label">[2776]</span></a> Some writers express the view that the medial <i>r</i> in
this word indicates descent from Nagarahāra, and that the medial <i>n</i> of
Elphinstone’s second form is a corruption of it. Though this might be,
it is true also that in local speech <i>r</i> and <i>n</i> often interchange,
<i>e.g.</i> Chighār- and Chighān-sarāī, Sūhār and Sūhān (in Nūr-valley).</p></div>

translation volume (p. xiii) of Gul-badan Begam’s <i>Humāyūn-nāma</i>. It
surprises one who works habitually on historical writings more nearly
contemporary with Bābur, in which he is spoken of as <i>Firdaus-makānī</i> or
as <i>Gītī-sitānī Firdaus-makānī</i> and not by the name used during his
life, to find Shāh-i-jahān giving him the two styles (cf. <i>Jahāngīr’s
Memoirs</i> trs. ii, 5). Those familiar with the writings of Shāh-i-jahān’s
biographers will know whether this is usual at that date. There would
seem no doubt as to the identity of <i>ān Ḥaẓrat.</i>&mdash;The words <i>ān ḥaẓrat</i>

well-known script were varied.&mdash;<i>Mufradāt</i> was translated by Erskine, de
Courteille and myself (f. 357<i>b</i>) as alphabet but reconsideration by the
light of more recent information about the <i>Bāburī-khat̤t̤</i> leads me to
think this is wrong because “alphabet” includes every letter.&mdash;On f.
357b three items of the <i>Bāburī-khat̤t̤</i> are specified as despatched
with the Hindūstān poems, <i>viz.</i> <i>mufradāt</i>, <i>qita‘lār</i> and
<i>sar-i-khat̤t̤</i>. Of these the first went to Hind-āl, the third to
Kāmrān, and no recipient is named for the second; all translators have
sent the <i>qita‘lār</i> to Hind-āl but I now think this wrong and that a
name has been omitted, probably Humāyūn’s.</p></div>

<h2>ADDITIONAL NOTES</h2>

<div class="blockquot2"><p>P. 16 l. 11.&mdash;Niz̤āmī mentions “lover’s marks” where a rebel chieftain commenting
on Khusrau’s unfitness to rule by reason of his infatuation for Shīrīn, says,
“<i>Hinoz az‘āshīqbāzī garm dāgh ast.</i>” (H.B.)</p>

<p>P. 22 n. 2.&mdash;Closer acquaintance with related books leads me to delete the words
“Chaghatāī Mughūl” from Ḥaidar <i>Dūghlāt’s</i> tribal designations (p. 22, n. 2, l. 1).
(1) My “Chaghatāī” had warrant (now rejected) in Ḥaidar’s statement (T.R.
trs. p. 3) that the Dūghlāt amirs were of the same stock (<i>abna‘-i-jins</i>) as the
Chaghatāī Khāqāns. But the Dūghlāt off-take from the common stem was of
earlier date than Chīngīz Khān’s, hence, his son’s name “Chaghatāī” is a misnomer
for Dūghlāts. (2) As for “Mūghūl” to designate Dūghlāt, and also
Chaghatāī chiefs&mdash;guidance for us rests with the chiefs themselves; these
certainly (as did also the Begchīk chiefs) held themselves apart from “Mughūls
of the horde” and begs of the horde&mdash;as apart they had become by status as
chiefs, by intermarriage, by education, and by observance of the amenities of
civilized life. To describe Dūghlāt, Chaghatāī and Begchīk chiefs in Bābur’s
day as Mughūls is against their self-classification and is a discourtesy. A clear
instance of need of caution in the use of the word Mughūl is that of ‘Alī-sher
<i>Nawā’ī Chaghatāī</i>. (Cf. Abū’l-ghāzī’s accounts of the formation of several
tribes.) (3) That “Mughūl” described for Hindustānis Bābur’s invading and
conquering armies does not obliterate distinctions in its chiefs. Mughūls of the
horde followed Tīmūrids when to do so suited them; there were also in Bābur’s
armies several chiefs of the ruling Chaghatāī family, brothers of The Khān, Sa‘īd
(<i>see</i> Chīn-tīmūr, Aīsan-tīmūr, Tūkhta-būghā). With these must have been their
following of “Mughūls of the horde”.</p>

<p>P. 34 l. 12.&mdash;“With the goshawks” translates <i>qīrchīgha bīla</i> of the Elph. MS.
(f. 12<i>b</i>) where it is explained marginally by <i>ba bāzī</i>, with the falcon or goshawk.
The Ḥai. MS. however has, in its text, <i>pīāzī bīla</i> which may mean with arrows
having points (<i>Sanglākh</i> f. 144<i>b</i> quoting this passage). Ilminski has no answering
word (<i>Méms.</i> i, 19). Muḥ. <i>Shirāzī</i> [p. 13 l. 11 fr. ft.] writes <i>ba bāzī mīandākhtan</i>.</p>

<p>P. 39.&mdash;The <i>Ḥabību’s-siyar</i> (lith. ed. iii, 217 l. 16) writes of Sayyid Murād <i>Āūghlāqchī</i>
(the father or g.f. of Yūsuf) that he (who had, Bābur says, come from the
Mughūl horde) held high rank under Abū-sa‘īd Mīrzā, joined Ḥusian <i>Bāī-qarā</i>
after the Mīrzā’s defeat and death (873 <span class="smcap">A.H.</span>), and (p. 218) was killed in defeat by
Amīr ‘Alī <i>Jalāīr</i> who was commanding for Yādgār-i-muḥammad <i>Shāh-rukhī</i>.</p>

<p>P. 49.&mdash;An <i>Aīmāq</i> is a division of persons and not of territory. In Mongolia under
the Chinese Government it answers to khanate. A Khān is at the head of an
<i>aīmāq</i>. Aīmāqs are divided into <i>koshung</i>, <i>i.e.</i> banners (<i>Mongolia</i>, N. Prejevalsky
trs. E. Delmar Morgan, ii, 53).</p>

<p>P. 75 and n. 1.&mdash;For an explanation, provided in 94 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>, of why Samarkand was
called <i>Baldat-i-maḥfūẓa</i>, the Guarded-city, see Daulat-shāh, Browne’s ed. <i>s.n.</i>
Qulaiba p. 443.</p>

<p>P. 85 n. 2.&mdash;The reference to the <i>Ḥabību’s-siyar</i> confuses two cases of parricide:&mdash;‘Abdu’l-lat̤īf’s
of Aulugh Beg (853-1447) to which Ḥ.S. refers [Vol. III, Part 2,
p. 163, l. 13 fr. ft.] with (one of 7-628) Shīrūya’s of Khusrau Parvīz (Ḥ.S. Vol. I,
Part 2, p. 44, l. 11 fr. ft.) where the parricide’s sister tells him that the murderer
of his father (and 15 brothers) would eventually be punished by God, and (a little
lower) the couplet Bābur quotes (p. 85) is entered (H.B.).</p>

<p>P. 154 n. 3.&mdash;The Persian phrase in the <i>Siyāsat-nāma</i> which describes the numbering
of the army (T. <i>dīm kūrmāk</i>) is <i>ba sar-i-tāzīāna shumurdan</i>. Schafer translates
<i>tāzīāna</i> by <i>cravache</i>. I have nowhere found how the whip was used; (cf. S.N.
Pers. text p. 15 l. 5).</p>

<p>P. 171 n. 1.&mdash;Closer acquaintance with Bābur’s use of <i>daryā</i>, <i>rūd</i>, <i>sū</i>, the first of
which he reserves for a great river, casts doubt on my suggestion that <i>daryā</i>
may stand for the Kāsān-water. But the narrative supports what I have noted.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_878" id="Page_878">[Pg 878]</a></span>
The “upper villages” of Akhsī might be, however, those higher up on the
Saiḥūn-daryā (Sīr-daryā).</p>

<p>P. 189 and n. 1.&mdash;A third and perhaps here better rendering of <i>bī bāqī</i> is that of
p. 662 (<i>s.d.</i> April 10th), “leaving none behind.”</p>

<p>P. 196.&mdash;The <i>Habību’s-siyar</i> (lith. ed. iii, 250 l. 11 fr. ft.) writes of <i>barādarān</i> of
Khusrau Shāh, Amīr Walī and Pīr Walī. As it is improbable that two brothers
(Anglicé) would be called Walī, it may be right to translate <i>barādarān</i> by
brethren, and to understand a brother and a cousin. Bābur mentions only the
brother Walī.</p>

<p>P. 223 ll. 1-3 fr. ft.&mdash;The French translation, differing from ‘Abdu’r-rahim’s and
Erskine’s, reads Bābur as saying of the ranges separating the cultivated lands of
Kabul, that they are <i>comme des ponts de tr&egrave;fle</i>, but this does not suit the height
and sometimes permanent snows of some of the separating ranges.&mdash;My bald
“(great) dams” should have been expanded to suit the meaning (as I take it to
be) of the words <i>Yūr-ūnchaqā pul-dik</i>, like embankments (<i>pul</i>) against going
(<i>yūr</i>) further; (so far, <i>ūncha</i>). Cf. Griffiths’ <i>Journal</i>, p. 431.</p>

<p>P. 251.&mdash;Niz̤āmī expresses the opinion that “Fate is an avenging servitor” but not
in the words used by Bābur (p. 251). He does this when moralizing on
Farhad’s death, brought about by Khusrau’s trick and casting the doer into
dread of vengeance (H. B.).</p>

<p>P. 266 n. 7.&mdash;On p. 266 Bābur allots three daughters to Pāpā Aghācha and on p. 269
four. Various details make for four. But, if four, the total of eleven (p. 261)
is exceeded.</p>

<p>P. 276 para. 3.&mdash;Attention is attracted on this page to the unusual circumstance that
a parent and child are both called by the same name, Junaid. One other
instance is found in the <i>Bābur-nāma</i>, that of Bābur’s wife Ma‘ṣuma and her
daughter. Perhaps “Junaid” like “Ma‘ṣūma” was the name given to the
child because birth closely followed the death of the parent (<i>see</i> <i>s.n.</i> Ma‘ṣūma).</p>

<p>P. 277.&mdash;Concerning Bih-būd Beg the <i>Shaībānī-nāma</i> gives the following information:&mdash;he
was in command in Khwārizm and Khīva when Shaibānī moved against
Chīn <i>Ṣūfī</i> (910 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>), and spite of his name, was unpopular (Vambéry’s ed. 184,
186). Vambéry’s note 88 says he is mentioned in the (anonymous) prose
<i>Shaibānī-nāma</i>, Russian trs. p. lxi.</p>

<p>P. 372 l. 2 fr. ft.&mdash;Where the Ḥai. MS. and Kāsān Imp. have <i>mu‘āraẓ</i>, rival, E. and
de C. translate by representative, but the following circumstances favour
“rival”:&mdash;Wais was with Bābur (pp. 374-6) and would need no representative.
His arrival is not recorded; no introductory particulars are given of him where
his name is first found (p. 372); therefore he is likely to have joined Bābur in
the time of the gap of 924 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (p. 366), before the siege of Bajaur-fort and
before ‘Alā’u’d-dīn did so. The two Sawādī chiefs received gifts and left
together (p. 376).</p>

<p>P. 393 l. 4.&mdash;In this couplet the point lies in the double-meaning of <i>ra‘iyat</i>, subject
and peasant.</p>

<p>P. 401.&mdash;Under date Thursday 25th Bābur mentions an appointment to read <i>fiqah
sabaqī</i> to him. Erskine translated this by “Sacred extracts from the Qorān”
(I followed this). But “lessons in theology” may be a better rendering&mdash;as
more literal and as allowing for the use of other writings than the Qorān.
A correspondent Mr. G. Yazdānī (Gov. Epigraphist for Muslim Inscriptions,
Haidarabad) tells us that it is customary amongst Muslims to recite religious
books on Thursdays.</p>

<p>P. 404 l. 7 fr. ft.&mdash;Bābā Qashqa (or Qāshqā)’s family-group is somewhat interesting
as that of loyal and capable men of Mughūl birth who served Bābur and
Humāyūn. It must have joined Bābur in what is now the gap between 914 and
925 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> because not mentioned earlier and because he is first mentioned in
925 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> without introductory particulars. The following details supplement
<i>Bābur-nāma</i> information about the group:&mdash;(1) Of Bāba Qashqa’s murder by
Muḥammad-i-zamān <i>Bāī-qarā</i> Gul-hadan (f. 23) makes record, and Badāyūnī
(Bib. Ind. ed. i, 450) says that (<i>cir.</i> 952 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>) when Bābā’s son Ḥājī Muḥ. Khān
<i>Kūkī</i> had pursued and overtaken the rebel Kāmrān, the Mīrzā asked, as though
questioning the Khān’s ground of hostility to himself, “But did I kill thy father
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_879" id="Page_879">[Pg 879]</a></span>
Bābā Qashqa?” (<i>Pidrat Bābā Qashqa magar man kushta am?</i>).&mdash;(2) Of the
death of Bābā Qashqa’s brother “Kūkī”, Abū’l-faẓl records that he was killed
in Hindūstān by Muḥammad Sl. M. <i>Bāī-qarā</i> (952 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>), and that Kūkī’s
nephew Shāh Muḥ. (<i>see</i> p. 668) retaliated (955 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>) by arrow-shooting one of
Muḥ. Sl. Mīrzā’s sons. This was done when Shāh Muḥ. was crossing Mīnār-pass
on his return journey from sharing Humāyūn’s exile in Persia (<i>see</i> Jauhar).&mdash;(3)
Hājī Muḥ. Khān <i>Kūkī</i> and Shāh Muḥammad Khān appear to have been
sons of Bābā Qashqa and nephews of “KŪKĪ” (<i>supra</i>). They were devoted
servants of Humāyūn but were put to death by him in 958 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1551 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span> (cf.
Erskine’s <i>H. of I. Humāyūn</i>).&mdash;(4) About the word <i>Kūkī</i> dictionaries afford no
warrant for taking it to mean foster-brother (<i>kokah</i>). Chīngīz Khān had a beg
known as Kūk or Kouk (or Gūk) and one of his own grandsons used the same
style. It may link the Bābā Qashqā group with the Chīngīz Khānid Kūkī,
either as descendants or as hereditary adherents, or as both. (<i>See</i> Abū’l-ghāzī’s
<i>Shajarat-i-Turk</i>, trs. Désmaisons, Index <i>s.n.</i> <i>Kouk</i> and also its accounts of the
origin of several tribal groups.)</p>

<p>P. 416.&mdash;The line quoted by ‘Abdu’l-lāh is from the <i>Anwār-i-suhailī</i>, Book II,
Story i. Eastwick translates it and its immediate context thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>
“People follow the faith of their kings.<br />
My heart is like a tulip scorched and by sighings flame;<br />
In all thou seest, their hearts are scorched and stained the same.” (H.B.)<br />
</p>

<p>The offence of the quotation appears to have been against Khalīfa, and might be
a suggestion that he followed Bābur in breach of Law by using wine.</p>

<p>P. 487 n. 2.&mdash;The following passages complete the note on <i>wulsa</i> quoted by Erskine
from Col. Mark Wilks’ <i>Historical Sketches</i> and show how the word is used:&mdash;“During
the absence of Major Lawrence from Trichinopoly, the town had been
completely depopulated by the removal of the whole <i>Wulsa</i> to seek for food
elsewhere, and the enemy had been earnestly occupied in endeavouring to
surprise the garrison.” (Here follows Erskine’s quotation <i>see in loco</i> p. 487).
“The people of a district thus deserting their homes are called the <i>Wulsa</i> of
that district, a state of utmost misery, involving precaution against incessant war
and unpitying depredation&mdash;so peculiar a description as to require in any of the
languages of Europe a long circumlocution, is expressed <i>in all the languages of
Deckan and the south of India by a single word</i>. No proofs can be accumulated
from the most profound research which shall describe the immemorial condition
of the people of India with more precision than this single word. It is a bright
distinction that the <i>Wulsa</i> never departs on the approach of a British army when
this is unaccompanied by Indian allies.”&mdash;By clerical error in the final para. of
my note <i>ūlvash</i> is entered for <i>ūlvan</i> [Molesworth, any desolating calamity].</p>

<p>P. 540 n. 4.&mdash;An explanation of Bābur’s use of Shāh-zāda as T̤ahmāsp’s title may
well be that this title answers to the Tīmūrid one Mīr-zāda, Mīrzā. If so, Bābur’s
change to “SHĀH” (p. 635) may recognize supremacy by victory, such as he had
claimed for himself in 913 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> when he changed his Tīmūrid “MĪRZĀ” for
“Pādshāh”.</p>

<p>P. 557.&mdash;Ḥusain <i>Kashīfī</i>, also, quotes Firdausī’s couplet in the <i>Anwār-i-suhaili</i>
(Cap. I, Story XXI), a book dedicated to Shaikh Aḥmad <i>Suhaīlī</i> (p. 277) and of
earlier date than the <i>Bābur-nāma</i>. Its author died in 910 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>-1505 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span></p>

<p>P. 576 n. 1.&mdash;Tod’s statement (quoted in my n. 1) that “the year of Rānā Sangā’s
defeat (933 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>) was the last of his existence” cannot be strictly correct because
Bābur’s statement (p. 598) of intending attack on him in Chitor allows him to
have been alive in 934 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (1528 <span class="smcap lowercase">AD.</span>). The death occurred, “not without
suspicion of poison,” says Tod, when the Rānā had moved against Irij then
held for Bābur; it will have been long enough before the end of 934 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> to
allow an envoy from his son Bikramājīt to wait on Bābur in that year (pp. <a href="#Page_603">603</a>,
612). Bābur’s record of it may safely be inferred lost with the once-existent
matter of 934 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span></p>

<p>P. 631.&mdash;My husband has ascertained that the “Sayyid Daknī” of p. 631 is Sayyid
Shāh T̤āhir <i>Daknī</i> (<i>Deccani</i>) the Shiite apostle of Southern India, who in
935 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> was sent to Bābur with a letter from Burhān Niz̤ām Shāh of Ahṃadnagar,
in which (if there were not two embassies) congratulation was made on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_880" id="Page_880">[Pg 880]</a></span>
the conquest of Dihlī and help asked against Bahādur Shāh <i>Gujrātī</i>. A second
but earlier mention of “Sayyid <i>Daknī</i>” (<i>Zaknī</i>, <i>Ruknī?</i>) <i>Shīrāzī</i> is on p. 619.
Whether the two entries refer to Shāh T̤āhir nothing makes clear. The
cognomen Shīrāzī disassociates them. It is always to be kept in mind that preliminary
events are frequently lost in gaps; one such will be the arrivals of the
various envoys, mentioned on p. 630, whose places of honour are specified on
p. 631. Much is on record about Sayyid Shāh T̤āhir <i>Daknī</i> and particulars of
his life are available in the histories by Badāyūnī (Ranking trs.) and (Firishta
Nawal Kishor ed. p. 105); B.M. Harleyan MS. No. 199 contains his letters (<i>see</i>
Rieu’s Pers. Cat. p. 395).</p>Qut̤bu

<p>P. 699 and n. 3.&mdash;The particulars given by the <i>T̤abaqāt-i-akbarī</i> about Mult̤ān at this
date (932-4 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>) are as follows:&mdash;After Bābur took the Panj-āb, he ordered
Shāh Ḥasan <i>Arghūn</i> to attempt Mult̤ān, then held by one Sl. Maḥmūd who,
dying, was succeeded by an infant son Ḥusain. Shāh Ḥāsan took Mult̤ān after
a 16 (lunar) months’ siege, at the end of 934 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span> (in a B.N. <i>lacuna</i> therefore),
looted and slaughtered in it, and then returned to Tatta. On this Langar Khān
took possession of it (H.B.). What part ‘Askarī (<i>æt.</i> 12) had in the matter is
yet to learn; possibly he was nominated to its command and then recalled as
Bābur mentions (935 <span class="smcap lowercase">AH.</span>).</p></div>
